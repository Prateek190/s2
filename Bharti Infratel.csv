 Mobile tower firm Bharti Infratel today posted a 2 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at ₹606 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2018, impacted by some telecom operators closing or merging their businesses.
 The company’s net profit for the January-March period of the previous 2016-17 fiscal stood at ₹597 crore.
 The revenue of the company for the fourth quarter of 2017-18 was ₹ 3,662 crore, 4 per cent higher over the year-ago period.
 “The year gone by saw unprecedented consolidation in the Indian telecom industry with five operators ceasing to exist either on account of mergers or outright shut down of operations,” Akhil Gupta, chairman, Bharti Infratel Limited, said in a statement.
 He added that the company saw a loss of 22,134 co-locations on this account during the year. 
”...despite this, the overall performance for the year versus last year has been robust...We believe that with rapidly growing data demand which would require large network rollouts, we are poised for a strong potential in the coming years,” he pointed out.
 Gupta added that the company is “fully prepared to exploit” the market demand and will move full stream ahead to meet requirements of customers for speedy rollouts.
 The statement further said the consolidation in the telecom services industry had resulted in “lower growth rates on a year-on-year basis” on parameters like revenue, operating profit and operating free cash flow during the said quarter for the company. 
 For the full year, the company’s net profit fell 9 per cent to₹2,494 crore, while the revenue was up 8 per cent to ₹ 14,490 crore over the previous financial year. 
 The Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) at ₹ 6,427 crore for the full year ended March 2018 was up 8 per cent over previous year. EBITDA is a measure of a company’s operational performance.
 The total tower base stood at 91,451 during the just ended quarter, compared to 91,007 in the December 2017 quarter.
 The consolidated results include the financials of the company and proportionate share of 42 per cent in Indus Towers. 
 Bharti Infratel also said its board of directors has recommended a dividend of ₹14 per equity share for the year ended March 2018."

 The combined company, which will fully own the respective businesses of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, will change its name to Indus Towers and will continue to be listed on the Indian stock exchanges.
 In a BSE filing today, Bharti Airtel said its board was presented with two options with regard to its stake in subsidiary Bharti Infratel and after due consideration it decided to approve the proposal for merger of Indus Towers into Bharti Infratel. “The board decided to engage with the potential investors for evaluating a strategic stake sale post the completion of merger,” Airtel added.
Sale in the offing?
 Merger was one of the options placed before the board. The other was an offer for sale of significant stake in Bharti Infratel from a consortium of leading Private Equity investors, which was not perused at this point.
 Indus Towers is jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42 per cent holding), Vodafone (42 per cent), Idea Group (11.15 per cent) and Providence (4.85 per cent).

 As per the contours of the deal announced today, Vodafone will be issued 783.1 million new shares in the merged entity in exchange for its 42 per cent stake in Indus Towers, and this could take its holding to 29.4 per cent in the new company depending on whether Idea and Providence decide to sell their holding for cash consideration.

21,2018-05-07,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Infratel, Indus likely to invest ₹ 3,500 cr capex for FY’19 ahead of merger 
 Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers are likely to invest ₹ 3,500 crore in operations as capital expenditure for 2018-19 as they continue to operate on ‘business-as-usual’ mode till their merger happens before the fiscal-end, sources said.
 The two companies, last month, announced a merger deal that will create a $ 14.6 billion firm. The merged entity will have, in its fold, more than 1,63,000 towers across India - largest after China Tower.
The transaction is subject to regulatory and other approvals which the two companies will now pursue, starting with Competition Commission of India (CCI) and thereafter SEBI, NCLT and Department of Telecom (FDI approval). The companies have said the deal is expected to close before the end of 2018-19.
A source privy to the development said the annual financial planning continues on course for both the companies as it is ‘business-as-usual’, and that Infratel’s capex is expected to be in the ballpark range of ₹ 1,200 crore in 2018-19. 
Similarly, Indus Towers - where Infratel holds 42 per cent stake - is likely to infuse roughly ₹ 2,300-2,500 crore as capex this year, said the official who did not wish to be named.
Indus Towers is jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42 per cent holding), Vodafone (42 per cent), Idea Group (11.15 per cent) and Providence (4.85 per cent).
The amount of investment is similar to last year’s levels and will go into “new towers, tenancies and replacement capital”, the official said adding that the investments are being funded from internal accruals of the two tower firms.
A Bharti spokesperson declined to comment on a detailed e-mailed query sent to the company. Indus Towers did not wish to comment.
“The capex amount will also be used for replacement of batteries, DG (diesel generators), power equipment...As the tenancies increase, the two companies will continue to increase their capacities of mobile towers ahead of their proposed merger,” said the source.
Last month, the two entities announced that, “Indus Towers will be merged with and into Bharti Infratel through a scheme of arrangement.” The merged entity, which will be called Indus Towers, will remain listed. 
Bharti Airtel, which owns 53.5 per cent in Bharti Infratel, will get 33.8-37.2 per cent stake in the combined entity. Its final shareholding depends on what Aditya Birla Group’s Idea and Providence do with their minority shareholding in Indus Towers.
Vodafone India will get between 26.7 per cent and 29.4 per cent of the Indus-Bharti Infratel combine.

The long-term outlook remains negative for Bharti Infratel (₹259), as long as the stock stays below ₹289. The stock finds immediate resistance at ₹285 and a crucial one at ₹315. A close above the latter will change the medium-term outlook to positive for the stock. On the other hand, Bharti Infratel finds an immediate support at ₹234 and a close below that level will reconfirm the negative outlook on the stock.
F&O pointers: The counter saw unwinding of open positions on Friday, despite witnessing a gain in the underlying price. This is a signal that traders are not willing to carry over the positions and prefer to book even small profits. Options are not very active on Bharti Infratel; the little cue available indicates that it could go to ₹280 levels.
Strategy: We advice traders to buy a plain call strategy on Bharti Infratel by buying 265-call. This call closed with a premium of ₹4.45. As the market lot for Bharti Infratel contracts are 1,700 shares, this will cost traders ₹7,565. This will be the maximum loss one can suffer in this strategy if the stock fails to move past ₹269.45.
On the other hand, profit potential is very high if Bharti Infratel makes a strong up-move in this month itself. We advice traders to hold the positions for two weeks; exit if the loss mounts to ₹3,750 or at a profit of ₹5,500.
Follow-up: Hold Bank of India options (short) for one more week."

The New Delhi-based company was replying to a stock exchange query, which sought an explanation for the company’s stock price rising 6 per cent during the day. The query was raised following certain media reports that said: “Bharti Airtel surges 6 per cent post co to sell stake in Bharti Infratel.”

The stock of Bharti Infratel began its major downtrend in October 2017, from a high of ₹482.8. Since then there has been no respite. The bearish trend has not lost momentum, except for few consolidation phases. The stock attempted a recovery in the early part of 2019 appreciating from ₹250 to ₹335. But it could not extend its gain beyond that level and started to consolidate before witnessing a fresh sell-off in April.

On Thursday, the stock opened lower at ₹205 against the previous close of ₹218.2 and the year-to-date return on the stock stands at negative 20 per cent. The price has broken below the considerable support of ₹215, indicating that the stock could resume next leg of downtrend in the coming days.

Telecom infrastructure provider Bharti Infratel, which is yet to get approvals from the Government for its merger with Indus Towers, has once again extended the deadline for closing the deal to February 24, 2020. The deal, which would have created the world’s second largest telecom tower firm, was signed on April 23, 2018.
“We wish to inform you that the requisite Government approvals have not been received till date, and consequently, conditions precedent could not be completed within the extended timeline, that is December 24, 2019,” Bharti Infratel said in a regulatory filing.
The company’s board has further extended the long stop date till February 24, 2020, subject to agreement on closing adjustments and other conditions, it said.
The completion of the merger is “contingent upon receipt of requisite regulatory approvals and fulfilment of other conditions precedent”, and there can be no assurance that the merger can be completed within the extended time-frame, it added.
According to the agreement signed last year, the deal was to be completed by October 24, 2019, but was extended to December 24, 2019, as the firms did not get the requisite approvals.
The deal needs regulatory approvals including that from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and Finance Ministry among others. The merger had received certain clearances including that from the National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT) Chandigarh bench in June.
