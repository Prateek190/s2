Reliance Jio will have 496.75 MHz of spectrum in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands compared to 368 MHz for Airtel and 283 MHz for Vodafone-Idea
   -  INDRANIL MUKHERJEE


Indian telecom market is turning duopolistic after Reliance Jio has garnered additional strength with the decision to acquire Reliance Communications’ assets. Bharti Airtel and RJio are set for a prolonged battle of supremacy in one of the world’s fastest-growing telecom markets as Idea-Vodafone combine still seem at least a year away from a full-fledged operational merger.
“The market is turning duopolistic with just two major players. It will take at least 12-18 months for the entire Idea-Vodafone integration to come through and for them to optimise their resources, work like a single entity and be competitive. By then the market would have turned significantly,” says Jayanth Kolla, founder and partner at technology research firm Convergence Catalyst.
Already, in the last one year, RJio has garnered 14 per cent revenue market share and 160 million subscribers. And the numbers are going up every month, making survival difficult for weaker players.
“The moment they (RJio) achieve the critical mass of 300-350 million, they will be able to dictate terms and drive away competition barring Airtel and a very weak Idea-Vodafone,” he adds.
With RJio signing definitive binding agreements with RCom for buying spectrum, towers, fibre and media convergence node, it will have more access to the 800 MHz and 900 MHz spectrum, considered the best to deploy 4G and 2G, respectively. RJio would have 496.75 MHz of spectrum in these bands as compared to 368 MHz for Bharti Airtel and 283 MHz for Vodafone-Idea.
“Idea-Vodafone have to act much more aggressively than before as RJio now has unprecedented access to RCom’s assets like optical fibre criss-crossing the country and 43,000 towers where they can set up antennae now besides spectrum in the efficient 800 MHz band,” Kolla points out.
Moreover, dual branding could also be a challenge for Vodafone-Idea combine. While the companies have said both the brands would be retained, the strategy may make it difficult to fight the well-entrenched brand Airtel or popular RJio. “Lack of a merged brand may impact consumer acquisition,” says Kolla. The telecom industry has already seen the number of players reduce from 13 in FY 2013 to seven in FY 2018. Hetal Gandhi, Director, Crisil Research, says further reduction in the number of players and consolidation would bring India at par with global norms. “We believe this would improve pricing power of players in an industry which has the lowest ARPUs when compared to its peers.”
“It will also help improve returns for the industry over the long run and hence go a long way in improving credit profiles of players assuming other things remain constant,” she added.
Harsh Jagnani, Vice-President and sector head – Corporate Ratings at ICRA, agrees that reduction in the number of players will give better bargaining power and tariff control to operators. “This will improve their financials, which should get reflected in the long run.”
However, BK Syngal, telecom consultant and former CMD of VSNL (now Tata Communications), has a word of caution. He says a duopolistic market will be disastrous for consumers as well as public sector firms BSNL and MTNL. “In countries like the US, there is no government entity and there is a strong sector regulator and a very strong competition law. It is a mature market. This is not the case in India.”
In such a scenario, duopoly-like situation here can lead to cartelisation by the dominant players.
“And if that happens, consumer will be the loser,” he adds."

Airtel Payments Bank Managing Director and CEO Shashi Arora (file photo)




Airtel Payments Bank Managing Director and CEO Shashi Arora (file photo)


Bharti Airtel’s Payments Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Shashi Arora has quit. In normal circumstances, this would have been just another top CEO exiting. But the circumstances under which he has left have generated much discussions.
While Arora and the company said he has resigned on his own two weeks ago, sources say he has been removed from his roles because of the last few days’ controversy on the process adopted to open payments bank accounts without subscribers ‘informed consent’. This had led the Unique Identification Authority (UIDAI) to take action.


BusinessLine contacted Arora on phone, and he said January 31 will be his last day in the company and he will be joining a new sector though still based in the Delhi-NCR.
“I quit a couple of weeks ago and I am on notice period till January 31. I will be joining a non-financial-non-banking industry post that. I have been serving notice period and incidentally I will be completing 12 years with the company on January 31,” Arora said.
Queried whether he was asked to leave by the company, owing to the allegations from UIDAI, Arora said that it was not true and his decision on resigning from the company was on work for long.
“It was on the works for long and I have been discussing with the company on the same,” he added.
When asked Airtel, a company spokesperson also said that Arora had ‘resigned and not sacked’, adding that he has been an asset for Airtel, and over the years has contributed to the company’s growth story. “Shashi Arora has been associated with Airtel in senior leadership roles since 2006. Having led the operations in key telecom circles followed by building a strong DTH business, he has laid the foundation for Airtel’s Payments Bank operations. Shashi has decided to move on to pursue opportunities outside of Airtel,” the company said.
Arora joined Airtel in February 2006 and was appointed as the CEO of Bharti Telemedia, a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel that provides DTH services in August 2011. Under his leadership, the DTH business had doubled its subscriber base as well as revenue, with over two-third of the new customers coming from rural India.
Prior to this, he was part of Airtel’s Mobile business, and has served as CEO of the Upper North cluster (Punjab, Haryana, Himachal and J&K) as well as CEO of the Delhi Circle.


UIDAI bars Airtel


In its allegations, the UIDAI had temporarily barred Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank from conducting Aadhaar-based SIM verification of mobile customers using e-KYC process as well as e-KYC of payments bank clients.
As per the allegations, the company was using the Aadhaar-eKYC based SIM verification process to open payments bank accounts of its subscribers without their ‘informed consent’.
However, after a temporary suspension, the UIDAI has allowed Airtel to resume Aadhaar-based e-KYC services till January 10."

Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO of UIDAI




Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO of UIDAI


To avoid a repeat of Bharti Airtel-type fiasco, the Aadhaar-issuing authority UIDAI today directed banks to seek an explicit consent of the beneficiary before changing the account to which the government subsidy is being remitted.
Also, the banks have been asked to intimate the beneficiary about the change within 24-hours through SMS and e-mail as well as provide an option to the person to reverse the change, according to a Gazette notification issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).
The notification follows complaints of government grants, particularly LPG subsidy, being credited into the last account authenticated using national biometric ID, Aadhaar.
The situation was worse in case of Bharti Airtel, which allegedly opened unsolicited payment bank accounts of its unsuspecting mobile customers who had used Aadhaar to verify their SIMs.
The government has made it mandatory for all bank accounts as well as SIMs to be verified by providing the 12- digit biometric identification number Aadhaar.
While subsidies totalling over ₹190 crore had flown into the ‘unsolicited’ accounts opened by Airtel Payments Bank, the accounts had also got changed for beneficiaries who had multiple bank accounts as the last account authenticated became the one meant for subsidy receiving.
The UIDAI, in the notification, said the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) shall allow override requests or change of subsidy-receiving account, only if it is accompanied by the name of the beneficiary’s current bank and a confirmation that explicit consent has been obtained for the switchover.
Till this provision is implemented, “NPCI shall disable the override feature” in the Aadhaar-based bank account mapping process, the notification said.
When contacted, UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey told PTI that “a very secure process has been evolved to put an effective stop to switching of bank accounts without” informing and seeking consent of consumers.
As per the new process, banks will send request for mapping of a new account or overriding an existing bank account to NPCI only after taking explicit and informed consent of their customers, it said. Further, the banks would also have to inform each account holder through SMS and email about the overriding request within 24 hours, providing name of the current bank on the mapper and the last four digits of the account number of the new bank along with the bank name.
In case, the consumer does not wish to link the DBT to the new account, the bank will have to provide the user with a method to reverse the mapping.
In absence of an SMS or email (for those consumer who do not have e-mail or mobile connection), the physical signature on the paper consent form will have to taken by the bank prior to sending the request on NPCI mapper."

“Airtel and Tigo have already merged their operations to create a strong viable entity in Ghana. Today, it has taken yet another important step to acquire Tigo Rwanda to become a profitable and a strong challenger in a two-player market,” says Bharti Airtel Chairman, Sunil Bharti Mittal.




“Airtel and Tigo have already merged their operations to create a strong viable entity in Ghana. Today, it has taken yet another important step to acquire Tigo Rwanda to become a profitable and a strong challenger in a two-player market,” says Bharti Airtel Chairman, Sunil Bharti Mittal.


Bharti Airtel has entered into an agreement with Millicom International Cellular S.A. to acquire the latter’s entire stake in Rwanda operations, Tigo Rwanda. The move will see the country’s telecom sector consolidating into a two-player market, with MTN being the other operator.
At present, Bharti is No.3 operator in the country. The merged entity - Bharti-Millicom – will have revenues of $80 million with a 40 per cent market share.
The acquisition would be conducted through its subsidiary Airtel Rwanda. The consideration for the transaction is based at about six times EBITDA multiple, payable over two years, the company said in a statement. Further financial details were not disclosed.
“Airtel has taken proactive steps in Africa to consolidate and realign the market structure in the last few remaining countries where its operations are lagging on account of lower market share and presence of too many operators. Airtel and Tigo have already merged their operations to create a strong viable entity in Ghana. Today, it has taken yet another important step to acquire Tigo Rwanda to become a profitable and a strong challenger in a two-player market,” Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said.
Following the acquisition, Tigo Rwanda existing customers will join Airtel’s network, which currently has more than 370 million customers across 17 countries.
Bharti’s Rwanda operations had generated $22.5 million in revenues in calendar year 2016.
With in-country acquisitions, Airtel has been solidifying its market position to become a key player in the continent. In the past, Airtel had acquired assets in Uganda (Warid) and Congo B (Warid), Kenya (yu Mobile) and consolidated operations in Ghana (Millicom).
With presence across 15 African countries, Airtel had close to 83 million customers as of September 30, 2017. Globally, Airtel is ranked as the third largest mobile services provider in terms of customer base.
“The Rwandan telecom market will significantly benefit from this acquisition, further reiterating our stand that in-market consolidations do not just help achieve better market positions but benefit customers and the industry as a whole,” Raghunath Mandava, MD and CEO, Airtel Africa, said.

253,2018-01-09,Airtel,"Explain payments bank a/c issue by Dec 4: UIDAI to Airtel
The UIDAI has asked Airtel to explain, by December 4, why action should not be taken against it for allegedly opening payments bank accounts without “informed consent” of customers who went for Aadhaar-based mobile SIM verification.
Airtel, on its part, has refuted the allegations, saying all “Airtel Payments Bank accounts are opened only after explicit consent from the customer”. A company official added that Airtel is preparing to submit a detailed response to the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) within the stipulated deadline.
The Aadhaar-issuing body, the UIDAI, had slapped notices on Bharti Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank in this regard in September. A UIDAI source said the company’s initial reply was not satisfactory necessitating the need for seeking further explanation.
According to the UIDAI source, Bharti Airtel has been given time till December 4 to explain why action should not be initiated against it, including imposition of penalty on the issue.
The UIDAI official, who did not wish to be named, said that the authority had found prima facie “wrongdoings” on the matter.
When contacted, UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey said, “We have issued notice to a telecom operator and are awaiting their response. After giving full opportunity of hearing to the company concerned, we will take a judicious view of the matter.”
Pandey, however, did not identify the operator, saying the issue is under examination.
To an e-mail query by PTI, an Airtel spokesperson said the re-verification of mobile phones and the opening of Airtel Payments Bank accounts were separate transactions and not linked.
“Airtel Payments Bank is fully compliant with all guidelines and follows a stringent customer on-boarding process,” the Airtel spokesperson said.
He claimed that the consent for opening Airtel Payments Bank accounts as also Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) is taken separately from all customers. The DBT amount is automatically credited to the most recent Aadhaar-linked bank account of a customer in line with the applicable norms, the spokesperson added.
“If the Airtel Payments Bank account is the latest Aadhaar-linked account opened by a customer, the DBT automatically gets routed to it,” Airtel said, adding that such subsidy credit is also brought to the attention of the customers through a message or automated call.
It may be recalled that the UIDAI had shot off a notice to Airtel in September warning that not taking consent and informing the purpose of authentication was a violation of the Aadhaar Act and punishable with financial penalties.
In the notice served at that time, the UIDAI had said it had come to know that “Airtel retailers are allegedly opening Airtel Payments Bank accounts at the time of performing Aadhaar e-KYC verification without informing the purpose of e-KYC and also without taking informed consent of the customer"".
It also asked both Bharti Airtel and its payments bank entity to take immediate corrective measures and report back to the authority on the same.
The move came after complaints were made to the UIDAI alleging that Airtel opened payments bank accounts without explicit consent of consumers and that the accounts were then linked for receiving LPG subsidy.
Airtel Payments Bank was the first payments bank to go live in the country when it rolled out banking services from Rajasthan in November 2016.
Payments banks can accept deposits and savings bank deposits from individuals and small businesses, up to a maximum of Rs 1 lakh per account."
244,2018-01-09,Airtel,"Why did Warburg Pincus buy stake in Bharti Airtel’s DTH business?
The stock of Bharti Airtel traded flat on Wednesday despite the stake-sale in the company’s DTH business to private equity firm Warburg Pincus. The news was announced the previous evening. Bharti Airtel does not have much to lose as it will continue to hold a significant stake in the growing DTH business after the sale and the proceeds of the sale can come in handy in future.
Warburg Pincus is paying ₹1,624 crore for 20 per cent stake in Bharti Telemedia, the DTH arm of Bharti Airtel. While Bharti Airtel will sell 15 per cent of the stake, 5 per cent will be divested by another company in the Bharti group.
It is not difficult to see why Warburg Pincus is purchasing this stake. As the digitisation of cable television is still under progress, there is scope for the DTH players to improve and expand their business operations considerably. In the television content distribution industry, DTH has 33 per cent market share while the digital cable constitutes 29 per cent, with the remaining 38 per cent dominated by analogue cable. Bharti was the third-largest player in the DTH segment with 21 per cent market share in June 2017, according to TRAI.
DTH players such as Bharti Airtel have also adapted well to the changing viewer preferences by providing Internet television along with its digital television services, which is likely to pick up in the coming years.




The DTH arm of Bharti Airtel, launched in 2008, has been clocking good growth in recent times.
For the quarter ended September 2017, this business reported a revenue increase of 10 per cent year-on-year to ₹936 crore and the reported EBITDA margin improved to 37.5 per cent in Q2, compared to 35.5 per cent in the corresponding quarter last year.
Though its customer base has improved to 1.3 crore as of September 2017, from 27 lakh in March 2008, the average revenue per user (ARPU) has increased at a slower pace.
For Q2 FY17, the ARPU stood at ₹233, while for the same period last year it was ₹232. That said, the company performed better compared to the leading player in the market, Dish TV; the ARPU for this company declined 5 per cent to ₹154 for FY17 from ₹162 last year.
However, Dish TV is the market leader with 24 per cent market share, followed by Tata Sky with 23 per cent and Bharti Airtel with 21 per cent market share. State broadcaster Doordarshan too has joined the field, providing DTH services."

Bharti Airtel, India’s largest telecommunications services provider, has launched 4G services across 130 towns and villages in the country’s northern frontier including Kargil, Leh, and Dras. This makes Airtel the first operator to launch 4G services in the Ladakh region.

“As part of Project Leap, we will continue to channel investments towards building a world-class future-ready network that touches every Indian,” Ajai Puri, Chief Operating Officer (India & South Asia), Bharti Airtel said. Airtel’s network teams and partners overcame the challenges posed by extremely difficult terrain and harsh weather conditions, including sub-zero temperatures, to deploy a 4G network in the region.
Airtel’s 4G deployment will also ensure that tourists visiting the region stay connected to high-speed data services. Kargil War Memorial, Sangam, Magnetic Hill, Shanti Stupa, Leh Palace, Thiksey Monastery, Alchi Monastery, Lamayuru Monastery, Moon Land Lamayuru, Sakti towards Pangong Lake, Stok Palace and Hall of Fame are amongst the popular spots now covered by Airtel 4G.

“The investment from Airtel will enable Juggernaut to ramp up content acquisition, digital marketing and prepare for a subscription offering launch in the next few months,” an official statement said.
Launched in April 2016, Juggernaut’s former investors include Infosys co-founder and current chairman Nandan Nilekani, and Boston Consulting Group India CEO Neeraj Aggarwal. The digital platform has close to one million downloads. Earlier this year, its writers’ platform went live which lets amateur writers publish their content digitally and stand a chance to win publishing contracts.
Badal Bagri, Chief Financial Officer, Bharti Airtel, said, “Juggernaut is an exciting digital platform and complements our content vision. We look forward to working with them and supporting the next phase of their growth journey.”
Chiki Sarkar, Founder & Publisher, Juggernaut, said: “Airtel has a great understanding of digital content consumption and we have much to learn and benefit from this strategic partnership”. She added that the partnership with Airtel would allow Juggernaut to expand its distribution manifold."

As per the Broadband Wireless Auction rules of 2010, all the successful bidders are required to complete network rollout for BWA services within five years of effective date of spectrum allocation, failing which the spectrum can be withdrawn by DoT.




As per the Broadband Wireless Auction rules of 2010, all the successful bidders are required to complete network rollout for BWA services within five years of effective date of spectrum allocation, failing which the spectrum can be withdrawn by DoT.


The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has imposed a penalty of Rs 2.5 crore on Tikona Digital for delay in network rollout of wireless broadband service in Rajasthan, while clearing its spectrum deal with Bharti Airtel which has bought the company.
DoT has imposed the penalty using its discretionary powers as per the rules similar to 3G network. Tikona was able to complete the rollout obligations with a delay of about three months.
As per the Broadband Wireless Auction rules of 2010, all the successful bidders are required to complete network rollout for BWA services within five years of effective date of spectrum allocation, failing which the spectrum can be withdrawn by DoT.
“For delay in rollout obligation, a showcause cum demand notice was issued to Tikona Digital for imposition of penalty of Rs 2.43 crore which equivalent to 2.5 per cent of the successful bid amount in Rajasthan circle on October 23. The company deposited the penalty on October 25. Thereafter, its rollout was cleared,” an official source told PTI.
He further said: “After this permission for Tikona, BWA spectrum trading with Airtel was granted.”
He said Tikona had to complete the rollout of the BWA spectrum within five years from November 19, 2010 but could do so in Rajasthan only by February 11, 2016. A query sent to DoT on the issue elicited no reply.
An official explained however that the department had taken legal advice before clearing the company’s rollout. He said that DoT imposed highest penalty that could be levied as per the rules.
When contacted, a Bharti Airtel spokesperson said DoT has rightly rejected a malicious campaign while granting the permission to Tikona to trade 2300 MHz spectrum in Rajasthan.
He said: “We strongly debunk the false and mischievous campaign being driven by the forces that had previously opposed the acquisition of Tikona.
“These same forces are at work again to block the availability of 4G spectrum to others. Their objective is to thwart any competition in the 4G space.”
He added that the move will also generate additional revenue to the national exchequer through enhanced licence fee and spectrum usage charges.
“Spectrum is a national asset and once acquired in auctions and paid for, should be put to service for the benefit of customers and achieve the vision of Digitally empowered India.
“As a responsible corporate following the highest standards of governance, we are in complete compliance of all regulations,” the Airtel spokesperson said.
Tikona Digital had purchased BWA spectrum in 5 circles for Rs 1,058.2 crore in 2010 auction of radiowaves. It had paid Rs 97.32 crore at that time for BWA spectrum in the Rajasthan circle.
Later, Bharti Airtel had acquired Tikona and completed the acquisition in August end."

India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel has launched VoLTE (Voice over LTE) services in Karnataka, offering users the flexibility of high-quality voice calls and fast data sessions in parallel.
“Customers can call any mobile, landline network using Airtel VoLTE. There will be no additional data charges for VoLTE and calls will be billed in accordance with the existing plan or pack benefits,” the company said in a statement.
Airtel VoLTE works over 4G but even in the case of unavailability of 4G network, these calls automatically switch to a 3G/2G network to ensure that the subscriber is connected at all times.
“Airtel VoLTE will also enable customers to enjoy HD (High Definition) quality voice calls and high speed data sessions in parallel,” the statement added."

In its strongest action yet, the UIDAI has temporarily barred Bharti Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank from conducting Aadhaar-based SIM verification of mobile customers using eKYC process as well as e-KYC of payments bank clients.
The action follows allegations of Bharti Airtel using the Aadhaar-eKYC based SIM verification process to open payments bank accounts of its subscribers without their ‘informed consent’. UIDAI also took strong objection to allegations that such payments bank accounts are being linked to receive LPG subsidy.
UIDAI, in an interim order, “suspended e-KYC licence key of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Airtel Payment Bank Ltd with immediate effect,” sources with direct knowledge of the development said.
This essentially means Airtel would not be able to, in the interim, carry out ‘electronic-verification’ or link mobile SIMs of its customers with their 12-digit biometric national ID Aadhaar through the efficient and paperless eKYC (or electronic Know Your Customer) process of UIDAI.
Also, Airtel Payments Bank will not be able to open a new account with Aadhaar e-KYC. However, accounts can be opened through alternate methods, if available.
When contacted, an Airtel spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we have received interim order from the UIDAI regarding temporary suspension of Aadhaar linked e-KYC services till their satisfaction on certain processes relating to Airtel payment banks onboarding of customers.”
“We are engaging with the authority and are hopeful of an early resolution. We are also undertaking to complete the said actions on priority and have commenced thorough checks of our process flows.
“Being compliant to all guidelines is paramount to us. In the interim, any inconvenience to our customers is regretted,” the spokesperson said.
More than 23 lakh customers have reportedly received as many as Rs 47 crore in their Airtel bank accounts, which they did not know had been opened.
Sources said it was brought to the notice of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) that at the time of mobile verification using Aadhaar e-KYC, the Airtel retailers were also opening Airtel Payments Bank accounts, without informed consent of the user.
Government LPG subsidy was also getting transferred to these accounts, without their consent.
UIDAI observed that as per agreement with the authority, Airtel and Airtel Bank are duty bound and under obligation to ensure security and privacy of residents’ identity information.
Security and privacy of Aadhaar data is a highly sensitive matter and the Supreme Court is looking into its various aspects.
Suspending the ‘e-KYC licence key’, UIDAI ordered PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct an audit of Bharti Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank to ascertain if their systems and processes are in compliance with the Aadhaar Act.
UIDAI may consider revocation of suspension or decide further necessary action upon receipt of the report.
The alleged actions of Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank were found to be in violation of different sections of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, which mandates obtaining explicit consent of the individual. Violations are liable to be punished with Rs 1 lakh per day fine and termination of authentication user agreements.
Both Bharti Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank were appointed as Authentication User Agencies (AUA) by UIDAI and had entered into an agreement with UIDAI in February 2015 and September 2016 respectively for the purposes of availing authentication services provided by the authority.
Sources said in response to the first notice of September 18, Airtel and Airtel Bank stated that they have amended their process and the opening of a bank account is completely de-linked from the process of re-verification of mobile connection.
These replies were found to be unsatisfactory by UIDAI, which issued another notice on November 24. The company responded by saying no bank account was opened without the consent of the customers and additional safeguards have been introduced.
The replies too were found to be unsatisfactory as UIDAI continued to receive numerous complaints of unauthorised opening of Airtel Payments Bank accounts.
Sources said the interim order listed out some of the complaints and went on to state that Airtel and Airtel Bank had made “false statements” to “deceive and mislead” UIDAI.
When UIDAI reviewed the Airtel mobile app, it found that when the app is opened, along with the welcome message a pre- ticked consent box is momentarily flashed on the screen which states “Upgrade or create my Airtel Payment Bank wallet using existing Airtel mobile KYC.”
This was found to reflect blatant disregard of Aadhaar Act and Regulations."

Airtel has been given the extension, subject to UIDAI guidelines


The Unique Identity Authority of India (UIDAI) has extended the temporary permission it gave to Bharti Airtel for using biometric identity for re-verification of its mobile customers, till March 31.
UIDAI had temporarily barred Airtel from conducting the Aadhaar-based eKYC, after the telco allegedly opened accounts of its mobile phone subscribers without seeking their ‘informed consent’, and deposited LPG subsidy worth crores into them. It had last month allowed Airtel to use Aadhaar for re-verification of its mobile customers till January 10 with stiff riders, after the company returned ₹138 crore of LPG subsidy which had flowed into unsolicited Airtel Payments Bank accounts.
“The company has been allowed to continue the re-verification of mobile customers till March 31. PwC has submitted its audit reports to the authority and the Department and Telecommunications; the Reserve Bank of India is expected to give its audits in the next few days,” a senior government official told BusinessLine.
When contacted, an Airtel spokesperson confirmed that the company has been given the extension, subject to “compliance to the guidelines laid down by UIDAI.”
Sources from the company also said the firm is undertaking all the needed steps under strong supervision, and a minor issue is raised to higher authorities. Both Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank had come under fire after the Sunil Mittal-led firm allegedly opened accounts of its mobile phone subscribers without seeking their ‘informed consent’, and LPG subsidies worth crores were deposited into them.
To avoid a similar fiasco, the UIDAI last month directed banks to seek an explicit consent of the beneficiary before changing the account to which government subsidies are remitted."

Riding on a strong demand for local content, Bharti Airtel’s music-streaming service Wynk Music has crossed 75 million app downloads, since its launch nearly four years ago. While Bollywood music continued to rule, Indian regional music streams on Wynk grew more than 100 per cent.
Music in Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi and Kannada accounted for the bulk of the growth in regional content. About 13 per cent of its active users came in from rural India, contributing nearly 10 per cent to the overall daily streams, the company said in a statement.
“Affordable smartphones and increasing penetration of high-speed data services will continue to add to the uptake of music and other content on smartphones,” said Wynk CEO Sameer Batra.
Wynk has a collection of over 3 million songs, including popular music in 12 Indian regional languages.
The remixed versions of Bollywood classics to the latest hits continue to grow in popularity and made up for 13 of last year’s top 50 tracks on Wynk. This contributed more than 3 per cent to the overall streams in the year, the company added.
In a new trend, songs featured in popular ad campaigns — such as Levi’s Let’s Live How We Dance and iPhone X campaign for Best Friend — went viral on the app.
User interest in international music continued to grow, and it was users from tier II and III cities who drove streaming. For example, Shape of You by Ed Sheeran crossed 100 million streams, while Spanglish single Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, and featuring Justin Beiber, crossed 75 million."

Total revenue also declined to ₹20,319 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, from ₹23,336 crore in October-December 2016. India’s revenue for the quarter was recorded at ₹15,294 crore down by 11 per cent YoY (15 per cent on reported) on an underlying basis, adjusted for the impact in reduction of domestic termination rates, the company said.

“Regulatory fiat in the form of a rate cut in domestic interconnect usage charges (IUC) has exacerbated the industry average revenue per user (ARPU) decline in third quarter. The recent announcement of reduction in international termination rates will further accentuate this decline and benefit foreign operators with no commensurate benefit to customers,” Gopal Vittal, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, India & South Asia, said.
However, he also said the continued investments in data capacities, strategic partnerships with content and handset providers and focus on customer-friendly innovations like data rollover has led to healthy customer additions of 8.1 million during the quarter.
“The third quarter has also seen the highest ever broadband site deployment of 32,000 in any quarter, complementing the robust data and voice traffic growth of 544 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively, on a Y-o-Y basis. We are committed to remaining the operator of choice for all customers in this rapidly consolidating industry,” Vittal added.
As on December 31, 2017, the company had 394.2 million customers, an increase of 8 per cent (9 per cent underlying) as compared to 364.6 million in the corresponding quarter last year.

217,2018-03-01,Airtel,"Sunil Mittal on the importance of spectrum, reducing tax levels, coming of 5G...
In the ongoing spat between incumbent players and Reliance Jio on the latest tariff order from TRAI, there is no option but to go to court, said Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman of Bharti Airtel. 
Mittal, who is also the Chairman of GSMA, told BusinessLine on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress here that he cannot envisage anything other than a legal challenge to counter the TRAI order. Nothing, he said, can be worse than free services. Excerpts:
How do you think 5G technology is panning out? Do you think we are ready?
Back in time, LTE was exactly at the stage where 5G is today. People started to talk about LTE, but the fact is that LTE is done and dusted now. People are enjoying massive capacities. The world has dramatically altered: LTE/4G is now going to be the biggest use case for the mobile industry. I would say 5G is in exactly the same space, except that the cycle will be shorter then it was for LTE.
It is not going to take 6-7-8 years like before…industrial use cases are coming up like machine-to-machine, and so on. Mobile networks, I would say, are still a bit away, but it will happen. So, 5G will be a game-changer principally for two reasons: the hyper capacity that it gives, and the ultra-low latency. These two things will make a difference because even with LTE/4G you could not do mission critical applications like autonomous cars, robotic surgery, but with 5G, that will become a possibility. 
But is India farther away from 5G as compared to the rest of the world?
India is in step more or less. There were times when we would wait for 4-5 years for new technology and, more importantly, prices to drop for this technology (devices/kit). In 3G, we were almost side by side. In 4G, we were at par. There are many parts of the world where they still haven’t launched 4G. India is fully 4G-enabled now. 
I would say that on 5G, India would be in step. The issue in the past has been to make simultaneous investment in all the networks at the same time. Now, that will not happen. Now, 4G is almost done; by the end of this year or certainly by the end of next year, India will have all BTSs with 4G. And, we spent $3-4 billion on capex, and instead of on 4G, that will now happen on 5G.
Besides, large parts of the network are so common. Fibres, for example: it is one of the most important components for 5G, for backhaul. We are building for 4G, and we will also need it for 5G. More likely 2020 is the period when mobiles, machines and certain fixed applications will come; a few will come by the end of this year or early next year. But I would say mobile 5G looks like 2020. India will be in step for that.
But vendors say that one-tenth of the cost will be on capex and opex...
It could be even one-fiftieth. But it’s not that your $3 billion will become $200 million. It still remains $3-4 billion a year. That will mean capacity will be 20x-50x. That’s why they talk about cost being a lot. Even in this hour of difficulty and stress in the Indian market, we are still spending $3-3.5 billion to upgrade technology. I think that is what the government has to see in the New Telecom Policy (NTP). It should have the remedies to ensure that the health of the telecom industry is robust.
As the Chairman of GSMA and also with Airtel in mind, what are your top suggestions for the NTP?
I would say GSMA’s principal job is to keep on lobbying with various government bodies: ITU, FCC, all the global standard bodies and governments, to ensure spectrum availability, and to ensure a level playing field. That is something GSMA has been doing and will continue to do so in the future. Spectrum availability is the lifeline of the industry. It is the job of GSMA, which it does that all the time. GSMA does not concentrate on local issues. 
India is one of the most taxed countries in the world and is also using a heavy hand in terms of taxing the telecom industry. I think we have heard some very good initial comments from DoT/TRAI. TRAI has given some recommendations on this too. Digital India is a dream of our Prime Minister, so obviously the industry needs tax levels be lowered. One part is rationalisation of levies of our sector.
What are your views on the spat between COAI and TRAI? Will Airtel go to court?
I don’t think there is any choice for the operators. We heard the views of one of the leading operators (Vodafone) on the predatory pricing order. Vittorio Colao (Vodafone global CEO) made a very strong comment and we have heard TRAI’s response. 
This tariff order by TRAI binds operators from conducting their business in an orderly manner. I cannot envisage anything other than a legal challenge to counter this order. Nothing can be worse than free service. We faced nine months of free services and we will have to face this one too. We believe we must have the right to conduct business in a proper manner. That is what we are saying: that we will agitate at the proper forum. 
In the end, if you are my customer, I must have the right to retain you with whatever tools I have. We must be provided with the right to conduct business in the market, which is enshrined in the Constitution. That is what we are saying.
FCC has changed its rules on net neutrality to allow US telecom companies to do deals with OTT players. Should TRAI follow suit?
Net neutrality has always been a contentious issue, and my view is that there is a lot of misunderstanding that is created, sometimes by, I would say vested interests, that telecom companies will gatekeep the internet, throttle speeds, prioritise certain services, and so on. No operator can do it without causing a massive disservice to its customers. They just can’t do it. The internet is an open platform. One global debate that GSMA is trying to encourage is to set up a minimum accessible service that is available to all. And to talk of that, there are certain services — autonomous cars for example, robotic surgeries, nuclear plants, sending man to Mars — all these may require segmented speeds and offerings. Those should probably be given on a non-discriminatory manner, but not at the cost of the industry. 
Thankfully, in the 5G arena, you can slice the internet and give them those special services not at the cost of general service. I think for over-the-top (OTT) players we have been saying one thing: ‘same service, same rules’. That’s the only thing we have been talking about. The rest is that OTT players are co-existing, we get more traffic because of them and they survive because of the robust telecom networks. There is a very strong relationship between the two. The only area where it gets difficult is that they are not licensed, they do not pay licence fee, not having any access on monitoring, not having IUC..those are the things that TRAI needs to look at.
How about telecom operators versus online players?
Online players can’t be there without telecom players. Online players cannot exist where there is no network. Networks have to be there. On the issue of calling, giving them voices bundled with package... that debate has also been settled.
Are you ready for 5G spectrum auctions?
Point is what bands should be decided. Whether they are going for sub-GHz bands…that is what the spectrum will be or should have been realistic. Spectrum prices will be where they should have been, which is realistic. I mean in the last spectrum, auction has no reflection of the real price. We will be in the right zone for the new spectrum pricing. Whether the government wants to do it in one round or five rounds that they have to decide, but the pricing has to be right. My view is, it will depend on bands. Please remember, we now have sufficient spectrum and by going into 5G, we will need larger slices of spectrum. I don’t think this will happen in a hurry because the government will also have to try which bands are to be auctioned. World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) is coming in 2019 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt which will really nail the 5G debate. Its a year and a half away. The real 5G allocation of spectrum will start bringing in with some day-to-day applications, but eventually the ecosystem will be developed on the bands which are decided in WRC in 2019. For example, 3.3-3.4 GHz bands have also been tried in South Korea. I won’t give a date to the auctions. Let them (government) decide when they want to do it, but we will now take the spectrum when we need it.
Did you misread Reliance Jio’s tactics on free services?
Why do you say that? We have been the most prepared operator in India in terms of facing the onslaught of the new operator. There are only three operators now and we are holding ground. Obviously, when somebody new comes in, he will pick up momentum and get a share. The point is that with the pricing at where it is today, if we offer below that, there is no industry left. I would say nothing can be worse than free. We have faced nine months already, we will face this also.
SingTel has been increasing its share in Airtel so would SingTel take control of Airtel?
The headline message here is that SingTel even in this otherwise difficult environment in the Indian telecom industry, has absolute confidence in Airtel and stands behind it like a rock. And this last significant investment that they have committed in their holding company clearly sends out a message that SingTel, which is known as an entity of Temasek, stands behind it. To that mind, it should give a lot of assurance to a lot of stakeholders and to the companies standing behind.
Will Airtel announce some big acquisitions this year...Aircel maybe?
The Indian market has nothing left to offer. Aircel is not there. It is switching off its network everywhere. Aircel is no more an entity to be taken up. About 50 per cent of those 80 million subscribers are porting out to our network everyday. All the people are porting and we are getting more than 50 per cent share.

Bharti Airtel and Gulf Bridge International (GBI), a cloud provider for the West Asia and Europe, on Tuesday have agreed to unlock the capacity on GBI’s India-West Asia-Europe submarine cable system.
Under the agreement, Airtel will acquire the ownership of the India leg of GBI’s India-West Asia-Europe submarine cable. Airtel will also pick up a significant capacity on West Asia-Europe leg of GBI’s cable system, the company said.
Airtel and GBI have also agreed to formulate joint 'Go to Market' strategies and leverage the footprint of their respective global networks to serve global customers.
“With this, we are adding a large capacity to meet the growing data, content demand in markets like India as well as serve the connectivity needs of global carriers and enterprise customers. The agreement offers great synergies to Airtel and GBI as both partners will able to build on each other’s strengths in their respective markets,” Ajay Chitkara, Director and CEO for Global Voice and Data Business, Airtel said.
This will also complement Airtel’s existing global network spanning 2,50,000 Rkms (of networking cable) with presence in 50 countries and contribute to the company’s vision of serving customers with a future ready network that is built on cutting-edge technology, he said.
With this new investment, Airtel has further consolidated its leading position as a global capacity provider. It now has large capacities, owned and leased, on multiple international submarine cable systems and offers the maximum number of routes between India and Europe, the company said.
GBI’s cable asset will complement Airtel’s existing global network viz. IMEWE, EIG, SMW4 and MENA and add significant long term bandwidth capacity, enabling it to serve the booming data demand across emerging markets like India and Africa, it said.
GBI is a multilayer terrestrial and subsea cable meshed network bridges the East to the West through the West Asia, empowers businesses, connects societies and contributes to the region’s transformation towards knowledge-based economies.
“We are committed to build a sustainable network in partnership with global leaders, with an ultimate goal to offer the best user experience to our partners and end-users. In line with this objective, today, we are excited to onboard Airtel and together deliver greater value to customers,” Abdulla Al Rwaili, Executive Vice Chairman and Managing Director, GBI, said."
215,2018-03-08,Airtel,"Telecom stocks rise on relief measures for sector 
 Telecom stocks gained as much as 4 per cent in morning trade after the Cabinet approved relief measures for the financially stressed sector. The Cabinet yesterday allowed telcos to pay for spectrum over 16 years instead of 10 years and permitted them to hold more airwaves.
It also relaxed caps on holding spectrum, helping ongoing mergers like that between Vodafone and Idea as the combined entity would have breached the current limits in certain circles or telecom zones.
Reacting to the development, shares of Bharti Airtel spurted 2.62 per cent to an intra-day high of Rs 414, while Idea Cellular jumped 4.39 per cent to an early high of Rs 83.10 on the BSE.
The S&P BSE Telecom index also went up by 2.04 per cent to a high of 1,378.50 in morning trade.
The spectrum cap relaxation would also help billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio to acquire the spectrum of Reliance Communications in certain bands.
The decision of the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi came after a majority of telecom companies flagged their concerns over severe financial stress facing the sector due to intense competition unleashed by Reliance Jio’s rock-bottom tariffs."

 The Reserve Bank has imposed a penalty of ₹5 crore on Airtel Payments Bank for violating operating guidelines and Know Your Customer (KYC) norms.
 The fine was imposed after RBI scrutinised the bank’s documents relating to opening of accounts without any specific or clear consent from the customers.
“The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed, on March 7, 2018, a monetary penalty of ₹50 million on Airtel Payments Bank Limited (the bank) for contravening the ‘Operating Guidelines for Payments Banks’ and directions issued by RBI on Know Your Customer (KYC) norms,” the central bank said in a statement.
 Based on the complaints and adverse media reports alleging that the bank had opened customer accounts without a clear/specific consent of the customers, RBI conducted a supervisory visit to the bank from November 20-22, 2017.
 According to reports, more than 23 lakh customers had reportedly received as many as ₹47 crore in their Airtel bank accounts, which they did not know had been opened.
 The supervisory visit report and other relevant documents, revealed contravention of ‘Operating Guidelines for Payments Banks’ and the directions issued by RBI on KYC norms, RBI said.
 Subsequently, RBI issued a show cause notice to the bank on January 15 saying why penalty should not be imposed for non-compliance with guidelines and directions issued by the central bank.
“After considering the bank’s reply and oral submissions made in the personal hearing, RBI came to the conclusion that the aforesaid charges of non-compliance with RBI guidelines/directions were substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty,” RBI said.
 It further said that the action was based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and was not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers.
 Airtel Payments Bank had commenced operations in January last year."

Bharti Airtel recently sold 20 per cent stake in Bharti Telemedia, its direct to home (DTH) arm, to private equity firm Warburg Pincus. The sale consideration for the deal was ₹1,624 crore. For Warburg Pincus, the stake buy gives it a foothold, through a key player, in the high-potential DTH market. Bharti Airtel, while still retaining 80 per cent in Bharti Telemedia, adds to its coffers amidst the ongoing telecom sector consolidation.
Bharti Telemedia’s DTH customer base increased from 27 lakh in March 2008 to 1.3 crore as of March 2017. Growth in average revenue per user (ARPU) has been stagnant, though, in recent times. In the September 2017 quarter, the ARPU stood at ₹233 compared with ₹232 in the year-ago period.

210,2018-03-19,Airtel,"DoT says no new bank guarantee from Axis Bank to be accepted 
 Telecom department has ordered that bank guarantees from Axis Bank should not be taken as the private sector lender had failed to honour a guarantee issued previously.
 The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in a March 16 office memorandum titled ‘non-adherence to contractual obligation of bank guarantees by Axis Bank’ said no new bank guarantee from the lender should be accepted.
 “Axis Bank has failed to invoke a Bank Guarantee issued by them on behalf of Aircel Group of Companies,” DoT said. “This action by Axis Bank is a serious breach of trust and contract with Government of India.” 
 Telecom companies have to routinely furnish bank guarantees to meet their contractual commitments. A failure may result in the government encashing the bank guarantee as a tool to punish the defaulter.
 Typically, a bank guarantee is issued by a bank or any other lending institution promising to make up for a pre-stated sum of money in case of default by the entity on whose behalf it is issued.
 When contacted, an Axis Bank official spokesperson, said: The bank guarantees have been issued by us on behalf of Bharti Airtel.” 
 Listing the reason for not honouring encashment of the bank guarantee, he said, “Payment of the said guarantees, at present, will be in violation of the orders of the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)“.
 Without giving details of the injunction passed or the matter before TDSAT, the spokesperson said: “Once the order is vacated, the bank will be pleased to honour the said guarantees, as per the underlying terms. This matter has been communicated to the Department of Telecom (DoT).” 
 A source who did not wish to be named explained that said bank guarantee was not issued for Aircel but rather Bharti Airtel, in a matter involving the use of Aircel’s spectrum by Bharti Airtel.
 The source said a TDSAT order on a dispute involving Aircel and Telecom Department prevented Axis Bank from making payments on the invoked bank guarantee.
 The order has to be vacated before Axis Bank can make the payment, the source pointed out.
 Meanwhile, the directive of DoT states that the action (failure by Axis Bank to invoke the said bank guarantee issued by them) is “a serious breach of trust and contract with Government of India.” 
“In view of this, you are hereby directed not to accept any new bank guarantee from Axis Bank, including renewals,” DoT added.
 The specific instructions by Department of Telecom (DoT) have gone out to all operators including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular, Reliance Jio Infocomm, Reliance Communications and Aircel amongst others. Multiple people confirmed receiving the said order."

 Bharti Airtel, the country’s largest mobile operator by subscribers, has agreed to modify a disclaimer accompanying its ‘season pass’ advertisement that is being aired during the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) series. The move follows a petition filed by Reliance Jio Infocomm before the Delhi High Court accused Airtel of misleading advertisements.
In its petition filed before the court, RJio accused Airtel of advertisements that “explicitly and falsely proclaim that the company is offering live and free access to Twenty-Twenty (T20) cricket coverage”. 
Further, the ads “falsely” state that a subscriber need to obtain just a 4G SIM from Airtel and download Airtel TV app to obtain a virtual ‘season pass’ that provides live and free access to T20 coverage, petition added.
The advertisements, according to RJio’s petition, are “deliberately deceptive, misrepresenting and misleading in their content” as a subscriber will incur charges for data consumed to download or live stream the matches. The charges will be as per the data plan availed of by the subscriber and thus is not free. 
“A frivolous complaint was filed against Airtel’s new ad campaign in the Delhi High Court seeking a stay on the same. No stay was granted. In fact, the High Court has suggested minor clarifications to the existing disclaimers. After seeing the order we will take appropriate steps. Our ad campaign will continue,” an Airtel spokesperson said.
In its argument, Airtel counsels termed RJio as a “jealous competitor” and stated what was meant by ‘free subscription’ is free subscription of Hotstar network and whereas the advertisement specifically provides if one intends to watch the game one has to use data as per a user’s plan.
However, during the course of the arguments, Airtel counsel under instructions also agreed to add that the “subscription of Hotstar shall only be free and the data charges will be as per the subscriber’s tariff plan”."

Bharti Airtel topped the charts on 3G and 4G download speed, bettering rival Reliance Jio Infocomm, while the latter emerged as the best 4G service provider in the country.
“Airtel held onto our 3G and 4G speed awards.... It wrested our overall speed award away from RJio, locking down the top spot in all three of our speed categories. RJio, however, remained the closest contender in overall speed due to its high level of 4G access,” London-based OpenSignal, a company that specialises in wireless coverage mapping, said in a report.
During the tests, RJio delivered everyday download speeds of 5.1 Mbps, compared with Airtel’s 6 Mbps. RJio is “still far ahead” of key rivals in 4G availability, beating all three by at least 27 percentage points.
The tests were conducted between December 2017 and February 2018, and based on a 736,571-devices test.
“Our testers were able to find an LTE signal on RJio’s network 96.4 per cent of the time in our latest test period, up from 95.6 per cent in our October report,” it said.
“Such a score is exceptional, reflecting RJio’s commitment to build out a 4G-only network without 3G mobile data services to fall back on. What’s more, RJio’s impressive LTE reach is only improving, though incrementally. In our last India report in October, we measured RJio's 4G availability at 95.6 per cent,” it added.
While Airtel dominated in 4G speed nationally, Idea Cellular bested its larger competitor in both west and east Uttar Pradesh, while Vodafone India topped 4G speeds in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Both the operators were tied for first in LTE speed in several other regions such as Bihar, Kerala, Kolkata and West Bengal.
In its 18-circle 4G analysis, OpenSignal found several operators making their mark in particular States and regions with Airtel topping 4G speeds in 10 of the 18 circles the firm analysed.
The report, which stated that Indian operators were “hearing the call of 4G revolution”, had been recording substantial improvements in 4G availability in India during the last six months. This was because as operators have made access to LTE signals a new priority."
200,2018-04-24,Airtel,"Mobile division still weak for Airtel
In a quarter where Bharti Airtel was expected to report losses, the company beat market expectations and managed to record profits for the March period.
The tariff war unleashed by Reliance Jio, down-trading to cheaper data packages by customers and the regulator’s reduction of interconnect charges did take a toll on revenues and margins of Airtel though.
In the March quarter, the company’s revenues fell 10 per cent over the same period in the previous fiscal, while net profit declined by 78 per cent. Its operating free cash flow (EBITDA-Capex) and interest coverage appear strained.
Airtel’s DTH and business services divisions (together accounting for a fourth of overall revenues) though had a reasonably smooth run as revenues from these divisions increased 9-11 per cent y-o-y.








 
 
For Airtel, the average revenue per user decreased by over 26 per cent y-o-y and nearly 6 per cent sequentially to ₹ 116, as lower tariffs and the trend of customers seeking to move out from costlier data packages to more attractive lower-cost options played out.
Operating free cash flow was down a whopping 82 per cent in the March quarter to ₹751.7 crore, as EBITDA fell and capex increased. Airtel’s interest coverage too has been coming down steadily and was at little over four times for the period, which by itself is reasonable, though the declining trend may be a cause for concern.
But it may not be all gloom and doom for the company.
For one, the telecom industry has consolidated to a 3-4 player market. The amount of data used per customer has increased nearly four-fold over the last one year to around 6.6GB for the company. Airtel’s subscriber base is healthy and has grown at over 11 per cent in y-o-y, even during the heavy competition phase.
So, when the hyper competition on tariff gradually subsides, pricing power should return over the next year or so.
The healthy performances of its DTH and B2B divisions may add to its top-line and margins.
For the near term, markets will cheer the fact that the relatively lower expectations were exceeded by the company."

   -  REUTERS


 In a breather to Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone India, the Telecom Disputes Settlement & Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) on Tuesday stayed the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI’s) latest order related to revised ‘significant market power’ definition and reporting requirement on segmented offers. 
TRAI in February had said that operators with significant market power (SMP) cannot offer below cost tariffs even as it changed the definition of what constitutes SMP. 
TRAI order of February had changed the definition of SMP. According to its earlier definition of SMP, a player was considered dominant if it crossed 30 per cent threshold by number of subscribers, revenue market share, volume of traffic and network capacity in any circle. But it was changed to only ‘…30 per cent threshold by subscriber or revenue market share in any circle’.
A segmented offer is a tariff which contains special offers that include discounts/ concessions, which operators provide to retain customers, generally who are high ARPU customers.
“The clauses in the impugned order related to the reporting requirement and definition of significant market power are stayed. However, respondent will be entitled to ask for details of segmented discounts/ concessions for analysis but no penalty shall be imposed on that basis until further orders in these pending appeals,” the TDSAT order seen by BusinessLine said. 
The Tribunal in the order said the companies need not disclose names of any customer and if there is any other sensitive information which they feel would affect their business interests, they would be at liberty to withhold such information but, offer a written explanation for such withholding to TRAI.
“If the respondent (TRAI) feels that relevant and necessary information is being withheld without just and good reasons, the matter may be bought to the notice of the Tribunal for appropriate directions,” the order added.
TRAI in February had announced that the amendments made to Telecommunications Tariff Order (TTO), stipulates that no operator shall in any manner discriminate between subscribers of the same class and such classification of the subscribers shall not be arbitrary. It had also defined predatory pricing and had amended the definition of ascertaining an SMP.
Predatory pricing
However, Airtel and Idea Cellular had moved the TDSAT alleging that TRAI’s latest regulations on predatory pricing have ‘significant implications’ for the sector and will also impact customer interest.
The TDSAT, on March 5, had heard the appeals of both the companies, but did not grant a stay on the amendments to the TTO, as urged by the operators. However, it had directed TRAI to file its response within four weeks, after which the two operators were provided three weeks to respond to the TRAI’s response. 
On April 17, the Tribunal had reserved its interim order on the petitions filed by Airtel and Idea Cellular, when both the companies got a small window of relief, as they did not have to comply with TRAI’s direction on reporting segmented offers."

He, however, maintained that Airtel continued to consolidate its leadership position quarter under review. The company’s strategic investments in data capacities, innovative digital content through Airtel TV, customer-friendly bundles and upgrade programmes led to the highest ever mobile data customer additions of 15 million during the quarter, he added. 
“Usage parameters remained robust – on a year on year basis, we saw data and voice traffic grow 584 per cent and 55 per cent, respectively. We have ended the financial year with our highest ever capital expenditure of ₹24,000 crore. We intend to continue the rollout momentum next year as well,” Vittal added. As on March 31, the company had 304.2 million GSM customers in India as compared to 273.6 million in previous year, an increase of 11 per cent. 
The company had 86.1 million data customers as on March 31, a growth of 50 per cent as compared to 57.4 million at the end of the previous year. 
Final dividend
Meanwhile, the board of Airtel has recommended a final dividend for financial year 2017-18 of ₹2.50 per equity share (face value ₹ 5 each), subject to the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, it said.

 Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular (along with its subsidiary ABTL, “Idea Group”) and Vodafone Group on Wednesday said that they have agreed to merge Vodafone’s, Idea Group’s and Providence Equity Partners’ respective shareholdings in Indus Towers Ltd (“Indus Towers”) into Bharti Infratel creating a combined company that will own 100 per cent of Indus Towers.
The combination of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers by way of merger will create a pan-India tower company, with over 1.63 lakh towers, operating across all 22 telecom service areas in India. The combined company will be the largest tower company in the world outside China.
Pro forma for the transaction, the combined company’s equity value would be Rs. 6,500 crore.
The final number of shares issued to Vodafone and the cash paid or shares issued to Idea Group and Providence, will be subject to closing adjustments, including but not limited to movements in net debt and working capital for Bharti Infratel and Indus Tower, Airtel said in a statement.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone will jointly control the combined company, in accordance with the terms of a new shareholders’ agreement, it said.
Indus Towers is currently jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42 per cent), Vodafone (42 per cent), Idea Group (11.15 per cent) and Providence (4.85 per cent).
The transaction will be structured as -- Indus Towers will be merged with into Bharti Infratel through a scheme of arrangement; the merger ratio of 1,565 shares of Bharti Infratel for every one Indus Towers share is within the range recommended by the independent valuer. 
Based on the SEBI pricing guidelines for Bharti Infratel, in relation to the proposed scheme, as of April 23 (Rs. 363 per share), the merger ratio implies an enterprise value for Indus Towers of Rs 71,500 crore. 
It is intended that Idea Group will sell its 11.15 per cent shareholding for cash concurrent with completion of the scheme, the company said."

The company’s Q4 profit plunged 77.8 per cent to Rs 82.9 crore ($12.43 million), hurt by continued pricing pressure in the telecoms sector after the entry of an upstart rival in 2016.


Shares of Bharti Airtel jumped as much as 4.71 per cent to 425.40, their highest in nearly a month, as Q4 metrics surprised analysts.
The stock was the top percentage gainer on the NSE index.
The company’s Q4 profit plunged 77.8 per cent to Rs 82.9 crore ($12.43 million), hurt by continued pricing pressure in the telecoms sector after the entry of an upstart rival in 2016.
Analysts, however, seem to be impressed with the company’s metrics. According to Nomura analysts, Q4 operating performance was resilient relative to expectations as mobile business metrics was not too bad.
The company has “solidly defended its market share and has the spectrum, capacity and willingness to invest,” UBS analysts said in a note, maintaining a target price of Rs 560 with rating “buy”. UBS had expected the mobile carrier to post Q4 loss of Rs 220 crore.
Stiff cost rationalisation across businesses helped the company avoid reporting net loss in the quarter, according to Kotak Institutional Equities.
Separately, the company also approved the merger of Indus Towers Ltd with its mobile masts operator unit Bharti Infratel Ltd, creating the largest tower company outside China by number of towers.
At least 24 of 31 brokerages have rated the stock “buy” or higher, four “hold” and three “sell” or lower; their median target price is Rs 560. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock was down 23.3 per cent this year."
197,2018-04-25,Airtel,"Will evaluate strategic stake sale post completion of tower co merger: Airtel 
 Bharti Airtel today said it will engage with potential investors to evaluate a strategic stake sale in the new tower company, after the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers is completed.
 Earlier today, Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone Group announced the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel to create a mobile tower juggernaut with over 1,63,000 towers across 22 telecom service areas.
 The combined company, which will fully own the respective businesses of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, will change its name to Indus Towers and will continue to be listed on the Indian stock exchanges.
 In a BSE filing today, Bharti Airtel said its board was presented with two options with regard to its stake in subsidiary Bharti Infratel and after due consideration it decided to approve the proposal for merger of Indus Towers into Bharti Infratel. “The board decided to engage with the potential investors for evaluating a strategic stake sale post the completion of merger,” Airtel added.
Sale in the offing?
 Merger was one of the options placed before the board. The other was an offer for sale of significant stake in Bharti Infratel from a consortium of leading Private Equity investors, which was not perused at this point.
 Indus Towers is jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42 per cent holding), Vodafone (42 per cent), Idea Group (11.15 per cent) and Providence (4.85 per cent). Post the deal, Airtel and Vodafone will jointly control the combined company and the transaction is expected to close before the end of 2018-19, subject to statutory approvals.
 As per the contours of the deal announced today, Vodafone will be issued 783.1 million new shares in the merged entity in exchange for its 42 per cent stake in Indus Towers, and this could take its holding to 29.4 per cent in the new company depending on whether Idea and Providence decide to sell their holding for cash consideration.
 Similarly Airtel’s stake in new combined tower behemoth may be diluted to 37.2 per cent in combined entity from 53.5 per cent it holds in Bharti Infratel."
196,2018-04-27,Airtel,"Airtel rating may be downgraded if margins dip further: Moody’s 
 Telecom major Bharti Airtel may face a rating downgrade in the next 6-12 months if intense competition remains in the market and decreases its margins, Moody’s Investors Service said while affirming the Baa3 ratings with negative outlook to the company.
“The ratings are likely to be downgraded within the next 6-12 months if heightened competition persists in its Indian wireless business, such that consolidated EBITDA or margins deteriorate further from current levels,” Moody’s said in a statement. 
 Moody’s Investors Service has affirmed Bharti Airtel’s (Bharti) Baa3 issuer rating and senior unsecured debt ratings, as well as the Baa3 ratings on the senior unsecured notes issued by Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V., which are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Bharti. 
“The outlook on the ratings is negative,” the report said. Credit ratings reflect an organisation’s ability to repay debt. The Baa3 rating means the entity is medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and has an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations.
“The affirmation of Bharti’s Baa3 rating and negative outlook recognises that the company’s leverage metrics remain elevated as profitability continues to be under pressure,” Moody’s Vice President and Senior Credit Officer, Annalisa Di Chiara said. The negative outlook reflects the company’s high leverage levels with the adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 3.8 times on a consolidated basis at year-end March 2018.
The consolidated net debt of Airtel increased to Rs 95,228 crore at the end of March 2018, from Rs 91,714 crore at the end of December 2017. 
The country’s largest mobile operator Bharti Airtel reported its lowest quarterly consolidated net profit in at least 14 years, as competition with free voice calls and dirt-cheap data tariffs from new entrant Reliance Jio ate into its margins.
Airtel posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 82.9 crore (or 21 paisa per share) in the January-March quarter of 2017-18 fiscal as compared to Rs 373.4 crore (or 93 paisa a share) in the same period of the previous fiscal. Airtel’s total revenue fell by 10.5 per cent to Rs 19,634 crore in the fourth quarter of 2017-18. For the full fiscal year that ended in March 2018, Airtel’s net profit came in at Rs 1,099 crore, over 71 per cent lower than the Rs 3,800 crore logged in FY 2016-17.
“To that end, we believe the recently announced merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers provides a path for significant debt reduction with the possibility of an eventual sale of its stake in a larger business over the next 12-15 months,” Di Chiara said. Bharti is expected to have a 33.8-37.2 per cent stake in Indus Towers following the merger, Moody’s said. 
“Based on the company’s announcement, the equity value of the combined entity is estimated at $14.6 billion, making Bharti’s stake worth around $4.9-5.4 billion, and thus providing significant potential for debt reduction within the next 12-15 months,” the report said. Moody’s expects that with an improvement in the financial position of the African operations, Bharti will consider options to monetise a part of its stake in that operation as it focuses on measures to reduce consolidated leverage."

Shares of Idea fell as much as 8.1 per cent to their lowest since February 2011, while Airtel declined about 5.8 per cent.
Reliance Jio's entry into the telecoms sector has set off a brutal price war among operators as they drastically cut prices to compete with Jio's bottomed-out plans.
For the top three big telecom operators in India, post-paid users make up only 7 per cent of the total subscribers, but contribute more than 20 per cent to their revenues, says Jefferies.
Airtel and Idea are expected to launch new plans in response to Jio's offer and thus see a further decline in their average revenue per user, it adds.
Any 10 percent cut in post-paid prices will lead to an EBITDA decline of 12 per cent and 6 per cent for Idea and Airtel, respectively, the brokerage adds.

Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio) has accused Bharti Airtel of “gross and blatant violation” of licence conditions while launching Apple Watch Series 3, a move that further intensifies the rivalry between the two telecom companies. In April, RJio had moved the Delhi High Court accusing Airtel of misleading advertisements during on the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) series.
In the latest face-off, RJio has shot off a letter to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) asking it to direct Airtel to “immediately stop this service”. The letter, a copy of which was reviewed by BusinessLine, also termed the services of violating security conditions.
Airtel, in an e-mail response, said it as another “frivolous complaint by a desperate operator” and added that Airtel is a law- abiding and responsible operator.
RJio, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries, said Airtel has not set up an eSIM provisioning node — a critical network element which contains important network and user information — in India. 
Airtel’s current node, which is located out of India, is a gross violation to the licence terms, it added.
“Airtel has deliberately chosen to install a critical network element outside India for a service being offered under the Access Services Licence and this indicates its blatant disregard for the sanctity of the licence terms and conditions, including important security conditions,” the letter said.
Further, Airtel should have carried out Legal Interception and Monitoring (LIM) prior to service launch so that important national security interests are not compromised in any manner.
“We are neither aware whether Airtel has made necessary changes in its LIM solution nor if it has offered this service for LIM demonstration to the DT and security agencies,” it added.
Responding to RJio’s allegations, Airtel said, “The DoT was duly notified prior to the launch of Apple watch, including product features, network architecture and lawful interception and we have also requested them to carry out a demonstration of the same” .
“All information relating to customers, network nodes etc is hosted in a fully secure manner by Airtel India along with provision for lawful interception. We will be happy to share more details with the DoT as and when required,” it added."

Airtel had announced the acquisition of Telenor’s spectrum in February last year. All existing customers of Telenor India will now become a part of India’s largest mobile network and will get world-class services – high speed data, voice and content — at affordable prices, Airtel said. 
The company will add 5MHz to 7.2 MHz of Telenor’s spectrum (1800 band) in each of the seven circles. The addition of this fresh spectrum (total of 43.4 MHz) will enable Airtel to further expand network capacity across these markets.

The acquisition consolidates our market leadership, further strengthens our network portfolio in key markets, and will add to shareholder value,” Gopal Vittal, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (India & South Asia), said.

The Supreme Court had last week rejected DoT’s petition for security deposit of around ₹1,700 crore from the companies and directed it to approve the merger. The guarantee included ₹1,499 crore for one-time spectrum charge for the radiowaves allocated to Airtel without auction, and over ₹200 crore for spectrum payment, which Telenor has to make.

Fitch says the rating reflects Bharti Airtel’s diversified and integrated business profile.
   -  Reuters


 International rating agency Fitch today retained its ratings on Bharti Airtel at BBB- along with a stable outlook, citing the unlikelihood of a further drop in tariffs coupled with its rising non-telecom revenue streams.
The agency has a BBB- ratings on Bharti’s long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating along with a BBB- ratings on the bonds issued by its subsidiary Bharti Airtel International Netherlands.
It said the rating reflects Bharti’s diversified and integrated business profile, with operations spanning mobile, fixed-line, digital TV, telecom tower and enterprise sectors in the home market along with mobile operations in Sri Lanka and 14 African markets. “Bharti will increase its home market mobile revenue market share to 35-36 per cent, on completion of its acquisition of Tata Tele, despite high competitive intensity,” Fitch said.
The agency, however, was quick to add that “any further increase in competitive intensity could weigh on its ratings, as it has low rating headroom.” It can be noted that once the merger of Vodafone and Idea happens, Bharti will be pushed to the No 2 slot both in terms of revenue and number of subscribers.
“The stable outlook reflects our belief that revenue from Bharti’s home market mobile segment may recover on higher data volume and its African and enterprise business segments will continue to expand. We believe telecom tariff levels in the country are unsustainable in the medium- to long-term in light of the low return on investment for telcos,” Fitch said.
On the solid revenue stream of the company, the report noted that the operating revenue contribution from its African and non-mobile businesses in the home market has steadily increased to 22 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively, in FY18, from 15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, in FY17.
But it was soon to add that already highly leveraged Bharti has not only has a lower rating headroom but also it will decline further with a leverage of 2.1-2.3x in FY19 from 2x, excluding USD 6.5 billion deferred spectrum costs in FY18.
Fitch has forecast that both revenue as well as operating profit will remain flat on sustained competition, and ruled out any tariff hikes on the aggressive play by Reliance Jio which will remain aggressively competitive and will prevent any meaningful rise in industry tariffs.
Given this, Bharti’s revenue is likely to increase by 1-2 per cent in FY19, driven by a growth in digital TV, tower and enterprise business segments, the agency said. The operating margin will remain stable at 34-35 per cent, down 100 bps from FY18 as there is no incremental competition in the mobile segment, it added."

The combined company will own 100 per cent of Indus Towers. Indus Towers is currently jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42 per cent holding), Vodafone (42 per cent), Idea Group (11.15 per cent) and Providence (4.85 per cent).
Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone Group in April had announced an agreement for the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel to create the largest mobile tower operator in the world outside China with over 1.63 lakh towers across 22 telecom service areas.
“…approval of Competition Commission of India has been received for the proposed merger of Bharti Infratel Ltd and Indus Towers Ltd,” Bharti Infratel said in a regulatory filing.
As per the deal, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone will jointly control the combined company, and the transaction is expected to close before the end of 2018-19, subject to statutory approvals.

Gopal Vittal, Airtel Managing Director and CEO, in New Delhi
   -  Kamal Narang


 Bharti Airtel is leaving no stone unturned to give better services to the customers by simplifying its businesses. 
The company said even though the industry has changed a lot and average revenue per user (ARPU) has also come down a lot, post the launch of Reliance Jio, the market is sustainable and ideal for the players to survive, a top official at Airtel said. 
“In a market of 1.3 billion people, three private operators (Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and RJio) and a government player (BSNL) to serve them, is a very sustainable and ideal structure. In terms of relative position of players, you have Vodafone-Idea which will have 39-40 per cent market share, us 33 per cent (including Tata and Telenor share) and RJio about 20 per cent market share,” Gopal Vittal, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (India and South Asia), Bharti Airtel, told BusinessLine.
He said in future, there will be three equal-sized or similar level of market share of these large players. “We are quite relaxed about that because we think that the primary thing to sustain is to realise ‘Digital India’ and we are here to make sure that we grow market share profitably and sustainable,” he said. 
Vittal said now is not the time to make strategies to become No.1 or No.2 player, but a strategy on how to retain customers and make more profitable and sustainable business. 
Upbeat on data usage
“We have been in some financial spin in the last 12-18 months…we have seen ARPUs crashing down and pricing erode. But, I look at the positive side. For example, last year, on an average, people who spent 190 minutes every day with their device are spending 240 minutes today. So it is a good thing for us,” he explained.
That is why it is exciting time for the company because in a market of three players, and 1.3 billion customers, the device has become a centre and that is why also the company is tying up with content providers. For instance, Netflix, Amazon and Symantec (for cyber security).
The company is also investing a lot to expand its network and technologies. In 2016, the company spent ₹16,000 crore on capex, last year increased by 50 per cent to ₹24,000 crore investment and this year again ₹24,000 crore, Vittal said. “By March 2019, we would have invested ₹2,70,000 crore on capex and network plus spectrum. Now, we have tripled our tower and massively increased our fibre on ground,” he said.
On asked about call drops and slow network at some places, Vittal said, “All the operators are in the same situation right now. But, one of the things we are looking at is re-farming some of our spectrum also. For example, 3G as a technology will die-out soon and the 3G spectrum needs to be re-farmed to 4G.”
However, he said 2G will remain because there are devices at ₹300-400 for the low-end consumers and that is important and somebody has to serve them.
Software upgrade
On improving of network, the company also looking at a lot of upgrades in the software. “Our data have gone almost 26 fold in the last 18-20 months, so keeping pace with that has led to a lot of congestion and the reason for capex going up so much is because of all these,” he quipped. 
On Internet telephony and its impact, Vittal said that whether one uses them as a traditional call or use it over a VOIP, it really doesn’t matter because now we are getting a certain amount of ARPU.
On 5G and its progress, Vittal added that the use cases have to develop in India and right now the talks are only surrounding around driverless cars and robotic surgery. 
“We think India should be in the forefront of the technology and come with the rest of the world. We are also working on how we can develop more use cases and we will welcome the auction (spectrum) as and when it happens,” he added."

 Airtel Payments Bank today said it has received requisite approvals from the Reserve Bank to begin taking new customers.
 Also, Aadhaar-issuing authority UIDAI has allowed it to use the 12-digit unique identification number-based e-KYC, it said in a statement.
The development comes nearly seven months after Airtel along with Airtel Payments Bank came under fire for allegedly opening payments bank accounts of its mobile subscribers without their consent, and LPG subsidy worth crores was deposited into these accounts.
 RBI thereafter had directed Airtel Payments Bank not to on-board new customers while Aadhaar-issuing body UIDAI had suspended the e-KYC licence of both Airtel and the payments bank. 
The company had denied any wrong doing and streamlined its processes to comply with the regulations.
 UIDAI, in March this year, restored Airtel’s authorisation to conduct Aadhaar-based verification of its mobile subscribers, but did not lift the suspension on its payments banks’ e-KYC licence.
“Airtel Payments Bank has received requisite approvals from the Reserve Bank of India to start on-boarding new customers,” the statement said. “Airtel Payments Bank has also been permitted by the UIDAI to resume the on-boarding of customers using Aadhaar based e-KYC. We thank the authorities for the approvals,” it added.
 Airtel Payments Bank, it said, remains committed to the government’s vision of financial inclusion and banking for all.
 A payments bank is like any other bank, but operates on a smaller scale without involving any credit risk.It can accept deposits of up to Rs 1 lakh, offer remittance services, mobile payments/transfers/purchases and other banking services like ATM/debit cards, net banking and third party fund transfers but cannot advance loans or issue credit cards."

The stock gained as much as 4.5 per cent to Rs 373.90, highest since July 3.
Airtel shares gained as the net profit beat analyst estimates. Bharti Airtel’s capex intensity will remain elevated, requiring it to exit Infratel post-merger and infuse more money into its wireless unit, says Ambit Capital.
Of 30 brokerages covering the stock, 22 rate it “buy” or higher, four “hold” and four “sell” or lower; their median price target is Rs 500, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.
The stock was the fourth-largest contributor to NSE and BSE indexes.

168,2018-07-27,Airtel,"Intense competition in the sector continues to hurt Airtel at home


In reporting a negative profit-before-tax figure, Bharti Airtel’s challenges in its domestic mobile operations only seem to have increased in the June quarter.
Overall revenues fell 9 per cent YoY during the first quarter. The company would have reported a net loss, but for the creation of deferred tax asset in its Nigerian operations to the tune of ₹515.6 crore. The Profit before tax, a more representative figure, was a negative ₹285 crore (in other words, a loss).
Clearly, Reliance Jio’s tariff war is continuing to take a heavy toll on even the large surviving incumbent operators’ financials, with no signs of immediate recovery. The positives for Airtel in the quarter were the steady performance of its DTH business and its B2B services segment.
Mobile operations weak
Airtel’s domestic mobile operations were weak, with the revenues from the segment declining by nearly 19 per cent. The average revenue per user continued to decline and fell nearly 32 per cent YOY in the June period, to ₹105.
Thanks mostly to the integration of Telenor, Airtel had robust subscriber addition of 40 million during the period. Average data consumption per user was up three-fold to nearly 7.9GB in the June quarter.
The Idea-Vodafone merger is set to take place next month. Jio continues to compete on tariffs and is also set to launch its post-paid option as well. Clearly, the competitive intensity is not going to abate for the foreseeable future as operators try to poach subscribers from one another. For Airtel, the silver lining was visible in its African operations, with revenues from the geography increasing at a healthy pace.
Other businesses shine
Airtel’s DTH segment(7 per cent of revenues) continues to grow in double digits, with revenues increasing by 11 per cent YOY in the June quarter. Subscriber addition, at 4.8 lakh, was robust. The ARPU from the segment(₹229) too was largely stable.
Revenues from the B2B business(20 per cent of revenues), which is mainly focussed on providing connectivity to corporates, rose 7 per cent YoY.
As one of the three strongest entities left in the mobile arena, Airtel may still weather the storm on tariffs and competition. But it would be a few more quarters before the company gets to deliver reasonable bottom-line figures. Till such time, the African operations and the non-mobile business would have to chip in to shore up profitability."

SAMEER BATRA, CEO, Wynk




SAMEER BATRA, CEO, Wynk


With smartphones doubling up as entertainment devices, Bharti Airtel is going all out to ensure its customers remain glued to the mobile screen. BusinessLine caught up with Sameer Batra, CEO of Airtel’s Wynk Ltd, to understand what the operator is doing to boost customer stickiness. Excerpts:
Why is content gaining importance in ensuring customer stickiness?
A couple of changes have happened in the ecosystem. One is data is far more affordable and that should increase the elasticity of consumption. A lot more smartphones are proliferating the market. And 4G networks have expanded rapidly. So, the environment is very conducive for content. If you are able to engage people deeply with more digital services from the same brand, chances of stickiness are dramatically impacted. We are seeing a strong correlation between content and the ability to stick to an existing service provider.
What is Airtel doing to improve its content offerings?
We are forging a lot of partnerships, both audio and video. We have about 4 million songs on audio and they come from good partnerships with both national and regional labels. On the video side, we have partnerships with broadcasters and content catalogues such as Eros, ALTBalaji, Zee and SonyLiv.
How will Airtel differentiate itself? Will you look at original content creation?
One way is to start creating content for our platform. But we are staying away from that because we feel it is more important to solve the personalisation issue — how can we curate and throw up recommendations on what you should be watching depending on who you are as a consumer. The second way is to go deeper. We are creating a lot of regional partnerships.
There are a lot of regional players who have not found a platform to market or distribute their content. We are tying up with them.
Is acquiring stakes in content companies also on the agenda?
It is something we fundamentally don’t believe in. Our model has been partnership and we don’t want to control the value chain. Our philosophy has been partnering — be it for IT or networks — and we are clear about what we are good at. We are good at understanding customers, technology, distribution and marketing.
And then there are people who have a good understanding of what content can sell, what format it should be — whether it should be scripted, whether it shoudl be fiction or non-fiction.
If we can find a common ground to work on and add to each other’s business objectives, it is the way to go.
What if some content companies forge exclusive tie-ups with another operator, leaving out Airtel?
Content companies need scale, too, and nobody can commit to working with only one player. You would want an international audience and partner with an operator whose customers can pay for content. We have good, high value customers and given that we were early entrants in the market, the ability of our customers to pay will be higher than others.
The market right now is building up. We would prefer to make sure that we have a stable platform and give personalised experiences and do this at a massive scale.
We want to get sharper about customer segments and needs. Right now, it is critical to make sure that customers fall in love with digital consumption vs live TV."

Bharti Airtel plans to spend ₹24,000–26,000 crore on capex this year across all major sectors, including mobile network sites, digitising network, fibre roll out and capacity building on information technology. 
Last year, the company invested around ₹23,000 crore, said its Chief Operating Officer Ajay Puri.
“It is an exciting time from the telecom perspective. We are in the midst of a journey to build a Digital Airtel, which is Airtel 3.0 that includes digital content, digital platform and digital services. We are also in the midst of hyper competition and consolidation in the market, and we have managed to sustain our leadership position,” he told newspersons. 
The market is consolidating, and has provided opportunity to expand both nationally and in Tamil Nadu. That’s the reason Airtel is investing in digital content, digital experience and starting to work on future technologies like Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. Airtel was first to test on 5G, he said.
Airtel will also take its fibre footprint in the State to 17,000 km in the next three years with the roll out of 3,000 km of new optical fibre.
Mobile sites
In 2018-19, Airtel will roll out 12,000 mobile sites across Tamil Nadu to add large network capacity and take high speed data services deeper into rural areas. This will translate into 32 new Airtel mobile sites going live every day across the State, which will add to a superior network experience for customers, he said.
On Fibre-To-Home, Puri said Airtel plans to roll out to another 10 million homes in the next two years and give customers speeds of 300 mbps to 1 gigabyte per second. The existing base is 8-9 million, he said. 
In Tamil Nadu, Airtel continues to lead the market with a share of 32 per cent with over 22 million customers. It has the largest network in the State with mobile broadband covering 95 per cent of the population. 
Airtel mobile services are present in 41,000 villages and over 1,100 cities and towns across Tamil Nadu, he said. “Nearly 50 per cent of all Aircel port-outs across Tamil Nadu came to Airtel,” he added."

Bharti Airtel (Airtel) on Monday said it was partnering with Telecom Egypt wherein, Airtel will get IRUs (Indefeasible Right of Use) on Middle East, North Africa Submarine Cable (MENA Cable) and TE North Cable Systems. 
In addition, Airtel will also take large capacities on a long-term basis on two new hi-tech Cable Systems (SMW5 & AAE1), the company said adding that the transactions are aimed to be concluded after the fulfilment of all conditions precedents.
With this, Airtel will be able to further diversify its global network to serve the growth in demand for data services, particularly in emerging markets across South Asia, Africa and Middle East, while also benefiting from the favourable economics of Telecom Egypt’s existing wide cable systems network, the company said.
Telecom Egypt is Egypt’s first integrated telecom operator, and the partnership grants Airtel the right to use fiber pairs of MENA Cable from Egypt to India with access to Saudi Arabia and Oman, and other fiber pairs from Egypt towards Italy.
It also extends beyond MENA Cable, where Airtel will get the right to use a fiber pair from Egypt to France on TE North along with capacities on SMW5 and AAE1 cable systems, it said.
“The partnership including MENA Cable and TE’s network will be a good addition to our global network portfolio and provide us with a high quality and diversified new route to Western Europe and the rest of the world,” Ajay Chitkara, Director and Chief Executive Officer – Airtel Business, said.
In particular, it will provide impetus to India’s emergence as a major regional Internet hub serving customers across SAARC region, with seamless global connectivity. he said.
Airtel’s global network portfolio includes ownership of i2i submarine cable system connecting Chennai to Singapore, consortium ownership of SMW4 submarine cable system connecting Chennai and Mumbai to Singapore and Europe, and new cable system investments like Asia America Gateway, India Middle East & Western Europe, Unity, EIG and East Africa Submarine System.
It also has terrestrial express connectivity to neighbouring countries including Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh and China."
164,2018-08-13,Airtel,"Incumbent telcos’ profit halved in 3 years: Crisil
Profits of the top three incumbent telecom firms—Airtel, Idea and Vodafone—have halved in the past three years with a 1,000 bps plunge in operating margins, and a recovery is seen only from FY20 when consolidation in the industry is complete, warns a report.
The corrosive effect of the competition, which began after Reliance Jio entered the fray in September 2016, will see gross revenue of the top three incumbents plunging by 14-16 per cent this financial year as they are forced to focus on retaining subscriber base, Crisil said in a report today.
Nonetheless, the industry is expected to see a 45 per cent growth in data volume, 3 per cent in subscribers, but a 18-20 per cent plunge in average revenue per user (Arpu) in FY19, it added. Industry revenue will continue to skid in FY19 as realisation will continue to head south.
“The battle unleashed by Jio has seen the industry’s gross revenue and adjusted gross revenue or AGR plummeting 10 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, in fiscal 2018, while their profit have halved in the past three years and the situation is expected to improve only after fiscal 2020, following completion of consolidation—the merger of Idea with Vodafone,” it warned.
Profitability is unlikely to improve this fiscal year too as margin is expected to contract further by 150-200 bps owing to the full-year impact of the IUC cut. Top three incumbents will see a sharper deterioration, said the report.
“Consolidated margin of the top three incumbents is expected to shrink by 250-300 bps due to increase in network operation cost and fall in Arpu as competition is no longer limited to prepaid, but entered the postpaid space too. Between fiscals 2016 and 2019, operating profit of the top three incumbents is likely to halve following a drop of 10 percentage drop in operating margins,” said the report.
Airtel’s operating margin has deteriorated the worst with a 1,100 bps drop in the past seven quarters.
Increased expenditure
The incumbents will also have to cough up Rs 75,000 crore on network capex this fiscal and the only breathing space they have is the relief in regulatory capex thanks to the increase in deferred payment period to 16 years from 10 and will be at Rs 16,500 crore this year.
The industry-wide debt is at Rs 3.5-3.7 trillion in fiscal 2018, of which over 50 per cent is with Airtel, Vodafone and Idea alone. The debt pile is expected to remain high in fiscal 2019 as cash headroom continues to drop as cash flow from operations of the top three incumbents is expected to shrink 3-5 per cent this fiscal, the report said.
These three have already announced plans to raise Rs 65,000 crore via bonds, debentures and loans in addition to them planning over Rs 16,500 crore through stake sale.
The only bright spots are low data tariffs and rising digital content consumption. In FY18 alone, data traffic grew four-fold. Availability of cheap 4G-enabled devices along with all-time low data tariffs are driving the shift in subscriber mix towards 4G. In all likelihood, data traffic in fiscal 2019 will increase 45 per cent despite a high base.
But what is more critical is that data realisation plummeted 95 per cent during the same period, leading to dual SIM declines, with smaller players shutting shop.
Price war
The intense price war began in September 2016 when Jio entered the market with almost free data and fully free voice which it ran for months, forcing others to follow suit and shows no signs of abating even after two years. “If anything, competition has become even more brutal, and the pain is expected to continue this fiscal as well.
Consequently, average gross revenue may decline another 6-8 per cent this fiscal as deterioration in realisation from data sales will continue. But data volume growth, expected at 45 per cent-which is fivefold jump from fiscal 2018, will limit the damage,” said the report.
The industry-wide realisation has been declining due to continued downward revision in tariffs more for the high end data users. As a result, average realisation per MB plummeted from 23 paise in fiscal 2016 to a mere 1.6 paise in fiscal 2018, it added.
“We see average realisation per MB falling further to 1.15-1.20 paise by this fiscal end because of the data pricing war led by Jio, which has been a net gainer following a cut in interconnect usage charges,” warned the report."

Bharti Airtel and Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) have joined hands to drive entertainment content on mobile phones. Zee will curate and create video content, including TV shows, original series and movies, exclusively for Airtel TV and its own digital platform, Zee5.
“There are several levels to the partnership. The exclusive piece is the content created and curated by Zee for Airtel.
“While it sits on the Airtel TV App, it plays from the Zee5 API. So, Zee will get access to that subscriber fully – from his profile to the consumption pattern,” Punit Goenka, MD and CEO, ZEEL, told BusinessLine.
Zee will use Airtel’s depth of data to understand consumer statistics and handpick content to suit that demographic. “However, Zee5 and our linear content are not exclusive and will be available for all our partners,” he added.
Revenue deal
Zee will get a fixed per subscriber fee with a backed-up minimum guarantee because of the upfront content investment it will pump in.
On its part, Airtel will bundle Zee5 with its ₹499 data pack under which the consumer will getaccess to the entire content of Zee5, including originals, movies, TV shows, music videos, plays, among others.
Gopal Vittal, MD and CEO (India and South Asia), Bharti Airtel, said: “We want to build a world-class content ecosystem by partnering all players and enabling a differentiated digital entertainment experience for our customers. In Airtel TV, we have built a solid digital platform to curate top content from India and across the world and offer it to customers at one place.”
He said Zee’s content catalogue was vast and varied, and Airtel’s collaboration would help unlock that potential. The partnership will be a win-win for both as it will help Zee ramp up its OTT subscription much faster than it could have done on its own as Airtel commands about a third of the Indian mobile subscriber market. Airtel, in turn, will get access to one of India’s biggest content libraries.
Airtel’s rival Reliance Jio has picked up stakes in Balaji Telefilms (25 per cent) and Eros besides Saavn as it looks to strengthen content offerings in a data-driven market."

 Bharti Airtel today said its DTH arm Bharti Telemedia has received the government’s approval for transfer of its 15 per cent stake to private equity firm Warburg Pincus. The said approval has been granted by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Airtel said in a regulatory filing.
“..Bharti Telemedia Ltd, a subsidiary of the company, has been granted the approval dated August 28, 2018, from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for transfer of its 15 per cent stake to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus,” Bharti Airtel said.
Under the deal announced in December 2017, Bharti Airtel had said it plans to sell 20 per cent stake in its DTH arm Bharti Telemedia to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus for about $350 million.
Of the 20 per cent, Bharti Airtel would sell its 15 per cent stake in the direct-to-home arm and the balance would be sold by another Bharti entity, which holds 5 per cent stake in the company.
Sources aware of the approval explained that while the filing only pertained to offloading of 15 per cent stake by the listed entity Bharti Airtel, the entire deal has received a clearance, including sale by separate Bharti entity.
The approval comes at a time when competition in the market has intensified -- Reliance Jio has already announced it will offer a set-top box for TV when it launches ultra-high speed fibre-based broadband services.
Market watchers have said Jio’s aggressive offerings will pose “serious competition” to TV distributors on both the direct-to-home (DTH) and cable side, putting further pressure on falling average revenue per user."

156,2018-09-08,Airtel,"Has India Inc.’s debt burden eased?
The last two to three years has been action-packed for India Inc. and banks, to say the least. While large corporates in key sectors have been busy shedding their unwieldy debt, banks have been untiringly spring-cleaning their stressed and bad loan accounts. The upshot: A leaner balance sheet for both India Inc. and banks.
The pace of debt accumulation had slowed down considerably in FY16 but is marginally inching up over the past two years. At the aggregate level, while the numbers look less daunting, is India Inc. really less indebted than before? Are the debt woes easing up for troubled sectors such as infrastructure, power, steel and telecom?
We dig into numbers of 1,197 NSE listed companies (for which data is available) to gauge how India Inc. is riding out the debt crisis. Here are our findings.
Debt accumulation slows……
Much of the origin of the NPA problem in banks and India Inc.’s indebtedness lies in decisions taken during the mid-2000s. With the Indian economy booming, companies lined up aggressive capex plans, financed by the credit boom. In a span of just three years, from FY05 to FY09, bank credit doubled. Loans continued to grow at a stellar pace even in the years following the 2008 global financial crisis.








 
Hence, to understand the big picture on India Inc.’s indebtedness, we break the aggregate data into three periods — FY10 to FY14 (fast pace of debt accumulation); FY14 to FY16 (slowdown in debt accretion); FY16 to FY18 (debt accretion inches up).
Between FY10 and FY14, the debt for the sample NSE listed companies grew by 21 per cent CAGR (compounded annual growth rate). The pace of debt accumulation was higher in core sectors such as infrastructure, power and telecom.
Between FY14 and FY16, however, debt accumulation slowed sizeably — growing by 4 per cent CAGR for the NSE listed companies.
For top borrowers such as Bharti Airtel, L&T, Adani Power, Bhushan Steel, Lanco Infratech, debt accretion slowed down drastically from over 30-40 per cent CAGR between FY10 and FY14 to lower teens and single-digits between FY14 and FY16. A few others such as Adani Enterprises had shed significant debt during this period.
…but inches up lately
In the last two years, debt accumulation has started to inch up slowly — though not at an alarming rate. Tapering off from seven-odd per cent growth in FY15, debt levels were flat in FY16. In FY17 though, debt levels for the 1,197 NSE listed companies grew by little over 4 per cent.
Data for FY18 is available only for 656 companies and, hence, may not be strictly comparable to numbers discussed for the earlier years. However, given that these companies have been constituting the chunk — about 70 per cent of the total debt — the underlying trend remains the same.
According to this data, for the 656 companies, after the aggregate debt remained flat in FY16, it grew by about 7.7 per cent in FY17 and 6.7 per cent in FY18. This implies that the pace of debt accretion in FY18 has been similar to that in FY17.
A sectoral and company-wise analysis of this debt trend is discussed later in the article.
Overall leverage moderates…
Even as Indian companies set out ambitious expansion plans in the boom years, the euphoria gave way to prolonged slowdown, and corporates with huge debt struggled to generate cash flows to meet interest payments. The debt-equity ratio for the NSE-listed companies went up from 0.7 times in FY10 to a little over 1 times in FY14, while their interest cover halved to 3.3 times (from six times in FY10).








 
In FY10, the number of companies that had debt-equity ratio of more than three was 93 (of the 1,197 listed companies). This number went up to 111 in FY14. Similarly, the number of companies with debt-equity of over five had doubled from 28 to 56 in this period.
The extent of over-leverage eased up somewhat in FY16, with number of companies with debt-equity ratio of more than three and five falling to 88 and 47 respectively.
A look at the numbers over the past two years suggests that, at an aggregate level, the leverage for India Inc. has moderated, with debt-to-equity at 0.9 times for 1,197 NSE companies in FY17 and 0.8 times for the 656 companies in FY18. Interest cover too, which continued to dip in FY16, bounced back to three times in FY17 (and four times for 656 companies in FY18).
… indebted firms on the rise
Even as the overall picture appears to have improved, more companies appear to have slipped into the highly-leveraged bucket between FY16 and FY18. Companies with debt-equity ratio of more than three and five inched up to 90 and 54 respectively in FY17; the smaller 656 companies list for FY18 also shows a significant jump in the number of over-leveraged companies vis-à-vis the previous year. 
Also, despite the pace of debt accumulation slowing in FY16, weaker companies have only turned weaker, evident from the increase in the number of companies with negative net worth. From a tally of 29 in FY10, the number of companies with negative net worth increased to 95 by FY17.
The companies with negative net worth included Lanco Infratech (as of September 2017); Era Infra Engineering (as of FY17); and GVK Power & Infra, MTNL, Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) as of FY18.
Lanco Infratech and Era Infra are among the first 12 companies referred to the NCLT. Recently, NCLT directed initiation of liquidation process for Lanco Infratech.
On the rise
As mentioned above, after debt accretion halted in FY16, there has been marginal pick up in the pace of debt increase over the past two years. A look at the top 50 borrowers’ accounts in the 1,197 NSE-listed sample, reveals that oil companies and refineries saw a significant increase in debt levels over the past two years.
IOCL, for instance, has seen its debt (includes long-term and short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt) creep up from about ₹58,000 crore in FY16 to around ₹65,000 crore in FY18. HPCL and Reliance Industries too saw debt go up notably in the past two years. But for most of these players, debt-equity is at best a little over one times and interest cover is comfortably at high single-digits or double-digits.
But increase in debt levels in other sectors and companies is not that comforting. Telecom, for instance, has seen debt continue to rise even during FY14 and FY16, when others were trimming their borrowings. The trend has continued over the past two years as well. Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular, and Reliance Communication — all have seen a steady rise in debt over the past few years.
For Idea Cellular, debt has increased from about ₹40,000 crore in FY16 to around ₹57,000 crore in FY18. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) recently approved the merger of Idea Cellular and Vodafone; the combined net debt of the new entity, as per the information provided by the company, is over ₹1 lakh crore as of June 2018.
Airtel’s consolidated debt figure is about ₹1.1 lakh crore as of FY18, while for Reliance Communications, it is over ₹45,000 crore. Interest cover is less than 1 to 1.5 times for these players. Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications made loss at the PBT (profit before tax) level in FY18.
Losing power
For few power companies, the debt has gone up steadily over the past two years. Tata Power’s debt, for instance, has gone up from about ₹40,000 crore in FY16 to around ₹48,500 crore in FY18. The company’s net debt/equity stood at 2.8 times in FY18. For Adani Power, while its debt has not gone up much over the past three years, at around ₹52,000 crore, debt levels are still worrisome. Debt-to-equity ratio is over 50 times for the company and interest cover is an abysmal 0.6 times.
Interestingly, for KSK Energy Ventures, a company with high debt-to-equity and low interest cover, its debt reduced drastically by over ₹20,000 crore in FY18, mainly due to de-consolidation and disposal of some of its subsidiaries/plants. Post the RBI February circular and lenders’ decision to consider the change in management outside NCLT, lenders have invoked shares in the company’s subsidiaries. De-recognising the related values of assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries has led to the sharp decrease in debt. The RBI’s February circular for stressed assets essentially did away with all the old restructuring schemes, and mandated banks to draw up resolution plans within 180 days, failing which they will have to refer the cases for insolvency under IBC.
The Allahabad High Court recently denied interim relief to power companies from the RBI’s February diktat. The worry is that a chunk of these stressed assets will now take the insolvency route. The structural issues plaguing the power sector — non-availability of fuel, projects set up without linkage, lack of PPA, tariff-related disputes — can make it difficult to find buyers under IBC, leading to liquidation.
But the Centre’s recent decision to warehouse stressed power projects under an asset reconstruction company under the -- Power Asset Revival through Warehousing and Rehabilitation (Pariwartan) -- scheme could offer some respite. This will ensure that the value of the assets is protected and will prevent their distress sale under IBC. How this will impact individual power companies needs to be seen.
What under IBC
While debt levels have not gone up over the past two to three years for construction companies, debt worries of companies such as HCC, Era Infra Engineering, Patel Engineering, Punj Llyod, JP Associates have been in focus. 
For HCC, lenders have implemented the S4A restructuring scheme (Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets). The RBI’s February circular has no direct impact, as the scheme is under implementation. However, this implies that all resolution plans which were under the process of finalisation under any of the earlier schemes — like the one for HCC’s subsidiary, Lavasa Corporation Limited — requires revision. Very recently, the NCLT admitted a plea filed by operational creditors who initiated the insolvency process against Lavasa under IBC. As the principal investor (68.7 per cent stake) in the project, it needs to be seen if HCC is able to find buyers for Lavasa under IBC.
Era Infra Engineering that owes lenders over ₹10,000 crore has been admitted for insolvency under IBC, and proceedings are yet to gain momentum. In the case of JP Associates, the Supreme Court recently allowed the RBI to direct banks to initiate insolvency proceedings against the company.
Within Infra, while the pace of debt accretion has slowed down considerably — even shrunk in a few cases — low interest cover and high debt-to-equity are a concern. Many of them are under resolution outside or under NCLT; still others may end up under NCLT, post the RBI’s February circular. 
GVK Power & Infra has over ₹12,000 crore of debt at the consolidated level, as of FY18. The company reported a loss in FY18 and has a negative net worth. In its notes to accounts, the company states that the loan balances of its subsidiary GVK Industries Ltd (GVKIL) and jointly-controlled entity, GVK Gautami Power Ltd (GVKGPL), has been classified as NPAs by lenders. It is working at a one-time settlement proposal with the lenders.
For GMR Infra, while the debt has come down substantially from ₹47,000 crore levels seen in FY15 to about ₹23,000 crore in FY18, debt-to-equity is still a worrisome 4-5 times and interest cover about 0.6 times. The debt pertaining to two of the company’s power plants — GMR Rajahmundry Energy and GMR Chhattisgarh Energy — was restructured under SDR, whereby the banks have converted part of their debt into equity and now hold a controlling majority in these companies. In view of the RBI’s February circular, reports suggest that resolution of these accounts is under way. It needs to be seen if these get referred to the NCLT. For IL&FS Transport, debt has been steadily rising and its debt-to-equity is over seven times in FY18.
The insolvency proceedings of Jaypee Infratech, which was admitted by the NCLT last year, was put on hold by the Supreme Court in the interest of home buyers. Very recently, the Supreme Court has directed re-commencing of the insolvency process.
The steel sector has been seeing a lot of action, with five out of 12 companies that were referred by the RBI to NCLT under the first list, being steel companies. Of these, three have seen successful resolution under IBC, which has led to substantial de-leveraging for the sector as a whole, even as banks have had to take huge haircuts.
Bhushan Steel, for instance, owed lenders about ₹56,000 crore. Tata Steel has taken over Bhushan Steel under the IBC process with a settlement amount of ₹35,200 crore (37 per cent haircut). 
Before the deal, Tata Steel’s gross debt, as of March 2018, stood at ₹92,147 crore. The company has taken an additional ₹16,413 crore debt to fund the takeover of Bhushan Steel. Hence, after other adjustments, the company’s gross debt stood at ₹116,615 crore as of June 2018.
In case of Electrosteel Steels too, the company owed lenders about ₹14,000 crore. Vedanta acquired control over Electrosteel Steels under IBC, paying a consideration of ₹5,320 crore, at a higher haircut of over 60 per cent. According to the company’s transcript, the net debt of Vedanta, as of June 2018, was at $10.7 billion, higher than $9.6 billion as of March 2018, primarily on account of acquisition of Electrosteel. 
For Monnet Ispat & Energy, a bid submitted by a consortium comprising AION Investments Private II Limited and JSW Steel Limited, has been approved, which entails a total consideration of about ₹2,800 crore against over ₹10,000 crore of dues owed by Monnet.
At an aggregate level, as more accounts get resolved under IBC, there could be significant de-leveraging for India Inc."

Aided by a sizeable deferred tax gain, telecom major Bharti Airtel on Thursday reported a consolidated net profit of ₹249.2 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2018.
The country’s second largest telecom network had recorded a consolidated net profit of ₹586 crore in the September quarter (July-September 2017) last fiscal. For the quarter under review, Bharti Airtel has recorded a deferred tax gain of ₹2,633 crore.
Total revenue for the quarter under review stood at ₹20,422.5 crore, up from ₹20,080 crore in the June quarter and ₹19,634.3 crore from the same period last fiscal.
The latest total revenue print was, however, lower than the total revenue of ₹21,777 crore recorded in the same September quarter last fiscal (July-September 2017).
For the half year ended September 30, Bharti Airtel’s net profit came at ₹728.8 crore, much lower than net profit of ₹1,203.8 crore.
The company reported a 2 per cent dip in India mobile service customer base during the quarter ending September 2018.
According to a statement to the exchanges, customers of Bharti Airtel’s India mobile services stood at 329,678 thousand. This stood at 336,274 thousand in the quarter ending June 30, 2018.
A company statement said, “Revenue from mobile services decreased by 16.3 per cent to ₹10,252.1 crore as compared to ₹12,245 crore in the corresponding quarter last year due to continued Average revenue per user (ARPU) contraction.
Overall ARPU for the quarter was ₹101 as compared to ₹142 in the corresponding quarter last year. The quarter has witnessed a reduction in rate of ARPU decline, owing to the high value customer retention initiatives implemented.”
However, traffic from India’s mobile services rose 1.6 per cent to 693,061 million minutes by September 2018 end over the same period.
A company statement said, “Mobile Data usage per customer witnessed an increase of 125.6 per cent to 9,221 MBs during the quarter as compared to 4,087 MBs in the corresponding quarter last year and has increased by 17.2 per cent compared to previous quarter.”
“Building data capacities and investing ahead of the data demand curve remains a key priority area. The capital expenditure for the quarter was ₹7,684.5 crore as compared to ₹7,483.8 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The consolidated operating free cash burn during the quarter was at ₹1,341.2 crore as compared to a positive cash flow of ₹519.9 crore in the corresponding quarter last year,” the statement said."

The country’s second largest telecom operator, Bharti Airtel was the fastest in terms of 4G download speed with 7.53 Mbps, followed by Reliance Jio at 5.47 Mbps and Vodafone 5.20 Mbps, a study by analytics firm OpenSignal said on Thursday.
State-owned BSNL was at the slowest with only 2.7 Mbps, it found out in the study conducted between June and August.
After Airtel, “the next three operators were fairly closely grouped, with less than 0.6 of a megabit separating Jio, Vodafone and Idea. And, this close grouping becomes more interesting when you examine the 4G-only download speeds for the three operators. Jio’s 4G download speed is the same as its download speed experience score, since it only operates on LTE,” it said in the report.








 
But, Vodafone and Idea’s 4G download speeds were faster than Jio’s. Despite Jio coming second in download speed experience, it fell behind the other two in 4G download (once their slower 3G download speeds were stripped out), it said.
Randeep Sekhon, Chief Technoloy Officer, Airtel said, “This latest report is yet another reaffirmation of Airtel’s obsession with network excellence. Our focus remains on building the fastest and the best network that enables a high quality digital experience for discerning customers who prefer network quality over deals and discounts.”
He said the company’s pace of deployment and investment has continued to pick up over the last 90 days. “This is allowing us to decisively win with 4G customers in the top 500 cities,” he added.
In terms of upload speed, Idea Cellular topped during the period, followed by Vodafone, Airtel and Jio. Open Signal claims that the analysis was done using over 10 billion measurements covering 1.7 million unique devices.
Meanwhile, the report also mentioned that Reliance Jio had the widest 4G coverage leaving behind its competitors with significant gap. “Jio swept the board in our 4G availability analysis, coming top in all 22 telecoms circles. The operator scored over 95 per cent in our 4G availability measurements in all regions, and topped 97 per cent in 10 of them. Jio’s average 4G availability score across all 22 circles we analysed was 96.7 per cent,” OpenSignal added."

 Bharti Airtel on Monday began rolling out, in select circles, an ‘alternate digital KYC process’ for new connections, to replace Aadhaar-based electronic verification, a company official said.
 The alternate digital KYC process has begun with select circles including Delhi, UP (East) and UP (West) and will be extended to other locations in the coming days, the official privy to the development told PTI.
 The alternate digital process for KYC entails scanning of the proof of address and identity, embedding live customer photo and online customer acquisition form, the source said adding that the entire process will be digital.
 The official further pointed out that the company will be phasing out the eKYC process, as the digital KYC system is rolled out to new locations, and stabilises. An email sent to Bharti Airtel in this regard remained unanswered.
 When contacted, a Vodafone Idea Ltd spokesperson confirmed that a new digital KYC process has been launched for onboarding customers across Vodafone and Idea brands but did not immediately offer specific details.
 On October 26, the telecom department had asked operators to stop using Aadhaar for electronic verification of existing mobile phone customers as well as for issuing new connections to comply with a recent Supreme Court order. The apex court had, last month, in a landmark verdict restricted the use of Aadhaar by private entities in the absence of a legal provision.
 The Department of Telecom in its October 26 circular had also taken note of the fact that the industry mooted an alternate process for KYC (know your customer) which entailed customer acquisition forms to be embedded with live photo of the subscriber and scanned images of proof of identity and proof of address, thereby digitising the end-to-end process for on-boarding of new mobile subscribers and making it paperless.
 Accordingly, all telecom service providers were asked by the DoT to ensure readiness of their systems and offer the proof of concept of the proposed digital process by November 5 for approval.
 The DoT had issued detailed instructions to telecom companies on stopping the use of Aadhaar-based e-KYC and report compliance by November 5."

 Telecom firm Bharti Airtel has sought to allay concerns of the Tanzanian government about the proposed listing of Airtel Africa Ltd, saying the planned IPO will not change the shareholding pattern of its unit in the African nation.
Amid reports that the Tanzanian government had raised objections to the ensuing initial public offering of Airtel Africa Ltd, Bharti Airtel issued a clarification asserting that the planned listing was, in no way, diluting the control of Airtel Tanzania.
“We have vide our separate communications to the Tanzanian Government clarified that the listing of shares of Airtel Africa limited will not change the shareholding or control of Airtel Tanzania or its parent company which holds shares in Airtel Tanzania i e Bharti Airtel Tanzania BV,” the company said in a regulatory filing.
Airtel would, even post IPO, continue to majority own Airtel Africa limited, UK and in turn the African operations, it added.
Airtel Africa limited, a UK incorporated subsidiary of Bharti Airtel Ltd, is intending to list its shares on an international stock exchange for funding the growth of its Africa businesses in 14 countries, including Tanzania, it said.

139,2018-11-08,Airtel,"Moody’s places Bharti Airtel’s rating on review for downgrade 
 Moody’s Investors Service Thursday placed Bharti Airtel’s rating on review for downgrade, following low levels of profitability and expectation of weak cash flow.
 Moody’s has placed on review for downgrade the ‘Baa3’ issuer and senior unsecured rating of Bharti Airtel and the ratings on the backed senior unsecured notes issued by Bharti’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B V, the US-based agency said in a statement.
 ‘Baa3’ is the lowest investment-grade bond ratings, and any downgrade would put the rating in speculative grade.
 “The review for downgrade is primarily driven by our expectation that Bharti’s cash flow generation will remain weak and leverage elevated,” Moody’s VP and Senior Credit Officer Annalisa DiChiara said.
 The review also reflects the company’s low levels of profitability, particularly from its core Indian mobile operations, negative free cash flow and higher debt levels to fund capital spending, it said.
 “Because we believe a more rational competitive environment in India’s telecommunications market is unlikely over the next 12-18 months, the review also reflects uncertainty as to whether the company’s profitability, cash flow situation and debt levels can improve sustainably and materially over the same period,” said DiChiara, who is also Moody’s lead analyst for Bharti.
 The review on Bharti’s rating will focus on the company’s commitments and plans to substantially reduce debt levels significantly over a short period of time; and plans to turnaround the underlying Indian mobile operations.
 While the majority of the USD 1.25 billion raised from the pre-IPO of its African business will be used to reduce debt, leverage will only improve marginally, Moody’s said.
 At the end of September, Bharti’s consolidated net debt rose to Rs 1.13 lakh crore, compared to Rs 1.02 lakh crore for the previous quarter.
 Moody’s views positively management’s plans to engage in further capital-raising activities - including asset sales - which aim to reduce debt levels significantly.
 “However, Bharti is becoming increasingly dependent on a significant turnaround of the underlying Indian operations to ensure a sustainable level of financial health supportive of an investment grade rating,” it said.
 Moody’s said the ratings could be downgraded if the company fails to use proceeds received from its recent pre-IPO of its African business or its proposed capital-raising activities for debt reduction.
 Moreover, any further deterioration in its operating performance, particularly in the Indian mobile segment, such that earnings and cash flows or revenue market share contracts from current levels, would also lead to a downgrade, the agency added.
 A bruising price war sparked by the entry of richest Indian Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio into the telecom sector with free voice calls and SMS bundled with cheap data has led to pressure on margins of incumbents, which have scrambled to match competition.
 Bharti Airtel recently reported a drop in consolidated net profit for the tenth straight quarter as losses on mainstay India business widened due to pricing pressure from aggressive competition.
 Overall, the consolidated net profit of Rs 118.8 crore in July-September represented a drop of about 65 per cent from Rs 343 crore in the year ago period.
 The loss from India operations (before exceptional items) mounted to Rs 1,646.4 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal compared to about Rs 940 crore in the preceding three-month period. The company had clocked a net income of Rs 649.4 crore in the July-September quarter of 2017."

 Shares of Bharti Airtel plummeted as Moody's placed the company under review for downgrade. The stock fell as much as 5.7 per cent to over one-week low of Rs 288.7.
Rating agency Moody's had on Thursday placed on review for downgrade the 'Baa3' issuer and senior unsecured rating of Bharti and the ratings on the backed senior unsecured notes issued by Bharti's unit Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V.
“The review for downgrade is primarily driven by our expectation that Bharti's cash flow generation will remain weak and leverage elevated,” Moody's said.
The rating agency said the review also reflects the company's low levels of profitability, particularly from its core Indian mobile operations, negative free cash flow and higher debt levels to fund capital spending.
“... we believe a more rational competitive environment in India's telecommunications market is unlikely over the next 12-18 months,” Moody's added.
Bharti Airtel stock was the top percentage loser on the NSE index, which was down 0.2 per cent as of 0410 GMT. About 2.6 million Bharti shares changed hands, vs their 30-day moving avg of 6.5 million shares. Up to last close, the stock had fallen 42.2 per cent this year."

 Bharti Airtel on Saturday said it will pre-pay $1.5 billion debt with its subsidiary Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands), using the proceeds it got from six global entities investing in its Africa unit.
 Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B V commenced cash purchase of $1.5 billion, 5.125 per cent Guaranteed Senior Notes which were due in 2023, Bharti Airtel said in a regulatory filing.
This offer, it said, has been made with a view to “pro-actively manage its capital structure, reduce gross debt and leverage by acquiring the Notes funded out of equity proceeds and also provide liquidity to Noteholders at a premium to the market.” 
Bharti Airtel group continues to deleverage and pursue its strategies towards that end, it added.
 “In line with this, it has been actively exploring various equity driven initiatives, including those previously announced regarding its Africa business, so as to pro-actively manage its balance sheet and capital structure to align them to the group’s core conservative philosophy,” it said.
 Bharti Airtel International’s (Netherlands) parent Airtel Africa Ltd, a UK incorporated subsidiary of Bharti Airtel Limited, recently made a successful primary equity issuance of $1.25 billion to six leading global investors, including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel, SoftBank Group and others.
“The proceeds of this equity issuance are intended to be used to reduce Airtel Africa’s existing debt of approximately $5 billion on the date of the announcement,” it said.
The proceeds of this equity issuance are now fully realised and available as cash. The company also carries organic cash on its balance sheet.
 “The company wishes to utilize the proceeds of this equity issuance and the cash available with it to reduce its existing debt by offering to purchase ‘any and all’ of the Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer.
 “Via the Tender Offer, the company is also providing liquidity to the Noteholders at a specified premium over the market price at launch,” the filing said.
 This offer is in addition to the previously announced tender offer cum repayment of EUR 1 billion 4 per cent notes maturing December 2018, for which funding has been drawn and available as cash with the company.

Intraday, shares of Bharti Airtel increased 9.97 per cent to Rs 332.9, while Vodafone Idea gained 8.02 per cent to Rs 37.7 on the BSE. Similar movement was seen on the NSE, wherein Bharti Airtel climbed 9.99 per cent to Rs 333.4, and Vodafone Idea advanced 8.02 per cent to Rs 37.7.
On Thursday, the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal had set aside the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's new norms on predatory pricing for lack of transparency in the guidelines over determining market share and rates of services.
The order provides the much-needed relief to operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea who had alleged that the rules were tailored for a new entrant.
TDSAT judgment comes as a major relief to Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea which had in March challenged the amendment made by TRAI to the telecommunication tariff order. TDSAT has ordered TRAI to rework the predatory pricing rule within six months.
It has also set aside a rule in TRAI predatory pricing regulation that required top telcos to report all tariffs in the interests of transparency and non-discrimination.

 Telecom operator Bharti Airtel and Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson on Friday claimed to have achieved broadband download speed of 500 Megabits per second (Mbps) on smartphones during live trial of a new technology. 
“During the trial, data download speeds of over 500 Mbps were recorded on smartphones in an indoor environment. In outdoor environment, peak download speed of more than 400 Mbps was achieved with coverage of about 180 meters from the base station. The trial was conducted in Delhi-NCR,” Airtel and Ericsson said in a joint statement. 
Both companies jointly conducted India’s first trial of Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) technology over a live 4G network. 
LAA is a key technology wherein operators evolve their networks to achieve gigabit LTE (4G) by opening up previously untapped resources of unlicensed spectrum delivering speeds once thought only possible over fiber.
LAA enables the use of unlicensed spectrum in the 5 GHz band in combination with the licensed spectrum.
“Airtel used one LTE 5 MHz carrier aggregated with three 20 MHz carriers of unlicensed spectrum. Together with 4CC carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256 QAM technologies, the trial was conducted using Ericsson Radio System,” the statement said.
Theoretically, a full high definition two-hour long video can be downloaded in about a minute and standard definition video in few seconds. 
Recently, the government freed around 550 Mhz of spectrum for public wifi and 5G services."
177,2018-12-24,Airtel,"Airtel to Ola: how brands face the social media minefield
What are you talking about?
Over the past two days, telecom service provider Airtel has been caught in the crossfire of social media outrage over the widespread perception that it yielded to a bigoted request from one of its customers.
 Even as of Wednesday morning, Airtel was on the back-foot over the issue: it put out a statement presenting its side of the matter, but the company’s experience serves as a teachable moment for brands as they navigate the social media minefield in these inflamed political times.
What exactly happened?
One of Airtel’s customers tweeted a service complaint, but when a customer service representative, Shoaib, to whom the complaint had randomly been assigned, responded, she put out a venomous tweet to Airtel saying she did not have faith in Shoaib because of his identity as someone from a religious minority, and asked that her case be reassigned to “a Hindu representative”. 
Whoa!
To ask that one’s case be reassigned to another representative on grounds of poor service may perhaps be justifiable. But this was religious bigotry at its worst, which has tragically become commonplace in recent times — and not just in India — particularly on social media platforms where unrestrained toxicity flows. 
And Airtel compounded it with its ham-handed response. 
What did it do?
Another customer care representative, with a name that may have perhaps been acceptable to the Islamophobic customer, stepped in to take forward the substance of her service complaint, but the optics of the whole episode — of a leading business brand seeming to capitulate to a bigoted customer — perturbed many on Twitter, who called for a consumer boycott of Airtel.
 Only hours later did the company respond to say that it does not discriminate among its customers or its employees on the basis of religion. But by then, the brand’s social goodwill had taken a serious knocking. 
How else could Airtel have responded?
There are plenty of other instances — in India and abroad — of brands standing firm against religious and racial bigotry even at the risk of losing customers. Cab aggregator Ola’s response in April 2018 in the face of a similar manifestation of Islamophobia among one of its customers was exemplary. 
Without missing a beat, Ola tweeted to say that like India, Ola is a secular platform, not given to discrimination on religious or other grounds, and further to urge customers and driver partners to “treat each other with respect”. There are many such ‘best practice’ examples overseas as well. 
Tell me more.
Just last year, famous brands, including web domain registrar GoDaddy and torch company Tiki turned down the patronage of white supremacist groups that used their products. Candy company Mars famously disavowed Donald Trump Jr’s unflattering comparison of their Skittles brand of candies to refugees. 
And more recently, JW Marriott Dubai ended its relationship with Michelin Star chef Atul Kochhar following his Twitter rant against Islam in the context of US tele-series Quantico’s depiction of a foiled terrorist attack, in which the perpetrator is seen sporting Hindu symbols of worship. 
Bottomline?
If brands are not to lose goodwill in a social media ecosystem where it is easy for businesses to get caught in the political crossfire, they must have an agile presence on these platforms, and not be content with putting out inane, bot-like responses in the way that Airtel initially did.

128,2018-12-27,Airtel,"Airtel may shed up to 70 m users as it insists on minimum balance
Bharti Airtel will lose 50-70 million customers as it ends its ‘lifetime free incoming’ plan and asks customers to maintain a minimum balance of ₹35.
The company said it is not worried about the loss and, in fact, the step will generate more average revenue per user (ARPU) as many of the SIMs acquired under that plan were not being used, a senior executive told BusinessLine on condition of anonymity.
“I think we may shed a few customers — 50 million to 70 million — as some of them may not exist at all or these could be second SIMs. That’s ok… why carry the burden?” the executive said.
How will Airtel acquire new customers? Customers moving from feature phones to 4G smartphones present an opportunity.
There is also scope for increasing the ARPU by giving better and more services, more content with partnerships and so on,” he said.
The company in October decided to do away with its lifetime free incoming calls plan for prepaid customers, as they did not spend anything for outgoing either.
It replaced some of its prepaid tariff plans with ‘minimum ARPU’ plans and asked existing users of the previous plans to make a recharge of at least ₹35 per month to continue using Airtel services.
Vodafone-Idea similarly replaced its existing ‘free’ plans with ‘limited validity’ plans. As customer complaints rose, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) directed the telcos to inform subscribers in a clear and transparent manner about the changes. But the telcos are legally entitled to withdraw any tariff plan that is older than six months.
The ARPUs of Airtel, Idea and Vodafone had dropped drastically after Reliance Jio entered the fray in 2016 with highly competitive tariffs. As of the September quarter, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea’s ARPU stood at ₹100 and ₹88 respectively, while that of RJIo was ₹131."

 Indian telecom stocks such as Vodafone Idea Ltd lost ground on Thursday after the industry regulator released monthly data that showed a bleak rise in the country's mobile phone customer base.
India’s mobile phone customer base rose 0.06 per cent, or a net 0.72 million, to 1.17 billion in October, data released by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) showed on Wednesday.
Vodafone Idea, the country's largest telecom operator by subscribers, lost 7.4 million users, while Bharti Airtel Ltd , the No. 2 telecom firm, lost 1.9 million subscribers during the month.
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd added 10.5 million subscribers to its network, making it the third biggest in the country.
Jio's entry in the market had led to widespread disruption in the domestic telecom industry, sparking a price war, stiffening competition and triggering consolidation among the bigger players.
“The top three operators have benefited from the ongoing consolidation within smaller operators in the past,” brokerage Morgan Stanley wrote in a note.
“Most smaller operators are now left with no subscribers, so it will be interesting to see market share shifts within the top players, particularly when Jio continues with an aggressive subscriber acquisition strategy compared to Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which are looking to optimize their low-end customer base,” Morgan Stanley said.
Vodafone Idea shares hit their lowest in three weeks, dropping as much as 5.2 per cent, while shares in Bharti Airtel fell 1.5 per cent.
Shares in Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, which has a total of 3.5 million users, fell up to 6.7 per cent."

When requested to contribute to this Special Edition, I was instinctively reminded of the early 1990s when this popular business daily made its debut 25 years ago. It also brought back memories of India embarking on its transformational economic journey with the introduction of economic reforms in 1991 that finally liberated the spirit of Indian entrepreneurs after decades of state control and Licence Raj. The rest, as they say, is history, as India metamorphosed from its proverbial ‘Hindu rate of growth’ to become the fastest-growing large economy in the world today.
Clearly, it’s a journey that all — entrepreneurs and consumers alike — have savoured all these years so very happily. For first-generation entrepreneurs like me, who had struggled through the licensing regime that invariably favoured the established business houses, liberalisation was a dream come true as the government opened up many sectors to private entrepreneurs.
In fact, Airtel, which has grown to become the third-largest mobile operator in the world, was born during the first flush of reforms that witnessed the opening up of sectors such as mobile telephony, aviation and broadcasting, which led to the emergence of many other entrepreneurs like me. While new entrepreneurs were making their mark in freshly opened sectors in the domestic market, Indian software was taking wing in overseas markets under the leadership of the likes of NR Narayana Murthy, Azim Premji and Shiv Nadar.
After nearly three decades of liberalisation and several bursts of reforms, India is today the toast of global investors. It’s the third-largest economy in terms of PPP today. While the GDP has galloped away to cross $2.5 trillion from $266 billion in 1991, per-capita income has expanded from a paltry $300 to over $2,000 during this period.
More than size, it’s the structural diversification of the economy, with the increasing dominance of services and reduced dependence on agriculture that really explains the transformation during this period.
The other aspect that needs to be highlighted is the coming-of-age of Indian business on the global platform. Global acquisitions by Indian companies have become routine and accepted as being driven by competence and guided by well-thought-out strategies.
For me, what has also stood out very vividly through these years is the remarkable ideological commitment of the political parties to the reform processes despite their numerous differences and compulsions within India’s diverse and complex political terrain. Industry leaders may have lost patience at times at the slow progress of reforms, but one can understand the lack of pace in a noisy democracy that goes to some election or other almost every year.
Economic liberalisation ushered in fundamental changes in the lives of consumers — rich or poor, urban or rural. Life has moved from a situation of perpetual scarcity and lack of choice, even with regard to the basic necessities of life, to an ever-widening range of options in every conceivable aspect of life: food, clothing, entertainment, banking, education, healthcare and media. The most apt example of this transformation would be the often-quoted transition from the black boxy rotary phones that only the privileged and the affluent could own after years of wait, to the sleekest smartphones running on superfast data networks, which anyone can pick up from a retail counter and activate from the comfort of home. Not just that, phones are helping customers do just about everything: banking, commerce, healthcare, education, entertainment, citizen services. In fact, mobile phones have quintessentially emerged as the most enduring symbol of transformation in our lives in recent years. Ubiquitous high-speed connectivity is going to further reinforce this change in the years to come.
Another aspect of change during the last decade that often goes unnoticed is the deepening of our democratic roots, largely facilitated by technology — social media applications in particular, which have given voice to the ordinary citizens, thereby improving the quality of governance. Redressal of citizen grievance no longer follows electoral cycles, but happens in real time, making democracy and governance more meaningful. Two or three decades may be a short period in the life of a nation with a history running into millennia; but when history is written a 100 years from now, the last few decades can well be called a defining period in our history

“Our simplified product portfolio and premium content partnerships have played out well during the quarter, translating into one of our highest ever 4G customer additions of 11 million plus. Our mobile data volume continues to expand, with a YoY growth of 190 per cent. We have deployed 24,000 broadband sites during the quarter and remain committed to invest in capacities ahead of the demand curve and provide a superior customer experience,"" Gopal Vittal, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, India & South Asia, Airtel, said. 
""Effective this quarter, we have modified our customer base measurement to represent only transacting and revenue generating customers,"" he added.

Airtel now covers 92% of the population in the North-East and Assam




Airtel now covers 92% of the population in the North-East and Assam


Bharti Airtel Ltd's shares fell 4.5 per cent on Tuesday to a near eight-week low, after ratings agency Moody's Investors Service downgraded some notes of India's second-largest telecoms company by subscribers.
Airtel, once seen as the bellwether of the domestic telecoms industry, posted a nearly 72 per cent fall in quarterly profit last Thursday, suffering from continuing pricing pressure.
The telecoms industry is still reeling from the impact of a price war, which began after the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
The shake-up resulted in industry consolidation such as London-based Vodafone Plc merging its Indian operations with Idea Cellular in a deal worth $23 billion, making it the biggest telecoms company.
The stock closed Tuesday's session at Rs 307.85, up Rs 1.25 (+0.41%) on the BSE.
Moody's downgraded the senior unsecured rating for Airtel and the backed senior unsecured notes issued by unit Bharti Airtel Int'l (Netherlands) B.V. to 'Ba1' from 'Baa3' on Tuesday.
The agency withdrew the company's 'Baa3' issuer rating and said the outlook is negative.
“The downgrade reflects uncertainty as to whether or not the company's profitability, cash flow situation and debt levels can improve sustainably and materially, given the competitive dynamics in the Indian telecom market,” Annalisa DiChiara, Moody's vice-president and senior credit officer, said in a note.
“A significant recovery in cash flow from the core Indian mobile segment is needed to strengthen the company's credit quality and support greater financial flexibility.”
Concerns over Airtel also took a toll on the S&P BSE telecom index, which dropped as much as 3 per cent.
Vodafone Idea Ltd was down 1.5 per cent ahead of its December-quarter results on Wednesday.
Smaller rival Reliance Communications Ltd extended its sharp falls after it moved the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLT) on Monday to withdraw its appeal in a dispute with Ericsson as it seeks to pursue a debt resolution plan through the country's bankruptcy court.
Last week, the company had said it would seek fast-track resolution of its debt through the tribunal, the country's court that deals with bankruptcy cases."
119,2019-02-08,Airtel,"Airtel arm signs merger pact with Telkom Kenya 
 Bharti Airtel on Friday said that its subsidiary, Airtel Networks Kenya (Airtel Kenya), has signed an agreement with Telkom Kenya for merging their respective mobile, enterprise and carrier services businesses in Kenya to operate as – ‘Airtel-Telkom’. 
The finalisation and closure of the transaction is subject to approval by the relevant authorities. The new entity will become a strong number two operator in terms of both revenues and subscribers. Airtel Kenya is currently No.2 operator in the country.
The Kenyan telecom market is right now led by Safaricom, which has a market share of 65 per cent.
“As per the agreement, both the partners will combine their operations in Kenya and establish an entity with enhanced scale, operational efficiency and strategic brand presence,” Airtel said in a statement. 
The entity will invest in networks to further accelerate roll out of future technologies. The company however, did not disclose any investment amount. 
“The Enterprise and Carrier Services businesses should benefit from a larger fibre footprint and an increased number of enterprise customers — including both large corporations and SMEs — who would have access to a diverse portfolio of world-class solutions,” the company said. 
The agreement will provide Airtel Kenya the advantage and access to Telkom Kenya’s Enterprise and Carrier Services businesses.
According to sources, the combined entity would have over 31 per cent market share. As of end September, Airtel Kenya voice and mobile data market shares was at 33 per cent and 22 per cent respectively.
Bharti Airtel, which is bleeding in the Indian market with cut-throat competition in tariffs against Reliance Jio, has some growth story in the African market. The financial performance of Airtel Africa continues to improve after turning positive in terms of net profit and operating free cash flow over the last several quarters.
For instance, for the third quarter ended December 31, Airtel Africa’s revenue grew by 11 per cent on a YoY basis. Data traffic grew by 61 per cent voice minutes increased by 25 per cent and Airtel Money throughput grew by 29 per cent on a Y-o-Y basis.
Consequently, EBITDA margin has expanded by around 2 per cent YoY and stood at 37 per cent for the quarter.
Shares of Airtel closed at ₹313.60 on the BSE on Friday, up 0.85 per cent from the previous close."

Bharti Airtel has upgraded its 4G network in Mumbai with the deployment of LTE 900 technology that will enhance experience for its smartphone customers.
“The deployment of LTE 900 will further boost Airtel’s 4G coverage, particularly inside homes and buildings. Airtel smartphone customers will enjoy a seamless high-speed data and HD quality calling experience on our upgraded network,” Amit Tripathi, CEO–Mumbai at Bharti Airtel said.

The Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Head of Digital of Bharti Airtel Ltd, Harmeen Mehta, said that one of the biggest challenges of the current world of technology is that all the internet's latest offerings like YouTube, Facebook, Ola and Uber are catering only the top 300 million people while the remaining one billion remain unserved.
She was delivering a keynote address on the topic, 'Future Forward : India Leaping Ahead', during the inaugural session of the Madras Management Association (MMA's) annual convention 2019 held here on Saturday.
Mehta highlighted that while India’s mobile penetration is close to 88 per cent, the smartphone penetration is only under 40 per cent.
""Half of the country's population consists of women and within that only less than half of them even know what the internet is all about,"" Mehta said. She added that only one-third of the women even know that smartphones can be used for other purposes besides making calls.
""Can we really leap forward into the future without taking this 50 per cent population with us ? "" Mehta asked.
She also added that the latest disruptions like big data, artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT) and blockchain will help technology companies to tap the largely ‘impenetrable’ population.
""AI-based technologies like 'vernacular voice bots' can break the literacy barrier and bring non-English speaking people into its fold,"" Mehta added.
In his special address, Adrian Terron, Head - Customer Centricity, Tata Group said that 'consumers' are currently driving all the technological changes and transformation and Indian consumers in particular, is very different because they know their place in the world.
Terron listed out premiumisation, digitisation, silvers (people above 60 years), purpose and after-sales service as five megatrends that are shaping consumer behaviour.
Elaborating on each of the trends, Terron said that quality conscious Indian consumers are now willing to spend 30 per cent more for premium products and services.
He also added that people above 60 years of age are more loyal to their brands than the younger generation. ""With India's elderly population at 300 million, this gives big opportunities for businesses,"" Terron said.
Highlighting that 78 per cent of millenials believes businesses are focussed only on their own agenda without any focus on the society, Terron said, ""80 per cent of 'purpose-led brands' have outperformed the markets.""
In his welcome address, L Ramkumar, President, MMA said, ""The annual convention will have contemporary theme every year and this year we chose this topic because, India with the current growth is poised to leap forward into the future.""
The event also saw the release of convention special issue of 'Business Mandate', the monthly magazine of the management association."
115,2019-02-21,Airtel,"DCC defers decision on Airtel, Vodafone, Idea penalty to next meeting 
 The Digital Communications Commission (DCC), formerly known as the Telecom Commission, on Thursday deferred the decision on cumulative penalty of Rs 3,050 crore on Airtel, Vodafone and Idea to its next meeting, according to an official source. The telecom watchdog, TRAI, in October 2016 recommended imposing a total penalty of Rs 3,050 crore on Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea for allegedly denying interconnectivity to newcomer Reliance Jio.
The regulator stopped short of recommending cancellation of their telecom licences, saying it may lead to significant consumer inconvenience. 
“The decision on the Rs 3,050-crore penalty on Airtel, Vodafone and Idea has been deferred to the next meeting,” an official source told PTI on Thursday.
The penalty on Airtel and Vodafone works out to about Rs 1,050 crore each, while in the case of Idea Cellular it comes to about Rs 950 crore. 
The TRAI’s recommendation came on a complaint by Reliance Jio that over 75 per cent of calls on its network were failing as the incumbents were not releasing sufficient points of interconnection (PoIs). 
In August, Reliance Jio had submitted to TRAI that it would need 12,727 PoIs for mobile services and 3,068 PoIs for STD call facility before commercial launch of its services. The company launched commercial services on September 5."

 Finnish telecom gear maker Nokia Sunday said Bharti Airtel will conduct trial of the former’s homogeneous fronthaul solution which can support 4G and 5G services.
“The modernisation of the transport infrastructure is crucial for ensuring the ultra-high speed and extremely low latency, promised by 5G. We look forward to this trial with Bharti Airtel, which is a crucial step towards preparing the networks for 5G,” Sanjay Malik, Head of India Market, Nokia, said in a statement.
This trial is part of Bharti Airtel’s strategy to make its network future ready to meet the growing demand for high speed data in India, it added.
A Nokia official said that no final date to start trial has been decided but it is ready with the solution for trial.
Nokia said this trial has the potential to improve the performance of service providers’ existing network even as it prepares the network for 5G and to meet the future demand.
Fronthaul equipment are installed between antenna, which receives signals, and baseband unit, which processes and directs communication in telecom network.
With 5G coming in, networks will require huge capacity to process data.
Nokia’s converged fronthaul transport solution helps bring down fibre requirement, the statement said.
“The upgrade of the transport network is also essential to cater to the booming consumption of mobile broadband services and enable world-class digital services. Nokia is our longstanding partner and we look forward to their support in our journey towards 5G,” Randeep Sekhon, CTO, Bharti Airtel, said."

In the previous quarter, Jio topped in terms of standalone AGR
   -  The Hindu


 Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, could lose as much as Rs 150 billion ($2.1 billion) this fiscal year when costs such as handset subsidies are included, said Chris Lane and Samuel Chen, analysts at Sanford C Bernstein & Co.
That would be a bigger deficit than those of its larger rivals Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, even though the company known as Jio will probably overcome them over the next 12 months in terms of service revenue and subscribers, the analysts wrote in a note to clients dated February 26. The fiscal year of Jio’s parent, Reliance Industries Ltd ends March 31. 
Jio, part of the group controlled by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, introduced a free-for-life call service and a price war in one of the worlds most crowded mobile markets. That push, which has included offering low-cost phones, has resulted in net handset subsidies likely amounting to Rs 72 billion and a total invested capital of Rs 2.6 trillion, Bernstein estimates.
“The phone subsidies are carried by a separate unit, Reliance Retail Ltd, and so aren’t visible on Jio’s profit and loss statement, according to Lane and Chen. Jio also uses non-standard depreciation metrics in its accounting,” they said.
Ambani’s wireless phone business, which he has said may conduct an initial public offering, has reported consecutive quarterly profits. To make a positive return on investment, the carrier will have to reduce handset subsidies and increase revenue from users, according to Bernstein.
Vodafone Idea will probably post a net loss of Rs 32 billion for the year ending March. Bharti Airtel is expected to report a Rs 7.5 billion.."

Bharti Airtel, which is keen to make rival Vodafone Idea a partner in the independent optical fibre company it is setting up, has invited the latter to be a part of the new firm. If Vodafone Idea decides to join, this would be the single largest independent fibre company in the country.
“We always talk to each other, and our company is being formed as we had filed for a demerger of the fibre unit. We will have a fibre company in place by end of March, and in that we have invited Vodafone to come and join,” Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal told a select group of Indian journalists here. While the initial response from Vodafone was “warm”, the plan is to set up an independent tower firm on the lines of Indus Towers for shared infrastructure. In 2017, Airtel said it will transfer its optical fibre business to a wholly-owned subsidiary — Telesonic Networks — and if Vodafone “accepts the invitation” the structure will be altered along the lines of Indus Towers, he added.
“Vodafone has a lot of fibre, we have a lot of fibre and when we combine these, both the companies will gain about 25 per cent capacity on routes we don’t have, but importantly all the future build for fibre starts to become common.”
“The more the merrier,” Mittal, said when asked whether Airtel will extend the same courtesy to Reliance Jio Infocomm. The Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) moving up to ₹200 will help the industry become sustainable and it moving over to ₹300 would be ideal.
At present, the industry ARPU hovers at about ₹100 per month.
 
The Indian telecom industry is seeking allocation of the sub-6 GHz spectrum to roll out 5G services and not the millimetre wave.
“My own view is 3500 MHz will be the one on which India probably will launch the services, but an operator needs 100 MHz. Eventually, India will get into 5G in step with the world and my recommendation is that the Government must encourage 5G coming into India early, rather than late...,” he said.
Stating that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s price recommended is high, the country is readying infrastructure while there is no hurdle to spectrum.
Way forward
Airtel, which generally invests ₹23,000-₹24,000 crore every year in India, has put all large capex cycle behind it. Airtel is also gearing up for Initial Public Offering (IPO) plans for Africa, which is slated to happen sometime this year.

Bharti Airtel’s board has approved an ₹32,000 crore fund raise, which includes a rights issue of ₹25,000 crore and perpetual bonds with equity credit of ₹7,000 crore (foreign denominated).
Issue price of ₹220/share implies an issuance of 1,134 million rights shares, which would result in 22 per cent post equity dilution.
The fund raise is likely to bring down net debt/EBITDA sharply to 3.5x (FY19), as against the current estimate of 4.5x. Additionally, the plans of Africa IPO and Bharti Infratel stake sale will help raise ₹40,000 crore, which should reduce its net debt to ₹47,500 crore (net debt to EBITDA of 1.6x) by FY21.
Moreover, we believe that capex intensity has peaked out, which should reduce its annual cash burn from ₹16,900 crore in FY19 to positive FCF of about ₹4,300 crore in FY21, thus restricting the increase in net debt.
In our view, despite the steep dilution, the fund raising plan is a welcome positive which will allow Bharti to be self-sufficient and manage operations without any ARPU increase. Maintain ‘Buy’ with a target price of ₹380."

Bharti Infratel Ltd said on Tuesday mobile carrier and its majority shareholder Bharti Airtel Ltd will lower its direct stake in the telecom tower company by more than a half.
Airtel's unit Nettle Infrastructure Investments Ltd will buy an up to 32 per cent stake in Bharti Infratel by March 18, Infratel said.
Airtel will own an 18.3 per cent stake in Infratel after the transfer, down from its current stake of 50.33 per cent.
“Whenever Airtel transfers stake to Nettle Infrastructure, (eventually) they will sell the stake to a third party. This will help them raise money,” said a Mumbai-based an analyst.
Airtel, like its peers in the industry, has faced immense competition since the entry of Reliance Industries' upstart Jio in late 2016 with its debts soaring and profit margins eroding.
Singapore Telecommunications Ltd said last week it will buy roughly $525 million worth Airtel stock as part of Airtel's plan to raise $4.6 billion through shares and bonds.

Bharti Airtel is planning to reduce its direct stake in telecom tower firm Bharti Infratel by more than half, to 18.3 per cent by selling about 32 per cent of shares to another subsidiary, Nettle Infrastructure Investments Ltd.
The board of Bharti Airtel, in order to explore a potential monetisation of stake in Bharti Infratel in the future, has approved sale or transfer of up to 59.19 crore shares of Infratel to Nettle Infrastructure Investments in its meeting on December 20, the company informed the stock exchanges on Tuesday. This was also informed to the stock exchanges on the same day, it added.
The New Delhi-based company was replying to a stock exchange query, which sought an explanation for the company’s stock price rising 6 per cent during the day. The query was raised following certain media reports that said: “Bharti Airtel surges 6 per cent post co to sell stake in Bharti Infratel.”
At present, Bharti Airtel owns 50.33 per cent and Nettle owns 3.18 per cent stake in Bharti Infratel. Shares in Bharti Airtel closed up 5.12 per cent at ₹350.80, while that in Bharti Infratel ended down 0.86 per cent at ₹316.60 on a strong BSE.
Earlier on March 7, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte said it will invest ₹5,000 crore in Airtel in an attempt to boost the company’s war chest amid cut-throat competition. GIC, which joins investors from Japan to Canada to invest in the telecom operator, will pick up about 4 per cent stake in Airtel by subscribing to the operator’s ₹25,000 crore rights issue.
GIC’s investment will be part of the rights issue in which its promoters — Bharti Group, Bharti Telecom and Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (Singtel) — will also take part."

 A Bharti Group company, Indo Teleports, has approached the Telecom Department for in-flight connectivity licence, that allows service providers to offer connectivity and data services to Indian and foreign airlines, sources said.
 Sources privy to the development said that Indo Teleports, a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel, has applied to the Telecom Department for the said licence and that the proposal is currently under examination.
Airtel, however, declined to comment to a detailed questionnaire sent in this regard.
 Last month, Hughes Communications India (HCIL) became the the first company to be granted the in-flight and maritime connectivity (IFMC) licence in the country by the Telecom Department, after the government notified rules for in-flight, maritime mobile phone services in December last year.
On March 6, Tatanet Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nelco, announced that it had obtained in-flight, maritime connectivity licence from the Government.
 “The IFMC licence will make it possible to have uninterrupted access to voice, data and video services while also travelling on aircrafts, sailing vessels, cruise liners etc in India, using satellite technology,” Nelco had then said in a statement.
 According to Euroconsult, over 23,000 commercial aircraft will offer connectivity to their passengers by 2027, up from 7,400 aircraft in 2017. Northern Sky Research’s Aeronautical SatCom Market’s 2017 report predicts that by the end of 2019, broadband VSAT (very small aperture terminal) connectivity will be installed on one out of every three commercial passenger aircraft, and will rise to two out of every three by the end of 2026."

99,2019-03-18,Airtel,"India may not lag China on 5G: Report


With Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio) expected to rollout 5G services in the second-half of calendar year 2020 (H2CY20), albeit selectively, India may not lag China in launching the services. On 4G, India was behind China in rolling out the services by 2-3 years, according to a note by SBICap Securities.
“To maintain market leadership, we see RJio moving soon to 5G (H2CY20),” it said.
Jio’s early 5G move is likely to be driven by the recent capital rise by incumbent telecos (both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea). The incumbents are seen raising as much as $10 billion through various initiatives (amount raised likely to be $16 billion if tower sales go through) and most of the funds are likely to go into boosting 4G capacity, the note said.
Earlier in February, RIL President Mathew Oommen told BusinessLine that RJio is ready to launch 5G services in India, immediately after the spectrum allocation. RJio, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), is the only operator in the country which is ready for 5G, he added. 
READ THE STORY:- RJio ready to launch 5G services
If the entire $16 billion raised is deployed in 4G networks, Vodafone-Idea and Bharti may add a combined incremental capacity of about 425 million 4G subscribers over the next 24 months. In the interim, Jio may continue to gain market share as incumbents, particularly Vodafone Idea, are faced with complex network integration and spectrum re-farming.
“We see Jio gaining share and achieving revenue market share of about 39 per cent by financial year 2021 (from current about 30 per cent), Vodafone Idea’s RMS declining to 25 per cent (from 30 per cent) and Bharti holding ground. However, post network integration and 4G capacity boost, incumbent telcos are seen narrowing the 4G gap versus RJio,” it said.
The note also said RJio would hike tariffs by at least 15-20 per cent driven by increased investments in 5G upgrade. The company’s tower monetisation may be an additional and early catalyst for price hike of about 6 per cent over the next 6—9 months.
TOWER CONSOLIDATION
Despite significant consolidation in India’s wireless space, the country’s telecom tower sector remains fragmented with three tower companies.
“As such, we believe consolidation is very likely in the tower sector. Also in the 5G era, all towers will be of value as 5G is all about network densification,” it said, adding, tenancy growth would remain “muted”.

 Bharti Airtel is making progress in 4G, but Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio is increasingly becoming voice Sim, as customers are using it as a primary voice Sim, according to an UBS report on Telecom sector.
The ‘Evidence Lab’ survey by UBS said that there is a decline in multi-Sim ownership, but battle lines are shifting towards smaller towns. For instance, fewer subscribers are changing their main Sim now as compared to 3-12 months ago, especially in metros, it said.
At an industry level, the survey results show material reduction in multi-Sim ownership from 1.33x to 1.22x between March-April 2018 and December-January 2019, and among smartphone users, this is down from 1.5x to 1.36x, the report said.
“The results also show a large proportion of Jio users are now using it as primary voice Sim, which we believe is essential for eventual stabilisation of competitive and pricing environment – we see it highly unlikely that operators can raise prices in an environment of high multi-Sim ownership,” it said. 
Customer satisfaction levels are comparable across the three main operators in metros, which should again drive stability in competitive dynamics, the survey said. 
In non-metros however, customer satisfaction levels with Bharti and Vodafone-Idea (VIL) still lag that of Jio and willingness of respondents to change their primary Sim is higher than in metros, leaving perhaps another opportunity for Jio to gain market share as Airtel and VIL catch up on their 4G network coverage with the planned re-farming of 900MHz band.
The study also said that Airtel has made solid progress in increasing its share of smartphone subscribers, while Jio is maintaining its dominant share. But VIL is losing share.
“Indeed, incidence of Airtel's Sims being used as primary data Sim is now almost comparable to Jio, signalling that the company is starting to succeed in its strategy of becoming the primary 4G Sim slot among its 4G subscribers,” it said.
JioPhone's momentum in urban areas is also growing, but it still has opportunity to gain share in non-metros, it said adding that satisfaction levels with JioPhone are higher than other feature phone users, and more than half of JioPhone users want to buy a smartphone in their next purchase opening up an up-selling opportunity.
The report also indicated that customers are increasing their engagement levels with telco-owned apps, particularly those related to TV, music and content, whereas other apps such as JioChat continue to have a limited audience. The survey was conducted from December 15 to January 21 by a face-to-face interview of 2,120 mobile service users in 13 cities."

95,2019-04-11,Airtel,"DoT seeks ₹8,500 crore as bank guarantee for Airtel-Tata Teleservices merger
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has approved the merger of Tata Teleservices (TTSL) and Tata Tele Maharashtra (TTML) with Bharti Airtel, subject to the condition that the latter furnishes a bank guarantee of around ₹8,500 crore, said official sources on Thursday.
The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in January had approved Airtel’s acquisition of TTSL mobility business, but said the merger would be subject to the approval by the DoT.
The merger will help Airtel strengthen its 4G network and compete with Reliance Jio as the Sunil Bharti Mittal-owned firm gets additional spectrum pool of 178.5 MHz in the 1800, 2100 and 850 MHz bands.
The merger arrangement involves TTSL, Airtel and Bharti Hexacom (a subsidiary of Airtel).
As part of the agreement, Airtel will absorb TTSL’s operations in 19 telecom circles (17 under TTSL and 2 under TTML).
A conditional nod for the merger was approved by Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha on Tuesday and it has been received by Airtel on Wednesday late evening, said sources close to the development.
“There is a confirmation of Airtel receiving the letter late last night (Wednesday) and now a response is awaited,” a government source told BusinessLine.
In the letter, the DoT has asked Airtel to furnish a bank guarantee of a total of ₹8,500 crore and both the companies will submit an undertaking on matter related to court cases before the merger is taken on record, the official said.
The merger will be taken on record after Airtel submits the bank guarantee for one-time spectrum charges and the rest for the deferred payment of spectrum that would be acquired from TTSL. According to industry experts, Airtel may go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) opposing against the bank guarantee, like it did while merging Telenor’s business last year.
During the acquisition of Telenor also, Airtel had approached the TDSAT against the DoT’s order of bank guarantee of around ₹1,700 crore as a condition for the merger, in which Airtel had won the case.
The DoT had later moved to Supreme Court challenging the telecom tribunal’s order and which the apex court directed the government to clear its merger with Telenor without requiring Airtel to provide a ₹1,499 crore bank guarantee."

The short-term outlook for Bharti Airtel (₹341.95) remains positive despite the stock falling on Friday. It finds immediate support at ₹322 and a conclusive close below this level can alter the positive view for the stock. An immediate resistance for Bharti Airtel appears at ₹360 and a close above this level can lift it to ₹383. We expect the stock to remain positive.
F&O pointers: The Bharti Airtel April futures shed over 4 lakh shares in open interest on Friday. The futures also trades at a marginal discount with respect to the underlying stock. This signals unwinding of long positions. Option trading indicates a range of ₹320-370 for Bharti Airtel.
Strategy: Traders can consider buying Bharti Airtel April ₹350 call, which closed with a premium of ₹5.35. As the market lot is 1,700 per contract, it would cost traders ₹9,095. Traders can suffer a maximum loss of the premium paid (₹9,095). This will happen if Bharti Airtel turns weak from the current position. Profit potentials are huge, if the stock rises swiftly.








 
 
We advice traders to hold the position if the premium value rises to ₹12 or falls ₹1.80. Holding the position till expiry may be more rewarding for traders.
Follow up: Hold YES Bank position."

Shares of Bharti Airtel declined over 3 per cent on Tuesday after its March quarter results failed to lift investors’ sentiment.
The scrip fell 3.10 per cent to close at Rs 323.05 on the BSE. During the day, it dropped 3.71 per cent to Rs 321.
On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), its shares declined 2.87 per cent to close at Rs 323.85.
In terms of traded volume, 5.72 lakh shares were traded on the BSE and over 1.74 crore shares traded on the NSE during the day.
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Monday reported a surprise 29 per cent surge in March quarter net profit as exceptional income gains and Africa business helped offset losses in India mobile services operations.
The company, whose profitability has been battered by intense price competition posed by richest Indian Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio, earned a net profit of Rs 107.2 crore in the January-March period as against Rs 82.9 crore it earned in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.
This is the first rise in profit after several quarters for the company. Revenue soared 6.2 per cent to Rs 20,602.2 crore for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The firm had an exceptional income gain of Rs 2,022.1 crore in the quarter, it said in a regulatory filing to stock exchanges.
Airtel neither issued the customary press release detailing earnings statement and management commentary nor provided average revenue per user, a key metrics tracked by analysts.
The company also signed a deal to combine its VSAT ops in India with Hughes."

   -  Reuters




In a war for the control of India’s billion-plus mobile-services market, tycoon Sunil Mittal seems to be floundering in the face of a juggernaut unleashed by Mukesh Ambani.
For at least a fourth quarter in a row, Mittal’s Bharti Airtel Ltd. shored up its profits with one-time gains, masking headwinds posed by upstart Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Jio’s roll-out, after its 2016 debut, has knocked Airtel from its perch in a consolidation that shrank the industry to three players from about a dozen four years ago.

Airtel is struggling to add subscribers in a saturated market after Jio managed to lure more than 300 million users over the past three years -- a quarter of the world’s second-largest market. The aggressive expansion of Jio with free calls and cheaper data, backed by the deep pockets of Asia’s richest man, was bad news for highly indebted incumbents engaged in a tariff war that had pushed call rates to less than a cent.
Shriveling earnings portend further trouble for Airtel. Already saddled with more than $17 billion of debt -- the highest among Asian peers -- it is also preparing to spend billions more on 5G airwaves at a government auction in coming months. Adding to its woes, Moody’s Investors Service cut its rating to junk earlier this year.
The New Delhi-based company is counting on some asset sales, a rights issue and an initial public offering in London of its Africa unit to bolster its finances.
Airtel said in an exchange filing on Monday that a one-time net gain of ₹ 2,020 crore ($291 million) on account of a credit related to re-assessment of levies boosted its net income to ₹ 110 crore for the quarter through March. 
Although revenue rose 6 percent to ₹ 20,600 crore in the period, data provided by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India show Airtel added a net 53,493 subscribers in the first two months of the year, compared with Jio’s 17.1 million. While Airtel didn’t provide user addition data for the quarter, Jio reported an increase of 26.6 million."

India needs more time to be fully prepared for 5G, said Vora


Reliance Jio Infocomm’s momentum will continue on the back of its wider 4G coverage and cheaper tariffs, even as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India Ltd (VIL) continue to face the risk of continued revenue market share loss, a report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA-ML) said.
Incumbent telecom operators are also seen focussing on select areas to improve the network and add subscribers, instead of adopting a carpet rollout approach.
RJio, on other hand, is looking to achieve a 99 per cent 4G population coverage, the report said.
The congestion among incumbent telecom networks is also rising due to continued increase in data users and usage. 
VoLTE is still being optimised and not working smoothly, it added.
According to the brokerage firm, even congestion on the RJio network is “selectively” rising, but the company is “aggressively” investing in small-cells among others to resolve these issues. The network integration of Vodafone and Idea is progressing smoothly, and the company has picked up its pace in investments to improve 4G coverage. 
The focus on monetisation of content has started to pick up pace, with RJio already planning to monetise JioSaavn and other apps. 
For FY20, capex for Bharti and Jio is expected to decline on a YoY basis, and for VIL, it is expected to flatten. Investments and focus on fixed broadband and enterprise business have increased for both Bharti and RJio, it added.
The brokerage firm does not expect any tariff hike post-elections, as it believes RJio (the telco with the cheapest tariffs) is unlikely to raise tariffs till it decisively becomes the top operator in India. 
The management of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) continues to reiterate that its focus is on subscriber addition and increasing smartphone usage among subscribers, rather than monetisation."
80,2019-05-14,Airtel,"Airtel may soon phase out postpaid plans below ₹499
 Telecom operator Bharti Airtel has tweaked its post-paid plans, a move that involves gradual phasing out of offerings that are less than Rs 499 and retaining limited number of plans above it.
 The move is aimed at simplification of plans and would also help the company chase better realisation from mobile subscribers, improving the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), according to a source. The source said the company is in the process of phasing out post-paid plans of less than Rs 499, as other plans pack in more value and digital content for subscribers willing to shell out a tad bit more.
 Essentially, it has scrapped the Rs 299 plan and is in the process of gradually phasing out Rs 349 and Rs 399 post-paid plans. Even the number of plans above Rs 499 will be reduced to just three - Rs 749, Rs 999 and Rs 1,599. When contacted, a company spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.
 As of December 31, 2018, Airtel’s mobile services customer base in India was about 284 million. The company, which is in the midst of raising Rs 25,000 crore through a rights issue - while announcing its fourth quarter results recently steered clear of the customary investor call and management commentary nor it provided ARPU - a key metrics tracked by analysts. 
A recent report by SBICap Securities, however, said Airtel had “done well” on ARPU as it seems to have improved about 20 per cent sequentially, while Jio’s ARPU declined about 3 per cent. On Monday, rival Vodafone Idea reported that its ARPU for the March quarter grew 16.3 per cent to Rs 104, from Rs 89 in the October-December 2018 period.
 “Subscriber traction is something that Bharti needs to pick up, as ARPU gains incrementally may be much lesser but may still continue, driven by upselling for low-end subscribers and 2G-to-4G upgrade,” SBICap Securities said in a the report."
79,2019-05-16,Airtel,"Airtel, Vodafone user base plummets with Minimum Recharge Plan rollout
The Minimum Recharge Plans launched by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) to clean up their low-paying subscriber base have resulted in a significant reduction in user base.
In the third quarter of FY19, VIL reported a 35 million reduction in user base and another 53 million during the fourth quarter. 
sIts total subscriber base was 334 million as of March end, according to a report by research firm Morgan Stanley.
VIL’s management had said that there could be some residual impact that could flow into the first quarter of fiscal 2020, it added.
VIL, during its earnings announcement earlier this week, said that the sequential stabilisation of revenues in Q4 benefited from the introduction of ‘service validity vouchers’ across the country in Q3, which required customers to make a minimum recharge of ₹35 (for a validity of 28 days).
This had resulted in a fall in user base as ‘Incoming-only’ or ‘Low ARPU’ (Average Revenue Per User) customers migrated their spending from multiple SIMs to a single SIM. 
According to the Morgan Stanley report, Airtel also reported a reduction of 48.5 million users during the third quarter of the year. The New Delhi-based firm is yet to disclose the fourth quarter numbers due to the ongoing rights issue. The subscriber market share of VIL fell to 32 per cent in FY19, compared with 36 per cent in FY18, while that of Airtel was steady at 26 per cent. 
Reliance Jio Infocomm gained market share at the expense of VIL and other operators, with the Mukesh Ambani-led company improving subscriber market share to 29 per cent in FY19 (16 per cent in FY18).
VIL reported a 17 per cent quarter-on-quarter improvement in ARPU, a gauge of a telecom firm’s financial strength, to ₹104 in the fourth quarter on clean-up in low paying or non-paying subscriber base. 
Airtel’s ARPU have improved 21 per cent on a QoQ basis, primarily due to the same reason. 
VIL’s EBITDA margin improved to about 13 per cent in Q4, while for Airtel’s India wireless segment, it improved to 23 per cent, the report said."

Bharti Airtel on Friday closed the rights issue of up to ₹24,939 crore, which would help the company cut its debt of more than ₹1.12-lakh crore. The company’s biggest rights issue of around ₹25,000 crore was open between May 3 and May 17, the closing date.
The rights issue has been oversubscribed going by the disclosure made by the company to the stock exchanges.
“The company would like to bring to your notice that based on preliminary information received the rights issue has been oversubscribed,” Airtel said in a filing to the stock exchanges.
The right issue consisted of an issue of fully paid-up shares at ₹220 a share and a foreign currency perpetual bond issue worth ₹7,000 crore.
The board of directors of the company, on April 19, had approved the rights issue, and had said that the capital infusion will help it continue to invest in building large network capacity, and create content and technology partnerships to ensure strong customer experience.
This is the fourth attempt by the Sunil Mittal-led company to cut its debt, which has accumulated due to stiff competition from Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio. Airtel had realised around ₹23,000 crore by selling its stakes in its towers arm, African business, and DTH business.
Recently, promoters of Vodafone-Idea too, infused ₹17,920 crore into the company via a ₹25,000-crore rights issue to compete with the rivals.

 It added that related documents have been submitted for approval to the UK Financial Conduct Authority. The company, which offers telecom services in 14 countries in Africa, plans to use the proceeds from issue of new shares to reduce debt. Commenting on the planned offer, Sunil Bharti Mittal Chairman of Airtel Africa, exuded confidence that the company is in a “strong position” to build its own capital market profile.
 “Since first investing in Africa almost nine years ago, we have well leveraged our expertise in emerging markets to deliver on a clearly-defined strategy to build Airtel Africa into a market leading mobile service provider, increasingly expanding beyond voice into data services and Airtel Money. Today, Airtel Africa is the second largest mobile operator in Africa,” Mittal noted. 
He further added: “With the recent equity investments into the business by globally recognised long-term investors, we believe that Airtel Africa is in a strong position to build its own capital market profile, allowing others to join us in a real business success story”. The new Board of Directors is committed to carry forward the strong legacy of corporate governance of the parent company, Mittal pointed out."

In a move that will enable them to take on over-the-top (OTT) players, which have been eating into their revenues, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio) are in advanced stages of testing Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) services.
VoWiFi is hailed across the world as the technology that keeps users connected even without a mobile signal. Commonly referred as WiFi calling, VoWiFi eliminates mobile blackspots for users by making it possible to make and receive calls over WiFi or wireless internet connections.
Currently, this type of service is being offered by OTT players such as WhatsApp.
It also doesn’t require mobile networks nor SIM cards to facilitate the calls. Further, the receiver doesn’t need to have WiFi calling facilities. Calls can be accessed on a Voice over Long Term Evolution (VoLTE, the technology for 4G services) handset.
Another benefit is that users can seamlessly move from VoLTE to VoWiFi without the call getting disconnected. Currently, if a user switches from mobile voice calling to Wi-Fi network, the call gets disrupted.
Bharti Airtel is testing the services across its leading circles such as Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
The benefit of the service is that it will provide connectivity to customers in rural and far-flung areas where it is difficult to set up mobile infrastructure, a source close to the development said. RJio, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), is testing the services across Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Mumbai with plans to extend to a couple of more circles. If successful, the company intends to launch the services accessible over its Jiophones, mostly as an app, a different source said.
“The testing is in advanced stages and a launch of the services will depend on the feasibility tests, which are being conducted for accessibility, voice clarity and robustness of the service,” the second source added.
The UK-headquartered Vodafone Group has already launched the services in certain countries, while its India plans were still unclear. With the success abroad, it can can launch the services anytime in India.
Telecom companies have always complained of OTT players — such as Skype, WhatsApp, Hike, Facebook and Google — eating into their voice revenues, and had sought them to be brought under a licensing regime, since they offer similar services such as voice calling and messaging.
In 2018, the Department of Telecommunications had approved voice calls over a Wi-Fi network to improve connectivity, especially in rural areas."

Though Airtel’s ARPU rose in the January-March quarter it is still not at a sustainable level for the telecom sector
   -  REUTERS


Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Friday said the base price of spectrum recommended by the regulator is “exorbitant” and unaffordable, and urged the government to review the price of radiowaves to set the stage for an aggressive 5G play.
“These prices are exorbitant, given that the state of 5G ecosystem is still nascent. So, we would hope that the government brings down the prices of spectrum and reserve them. That is the stage where we would look seriously at 5G,” the company’s MD and CEO, India and South Asia, Gopal Vittal, said.
Vittal said the base prices recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) places the radiowaves in a ballpark range of ₹50,000-55,000 crore for 100 MHz of spectrum.
“5G requires large quantities of spectrum. If you have 40 MHz, you don’t get 5G-type requirement, so in terms of speed and latency, you require large chunks of spectrum. Clearly, these are prices we can’t afford,” he said.
In an earnings call, the management of Bharti Airtel said the competitive intensity has stabilised to the extent that the company has not seen a reduction in tariffs.
But it conceded that the marketplace continues to be brutal, given that the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) — which used to be about ₹200 — has slipped to ₹125. 
The capital expenditure of the company had already peaked in FY19, and the current financial year would see a moderation in capex, the company said. However, it did not provide a guidance for the same.
The company said that its ARPU rose by 6.5 per cent to ₹123 in the January-March quarter which is still not at a “sustainable” level for the sector.
 The company had an ARPU of ₹116 in the same period a year ago."
73,2019-06-04,Airtel,"Airtel Africa plans Nigeria listing too
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel has said that its subsidiary Airtel Africa expects to raise at least $750 million (around ₹5,189 crore) through an initial public offering and subsequent listing on the London Stock Exchange.
Additionally, Airtel Africa is also considering listing its shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, the company said in a regulatory filing.
Airtel Africa, last year had raised $1.25 billion from six investors including Temasek Holdings Pte, SoftBank Group Corp and Warburg Pincus, giving it an equity value of about $4.4 billion, which is currently hovering around over $5.5 billion as per market watchers.
“The offer is targeted to raise $750 million (plus a primary green-shoe option of up to 15 per cent) and will be used to reduce the net debt,” Airtel said in the filing.
It said that Airtel Africa intends to proceed with an initial public offering for admission and listing of its shares on the main market of London Stock Exchange (premium segment).
A regulatory filing by Airtel Africa also said that the company intends to have a free-float of at least 25 per cent of its issued share capital, and certain pre-IPO investors are expected to contribute towards the minimum 25 per cent free float.
“The indicative price range in respect of the offer as well as the number of shares to be sold in the offer, will be determined in due course and contained in the prospectus expected to be published by Airtel Africa in the coming weeks,” it said. Airtel Africa offers telecom services in 14 countries in Africa and is the second-largest mobile operator in Africa by number of active subscribers (as of December 31, 2018).

72,2019-06-04,Airtel,"Telecom companies see tower rentals fall for first time in five years
Telecom tower companies in the country have reported “massive” tenancy losses over the past one-and-a-half years, with tower rentals starting to fall during the second half of fiscal 2018.
This is the first time the rentals have fallen in the past five years.
The tower rentals in the past 12 quarters indicate a stabilising trend till the first half of fiscal 2018 and then a drop for the first time in five years in the second half of fiscal 2018 owing to tenancy losses, according to study by Crisil.
The recent merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular has resulted in over 57,000 tenancy losses. Further reduction of about 21,000 tenancies is expected in the first half of fiscal 2020, it said.
While exit penalties are expected to partially offset the revenue loss, the impact of tenancy losses is expected to spill over to fiscal 2020 as well.
Telecom companies are currently focusing on densification of 4G networks. The replacement of 2G and 3G Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) with 4G ones will slow down net BTS additions to about 1.55 lakh in fiscal 2020, against 2.75 lakh in fiscal 2019.
The number of BTSs per tower is, however, expected to increase marginally to about 3.85 this fiscal, compared with 3.67 in fiscal 2019, on increased loading by telcos to increase their capacity per site and support existing coverage during high traffic and congestion.
This loading results in a discount to telcos (need to pay just 10-15 per cent of rent), which reduces the potential for higher topline of towercos.
The telecom sector moving towards an oligopolistic structure, with three players accounting for more than 90 per cent of market share, will pose challenges for towercos. This will put pressure on rent revenue per tower as the number of tenants per tower would go down.
Further, the stressed financial condition of debt-laden telecom incumbents will restrain any material hike in rentals, at least over the medium term. In addition, through the towers added by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Reliance Jio Infocomm account for a considerable share of captive towers, the revenue from these towers does not flow to the industry."

Airtel Africa, a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel, on Friday said that it has priced 80 pence (NGN 363) per share in its initial public offering. Based on the offer price, the market capitalisation of the company will be around £3.1 billion (NGN 1.4 trillion or $3.9 billion) upon completion of the offer (including the over-allotment option).
However, according to a Bloomberg report, the stock plunged in London trading, making it among the worst debuts on the European exchanges this year. Airtel Africa dropped as much as 16 per cent to 67 pence a share, matching the first-day decline for OssDsign AB last month.
The stock was trading at 71.4 pence as of 9.41 am (local time).
Bharti Airtel in February last year had announced the intention for an IPO for the African unit to reduce its net debt of around $4 billion by issuing the new shares.
Commenting on the result of the IPO, Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman of Airtel Africa, said, “The strong support we have received from institutional investors demonstrates the attractive investment proposition Airtel Africa offers the market. Since first investing in Africa almost nine years ago, we have leveraged our expertise in emerging markets to deliver on a clearly defined strategy to build Airtel Africa into a market-leading mobile service provider, increasingly expanding beyond voice into data services and Airtel Money.”
Airtel Africa is a leading provider of telecommunications and mobile money services, with presence in 14 countries, primarily in East Africa and Central and West Africa. Airtel Africa serves a large and fast-growing addressable market, with attractive mobile data and mobile money growth prospects as non-voice revenue remains lower than other geographies.
The offer was oversubscribed with strong interest from a variety of reputed global investors across the UK, the US, Africa, Europe, West Asia and Asia. It also came with a secondary listing on the Nigeria Stock Exchange with meaningful allocations to Nigerian investors.
Immediately, following UK Admission and Nigerian Admission, the company will have a free float in excess of 25 per cent, as certain of the pre-IPO investors’ holdings will also constitute free float.
“We are now the first telecom company to simultaneously list on the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange and Nigerian Stock Exchange through an IPO,” Raghunath Mandava, Chief Executive Officer of Airtel Africa, said.
Bloomberg adds: The weak market showing for the African carrier, the continent’s second-largest by subscribers, comes as parent Bharti Airtel struggles back home with a year-long price war and mounting debt. Proceeds from the IPO will help the India-based wireless operator pare debt just as it also needs funds to upgrade its mobile network to fifth-generation technology.
“Airtel Africa may be suffering from broader investor unease about telecom carriers in emerging markets,” said Ally McKinnon, a fund manager at Scottish Investment Trust Plc who didn’t participate in the IPO."

62,2019-07-24,Airtel,"Communications panel okays ₹3,050-cr penalty imposed on Airtel, Voda-Idea
The Digital Communications Commission (DCC) on Wednesday approved the penalty imposed on Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea amounting to ₹3,050 crore (cumulative) for not providing points of interconnection to Reliance Jio. 
The decision comes after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) recently maintained its stand that t is not in a position to modify its previously recommended penalty on the operators as it is bound by the provisions of the TRAI Act.
“The DCC has accepted TRAI’s recommendation on penalty on Airtel and Vodafone Idea. It will send the same recommendation to the competent authority in the government for its decision,” Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary, Department of Telecom (DoT), told reporters here.
In October 2016, TRAI had recommended imposing a total penalty of ₹3,050 crore on Airtel, Vodafone and Idea (now merged) for allegedly denying inter-connectivity to Reliance Jio.
The DCC, the apex decision-making body of DoT, last month approved imposing a penalty on both the operators for not providing points of interconnection to Reliance Jio. But, before imposing the penalty, the Commission decided to seek TRAI’s views on revising the ₹3,050-crore suggested penalty, citing the ‘present financial health of the sector’.
Reacting to the latest development, both Airtel and Vodafone Idea said that they were disappointed with the decision to impose penalty. 
“This is despite the fact that the total number of POIs (points of interconnection) provided were more than sufficient for the projections provided on the number of customers. Further, the requested POIs were provided within the prescribed time limits and were more than the numbers requested for. All these facts were presented to the authorities. It is, therefore, disheartening that those facts have not been considered while taking this arbitrary decision of imposing the penalty,” an Airtel spokesperson said. 
Given the recent forced consolidation due to the financial stress that the sector is going through, this decision will impose an additional burden on the already stretched balance sheets of the operators, and will adversely impact the government’s vision of a digitally inclusive and empowered India, he said. 
“Upon receipt of the formal communication intimating the levy of penalty, we will approach the appropriate forum. We have complete faith in the judicial process and the law of the land,” he added."

Bharti Airtel posts loss for the first time in 14 years.
   -  Reuters


With stiff competition and tariff rates diving to minimum levels, telecom services provider Bharti Airtel has reported a consolidated net loss of ₹2,866 crore for the first quarter ended June, a first-time loss in the last 14 years.
The Gurugram-based company had reported a net profit of ₹97 crore in the corresponding period last year. The company has been reporting decline in its profits amidst stiff competition from Reliance Jio over the last three years.
However, total revenue of the company during the period grew by round 5 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to ₹20,738 crore from ₹19,799 crore in April-June quarter last year.
“The first quarter of the year has begun with a healthy and equitable growth across all our lines of businesses. Headline pricing remained stable, albeit at low levels. We continue to remain focussed on providing value to customers through our rewards platform, Airtel Thanks. This has led to the second consecutive quarter of average revenue per user (ARPU) increase,” Gopal Vittal, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, India and South Asia, Airtel said.
Overall customer base stands at 404 million across 16 countries as of June 30 and India mobile ARPU increased to ₹129 in the quarter, the company said, adding that total capex spend for the quarter stood at ₹5,047 crore.
“We remain obsessed about network experience. As a result, we have re-farmed spectrum from 3G networks to 4G across both the 900 and 2100 bands and begun the process of shutting down 3G networks in India. This has enabled us to deliver improved indoor coverage as well as enhance our capacities. Our underlying operational efficiency and customer-first mindset keeps us on track to grow our market share,” Vittal added.
Mobile revenues have witnessed a YoY growth of 3.7 per cent during the quarter and mobile data traffic has nearly doubled to 3,904 PBs in the quarter as compared to 2,003 PBs in the corresponding quarter last year, Airtel said.
Mobile 4G data customers increased by 63.3 per cent to 95.2 million from 58.3 million in the corresponding quarter last year. Non mobile businesses continue to perform well. Digital TV revenue witnessed a growth of 15.7 per cent YoY (decline of 25.5 per cent on reported basis due to reporting changes in DTH pursuant to the new tariff order, leading to content cost becoming a pass-through expense) on an underlying basis, it said.
“Airtel Business has witnessed a growth of 7.2 per cent YoY. Consolidated EBITDA at ₹8,493 crore increased 24.2 per cent YoY. Consolidated EBITDA margin increased by 6.4 per cent to 41 per cent in the quarter as compared to 34.5 per cent in the corresponding quarter last year,” it added.
Shares of Airtel closed at ₹323.95 a piece on the BSE on Thursday, down 4.10 per cent from the previous close."
59,2019-08-02,Airtel,"Airtel to shut entire 3G network by March
Bharti Airtel has said that it will shut its 3G services across India within this financial year.
The process has already been initiated in Kolkata – the first circle in the country where the company started its 4G services. “By September, 3G will be shut in 6-7 more circles,” a senior executive of the company said. 
He added: “Between December and March, it will be shut in the entire country.” The company said it is seeing customers moving from 2G to 4G directly. 
“We see an upgrade from people, from 2G to 4G. On the overall spectrum, we will have only 2G and 4G by April 2020. All our spectrum are on 4G other than the administered spectrum, which is on 2G, and that can be worked out based on the spectrum holdings we have,” said Gopal Vittal, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer – India and South Asia, Bharti Airtel, in a post earnings call with analysts on Friday.
He said that the company requires a small amount of spectrum to run its 2G networks, which will be anywhere between 5MHz and 8MHz (in 1800MHz and 900MHz). “Everything else would really be sitting on the 4G band,” said Vittal.
The decision was made in light of depleting 3G users and more offers on the 4G network. It is also due to the competition as Reliance Jio has been offering only 4G services since its launch in September, 2016. However, Vodafone-Idea still offers its services in 2G, 3G and 4G.
As of June 30, Airtel has 9.51 crore 4G customers out of a total data customer base of around 12 crore people. According to sources, it has around 70 lakh 3G customers across the country.
On the capex, the company said it has lowered the investments as compared to last year, but will continue to invest in its network business. 
“This is going to be a lower capex year than last year. Typically, you see a higher upfront capex in the first half of the year...it tends to be higher than the second half, but the capex will be moderate compared to last year,” said Vittal. On Thursday, the company reported a consolidated net loss of ₹2,866 crore for the first quarter ended June, the first time in the last 14 years. It had reported a net profit of ₹97 crore in the corresponding period last year.
According to analysts, lack of a counter to Jio phone and smaller 4G coverage [relative to Jio] remain key challenges for Airtel. However, it is making up for the gaps through strong execution. Network investments made over the last 12-18 months, smart content bundling and over the top (OTT) partnerships, and effective marketing are strengthening the perception that the company has a robust smartphone network.
“Bharti delivered a 2.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth in mobile revenues, diverging further from Vodafone-Idea Ltd (-4.2 per cent) and surpassing it to become the No 2 telco. Growth was driven entirely by average revenue per user (ARPU), which is up 3.1 per cent QoQ to ₹127 (VIL: ₹108), fuelled by smartphone upgrades (adoption of data bundles) and ARPU up-trading (laddered content bundles under Airtel-Thanks programme),” said a JM Financial analysis report.
Shares of Airtel closed at ₹343.45 apiece on the BSE on Friday, up 6.02 per cent from the previous close."

 Reliance Jio’s aggressive posturing has begun to show the divergent impact on telcos, with Vodafone Idea getting impacted sharply and Bharti Airtel holding on, a report said on Monday.
 The deep-pocketed Jio’s entry has so far impacted all the telcos, forcing mergers and also bankruptcy filings.
 For Vodafone Idea, it was the market share loss to Jio which proved to be the undoing and led to a weak numbers for the June quarter, Airtel could hold on, global rating agency Fitch said in a note.
The agency also estimated that Airtel to show operating profit growth in India this year on improvements in average revenue per user (ARPU), easing competition and cost savings.
It said Airtel’s operating profit grew 7 per cent during the June quarter as compared to the three months ending March on an ARPU growth and shift of more consumers to the 4G network.
 Vodafone Idea’s revenue slipped 4 per cent and operating profit was down 22 per cent during the same period, as it lost 14 million subscribers.
In comparison, Jio posted revenue growth of 44 per cent and 37 per cent growth in operating profit, it said.
 Internet experience is the key aspect which is influencing customers and not tariff where no differentials exist, it said, adding that Bharti and Vodafone-Idea are improving their 4G coverage.
 Going forward, telcos are likely to monetise their tower and fibre assets to deleverage and create financial flexibility, it said in the note that comes days after Jio announced a Rs 25,000 crore deal to sell tower assets to Brookfield."
57,2019-08-09,Airtel,"SingTel may raise its stake in Bharti Telecom
 Singapore-based telecom major SingTel may raise stake in Bharti Telecom, a promoter entity of Airtel, to more than 50 per cent, making the country’s first private telecom services provider a foreign entity.
Bharti Telecom is the single-largest shareholder in Bharti Airtel with about 41 per cent equity stake, according to the BSE data. Sunil Bharti Mittal and his family currently own around 52 per cent stake in Bharti Telecom.
“Bharti Telecom Ltd (promoter of Bharti Airtel Ltd), in order to retire some debt may seek equity from its existing promoter group (which may include its overseas entities) and SingTel in proportionate to its holding,” Bharti Airtel said in response to an e-mail query.
 “Even a marginal increase in foreign equity would take the foreign investment in Bharti Telecom above 50 per cent making it a foreign-owned entity. Once that happens, Bharti Telecom’s entire stake in Bharti Airtel Limited will automatically be considered as foreign investment,” Airtel said.
Foreign shareholding in Bharti Airtel is 43 per cent at present and after the proposed SingTel investment, the total foreign stake would increase to around 85 per cent.
According to sources, Bharti Airtel has, for the second time, applied for 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment approval offering clarity on the proposed investment.
 The Department of Telecom had earlier this year rejected Bharti Airtel’s FDI application as the company had not provided clarity on the foreign investor.
 “Bharti Airtel is committed to be compliant with regulatory regime for foreign investment and accordingly has applied for foreign investment for 100 per cent to keep further headroom for FII/FPI investments as well,” Airtel said.
With the proposed investment, SingTel is likely to hold around 52 per cent in Bharti Telecom which will effectively enhance foreign stakeholding in Bharti Airtel to around 85 per cent from 43 per cent at present.
SingTel, at present, holds around 35 per cent stake in Bharti Airtel.
Bharti Airtel is likely to use the SingTel investment to reduce its debt. Airtel’s consolidated net debt stood at ₹1,16,645.8 crore as on June 30."
56,2019-08-11,Airtel,"Bharti Airtel takes the right call
Since Reliance Jio’s entry in September 2016, there has been immense price disruption in the Indian telecom industry — with rock-bottom data tariffs and free voice services. The turmoil in the industry has led to a pile up of huge debt for existing telecom players and triggered consolidation, leaving three key players — Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio — to compete.
Bharti Airtel, which has been tackling subscriber erosion, increasing competition and tariff volatility, posted its first ever loss of ₹2,866 crore in the latest June quarter, since its listing. This was mainly due to exceptional item of incremental provisioning for derivative liabilities pertaining to indemnities provided to pre-IPO investors of Airtel Africa; operating costs on network re-farming; higher depreciation and forex losses.
However, the company’s strategy of focussing on fewer and better-paying customers, has helped topline performance. It registered growth in consolidated revenue of 5 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹20,738 crore in the latest June quarter. Operating margins also improved, from 34.5 per cent in the last June quarter to 41 per cent in the latest June quarter.
Going ahead, Airtel has set out a strategy to retain customers, drive up data usage and increase its average revenue per user (ARPU).








 
The company’s ARPU stood at ₹196, three years ago in June 2016. Intense price wars forced the company to reduce rates and the company’s ARPU had been on the decline since then.
However, Airtel moved its focus from quantity to quality of subscribers, leading to growth in ARPU since March 2019 quarter. The company introduced minimum recharge plans and increased its retail tariffs to wean out the non-paying customers.
Unlike its rival Vodafone Idea, Airtel was able to maintain its price premium. In the recent FY20 June quarter, ARPU grew 23 per cent Y-o-Y (5 per cent Q-o-Q growth) to ₹129. This is the highest ARPU across the three telecos in the market.
Airtel hopes to improve its ARPU further and focus on increasing digital consumption by its subscribers.
Also, to drive data usage, the company has taken a call to shut down its 3G network across all circles by the end of FY20.
To start with, it has terminated 3G services in the Kolkata circle in the June quarter, which is expected to free up network and ensure better capacity for 4G usage.
This is likely to increase the data consumption, boosting ARPUs.
Airtel has seen an increase in its data consumption per customer per month — it stands at 11.9 GB in the latest June quarter, compared to Jio’s data consumption of 11.4 GB.
The company has created a loyalty programme — Airtel Thanks. This is a rewards programme launched in September 2018 and offers access to rewards, perks and privileges.










Though Airtel’s customer base fell in the last three quarters, the trend is likely to be arrested in the coming quarter. There could be a modest growth in subscriber base, but increasing ARPU will be critical.
Despite the Airtel Thanks programme and the company’s strategy to push up ARPU through tariff tweaks, there could be some more volatility in tariffs. A rise in tariff could take some time as competitive pressure from Jio does not appear to be easing.
Also, Airtel’s debt is still high at ₹1,16,645 crore and the debt-equity ratio is 1.28 times. Though the balance-sheet of the company is better than Vodafone Idea’s (debt of ₹1,70,065 crore), pricing onslaught from Jio can continue to put pressure."

 In absolute terms, Vodafone Idea continued to lead the total subscriber tally at 38.34 crore, followed by Jio with 33.12 crore and Bharti Airtel with 32.03 crore.
 Vodafone Idea shed 41.45 lakh subscribers, and Bharti Airtel 29,883 customers during June, while the Jio continued to add customers at a breakneck speed.
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) data showed that Jio gained 82.68 lakh customers in June, higher than 81.80 lakh additions it had notched in May.
State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd - despite all its financial and operational woes - continued to gain subscribers in June as well. BSNL, which was the only mobile operator apart from Jio to add customers, gained 2.66 lakh users during June.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, which have introduced minimum recharge schemes in their quest to chase higher average revenues per user (ARPUs) and improve financials, have seen their subscriber base erode in the past months but the pace of subscriber loss appears to have slowed down in June.
For instance, Vodafone Idea had lost 56.97 lakh subscribers and Bharti Airtel 15.08 lakh users in May. 
 Jio’s entry into the market dented the financial metrics of the operators, deepening the impact of regulatory decisions like cut in termination charges, even though the voice and data usage per se have been growing at a scorching pace.

Airtel and Reliance Jio have started a fresh debate over the issue of bringing interconnect usage charges to zero. While Airtel wants the charges to be increased from 6 paise a minute to 14 paise, Reliance Jio wants it to be brought down to zero by January 2020. BusinessLine has put together the differences between the two sides on key questions related to IUC. 
Airtel’s view: Interconnect Usage Charge (IUC) is the cost that a mobile operator pays to another operator for carrying through/ terminating a call. If a customer of Mobile Operator A calls a customer of Mobile Operator B and the call is completed, then A pays an IUC charge to B for carrying/ facilitating the call. Essentially, it is the originating network compensating the receiving network for cost of carrying the call. In India IUC is set by the TRAI. It is currently at 6 paise/minute, with a roadmap to bring it down to zero by January 2020.
Reliance Jio’s view: IUC is nothing but a subsidy that new operators pay to incumbent operators, as incumbent operators have more customers and, therefore, receive more calls. It is also a subsidy that the more efficient operators pay to the less efficient operators. The less efficient operators charge higher tariffs from their customers, who, therefore, do not make outgoing calls but only receive incoming calls. 
In India, the operator who has spent over Rs 4 lakh crore in setting up a best-in-class network to reach the benefits of technology to all customers, and is actually providing free voice to all its customers, has been paying an IUC subsidy of hundreds of crores per month to incumbent operators, who continue to charge their customers high tariffs and do not want to invest in new technology. The incumbent operators have been manipulating the system to the detriment of the customers, so much so that in spite of the TRAI filing in the Supreme Court in 2012, the Bill and Keep regime has still not been implemented in India. 
Airtel’s view: IUC is like a clearing house. One operator pays another to carry the call on their network. All these calls are aggregated and then a settlement is done at the end of the month. 
Asymmetry of traffic: A situation where operator A receives, say, 100 calls from operator B, while operator B receives only 60 calls from operator A, would be a case of asymmetric or unequal traffic between two networks. At the end of the month, operator B compensates operator A for a net of 40 calls completed on its network.
Symmetry of traffic: If both operator A and B receive 100 calls from each other, then it would be a situation of symmetric or equal traffic between the two networks. In this case the payouts between the two operators are squared off.
Reliance Jio’s view: No difference of opinion
Airtel: IUC is determined by taking into account the cost of running a mobile network - rent for towers, the energy cost for running towers, spectrum costs and other such costs. The current IUC of 6 paise/minute is unable to cover these costs and the result is that most operators lose money while carrying calls from a 4G only operator that is now the country’s largest.
 Reliance Jio: All operators have had the chance to move to an IP framework for several years. IP-based voice calling (like VoLTE, OTT apps like Whatsapp, etc.) has near-zero cost. And, therefore, the benefit of technology must be passed on to the consumer. By not being able to upgrade legacy networks and continuing to exploit customers through 2G/3G call charges and holding them to ransom, incumbent operators continue to charge users Rs 1.50/minute for voice calls. On an IP-based network, the cost of voice is 0.05 paise per minute (as in the case of a WhatsApp call). Where is the need for IUC in such a case? The cost of old circuit switch networks may be higher. But then why do incumbent operators allow free calling on their own network (on-net calls)?
Airtel: Tariff has nothing to do with IUC, which is essentially a clearing system between two operators, for carrying the calls made by one operator on the network of the other operator. So, the key is to pay for the cost of using the other operator's network. India has the world’s lowest mobile tariffs (and below cost). This has led to unprecedented consolidation, with eight operators folding up and a mega merger between two large operators. If, indeed, tariffs were high, this would not have happened.
Reliance Jio: IUC is highly dependent on customer tariffs. If one operator charges a high price for voice calls (as incumbent operators do, charging at Rs 1.50 per minute), whereas another operator offers free voice calls, customers of the first operator are bound to give missed calls only and not complete calls, whereas customers of the more efficient operators would tend to make the calls. Therefore, the more efficient operator would end up paying IUC to the less efficient, costlier operator.
Airtel: No, it has nothing to do with the cost. This is because the cost of energy, rental and spectrum is common and has nothing to do with technology. Anyway, since all operators now have IP technology/ networks, this issue is irrelevant.
Reliance Jio: Airtel has only 18 per cent of its voice traffic and Vodafone only 5 per cent of its total voice traffic on IP. The inability to upgrade networks to 4G, and purposefully keeping subscribers on legacy 2G/3G networks to charge them Rs 1.50/min of call is not consumer friendly and is an artificial way to generate revenue.
Airtel: TRAI had clearly stated that they would assess the extent of migration of traffic to all IP networks and symmetry (balance) of traffic before finalising the reduction in IUC from 6 paise/ minute to zero. This was two years ago.
The ground reality is that there is still very high asymmetry of traffic between a large 4G only operator and the other operators. Despite Jio gaining more than 32 per cent market share, Airtel and Vodafone continue to be large net recipients of calls from Jio and, therefore, Jio pays them IUC for carrying these calls. Airtel’s traffic asymmetry with RJio still stands at approximately 65 per cent (incoming) versus 35 per cent (outgoing).
TRAI has taken this into account and started a fresh consultation process to ensure the orderly growth of the telecom sector.
Reliance Jio: It takes investment as well as technological advancement to be able to upgrade a network to 4G. Without having done that, there cannot be symmetry in traffic, as more than 65 per cent of incumbent customers are still on 2G/3G. Unfortunately, these customer do not even have the privilege of enjoying free voice calling. They end up paying exorbitant and excruciating rates for voice minutes (more than anywhere in the world), making India the lowest data rate market in the world, but the most expensive voice market.
Hence, incumbents want the IUC regime to continue, where they continue to monetise both their legacy network and their customers, who are artificially suppressed to remain on a legacy network (due to 2G/3G devices that have not reached end of life).
Airtel: Operators around the world follow a simple accounting standard, which uses established practices to decide what cost is capitalised in the balance sheet, and what is reflected in the profit and loss account. There are massive differences in the way this large 4G only operator in India does its accounting. So, the cost of a call must be determined according to globally established norms, rather than on the basis of the accounting practices of one particular operator.
Reliance Jio: It has been demonstrated to all authorities that the cost of carrying calls on an IP network is close to nil. Accounting standards have nothing to do with cost of carrying a voice call.
Take a simple example – any OTT call on your network, is simply using a few KBs of data. That is all you need to make a voice call.
How much does this incumbent operator charge its customers for a call done using WhatsApp? It effectively charges less than 0.05 paise per minute? Is that because this operator uses a different set of accounting standards when it deals with OTTs?
FYI, all leading telcos globally also offer free voice calls and have an IP-based network for doing so.
Further, the large 4G only operator follows the Indian Accounting Standards. It is a blatant lie to say that the large 4G only operator does its accounting in any different way.
Airtel: This could be true. For example, if one operator reduces the ringing time for outgoing calls to other networks (say from 45 seconds to 20 seconds only), it leads to a lot of customer inconvenience since the calls are cut-off even before the receiving customer has the time to pick it up.
Seeing a missed call, the receiving customer calls back to the originating operator’s network. By converting such outgoing calls to incoming calls, one large operator is not only (a) getting IUC from other operators, but also (b) trying to reduce the asymmetry of traffic artificially. This is to show symmetry in traffic in the run-up to the proposed implementation of zero IUC w.e.f. 1.1.2020.
Seeing this practice from a large 4G only operator, the TRAI has come out with a consultation paper.
Reliance Jio: Firstly, the incumbent operators have a ringing time of 30 seconds, as opposed to the false statement made above (about 45 seconds). 
Secondly, globally, most operators have an average ringing time of only 15–20 seconds – this includes Vodafone UK.
Third, 25-30 per cent of calls landing on the large 4G operator’s network are missed calls. Users from incumbents network who pay Rs 1.5/min for calls, request Jio users to make a free voice call to them by giving a missed call, thereby, creating this traffic mismatch. Incumbent operators create this mismatch and want to monetise it, too, by asking for 6p/min IUC revenue.
Fourth, if all operators were made to upgrade their networks to 4G and charge their customers at par, there will not be any traffic asymmetry.
It is actually the incumbent operators who are gaming the IUC regime by charging their 2G/ 3G customers high voice tariffs, as these customers are not able to move to the efficient 4G operator owing to not having a compatible device.
Airtel: This is not true at all, since spectrum efficiency has nothing to do with reduction in timer. If indeed spectrum efficiency was the reason, why has that large 4G only operator reduced the ringing timer (from 45 sec to 20 sec) for outgoing calls only to other networks, but kept it at 45 sec for calls made within its own network? It is quite evident that this has been done with the sole purpose of gaming the asymmetry of traffic and reducing IUC payouts to other operators.
Reliance Jio: All calls, including onnet and offnet in Jio, have a call ringing time of 20 seconds. This can be checked by anyone.
Airtel: You can look at the net IUC payments being made by that large 4G only operator to the other operators due to traffic asymmetry. If the IUC goes to zero, the said operator stands to benefit by approximately Rs 3,200-3,300 crore per annum.
RELIANCE JIO: It is a known fact that with a growing base of customers, more calls happen onnet than offnet. With the current growth rate for the large 4G operator, onnet calls will soon surpass offnet by a good margin. Therefore, the question of losing to IUC being made zero does not arise in the near future.
Regardless, the large 4G operator has always maintained that IUC should be scrapped, whether it stands to gain from it or not.
Airtel: This is again a classic case of obfuscation. Tariff has absolutely nothing to do with the cost of carrying a call. At any rate, that large 4G only operator's ARPU is higher than the industry average, showing clearly that many more low-income customers are on incumbent/other networks. If tariffs were higher for other operators, how could this be possible?
Reliance Jio: Through artificial suppression, incumbents have held more than 65 per cent of their customers hostage to high voice call rates of Rs 1.5/min. Because of this, their customers are unable to afford outgoing calls, let aside enjoy the benefits of free calling. These customers are not able to move to the efficient 4G operator owing to not having a compatible device.
Hence, these customers (more than 25-30 per cent of all calls landing on Jio), make missed calls to Jio users, asking them call back. This results in traffic asymmetry and leads to the large 4G operator paying higher net IUC.
Classic case of old-world/legacy mindset of monetising from the customer like they once did with data and even VAS services.
The fact that even low-value customer should be given the opportunity to make free voice calls @ Rs 49/month, as opposed to being charged even higher by incumbents (Rs 1.5/min) that gives them access to only 30 minutes of calls @ Rs 50, means the outgoing from these low-value customers on incumbent operators will be negligible."

 Telecom major Bharti Airtel is planning to raise funds up to $ 1 billion (about Rs 7,000 crore) via a bond issue by its subsidiary Network i2i, the proceeds of which will be used to reduce debt.
“...offering of $ denominated Guaranteed Subordinated Perpetual Securities (PERPS) by Network i2i Limited (a direct 100 per cent subsidiary of Bharti Airtel) expected to be rated BB by both S&P and Fitch may follow, subject to market conditions,” Bharti Airtel said in a regulatory filing.
 Bharti Airtel has appointed a clutch of bankers including BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, HSBC, J P Morgan and Standard Chartered Bank as joint book runners and joint lead managers to organise a series of fixed income investor meetings and calls across Asia, Europe and the US starting Wednesday, it added.
 Sources said that the fund raising is likely to be in range of $ 750 million to $ 1 billion, and the final figure will be arrived at based on the market response. The proceeds from the issue will be utilised for pruning debt of Bharti Airtel. Bharti Airtel’s debt stood at Rs 1.16 lakh crore as in June 2019.
 Meanwhile, S&P Global Ratings has said it expects Bharti Airtel’s leverage to remain elevated over the next six to nine months, but improve gradually due to reduced capital spending and increasing stability in its India mobile operations.
 “We assess Network i2i Ltd’s proposed $ 1 billion subordinated perpetual securities (PERPS) as having intermediate equity content. The PERPS are guaranteed by Bharti. We estimate the issuance will improve the India-based telecoms operator’s funds from operations to debt ratio by about 50 basis points,” S&P Global Ratings said."

RJio had cut the price of JioPhone at its last year AGM to Rs 500. File photo

Reliance Jio’s (RJio) move to drop entry-level phone price to Rs 699 and bundle it with data could hit incumbent operators, according to analysts.
“The offer clearly targets non-data/2G subscribers of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (VIL), which stand at 42 per cent and 52 per cent,(of their total user base) respectively. The move is negative for both Bharti and VIL, and historically VIL has been more susceptible to market share losses,” said a research report by Emkay.
RJio is now offering its entry level JioPhone at Rs 699 as against the original price of Rs 1,500 under a special offer. In addition to this, the customers will also get data benefits valued at Rs 700. Jio will add Rs 99 worth of data for the first 7 recharges by the customer.
“Any aggressive promotions by Jio can be negative for Bharti and Vodafone Idea. With this promotional offer, we believe Jio is continuing to focus on the feature phone segment to drive its growth. The recent move by Jio also reduces hopes of tariff increase in the near term with Jio still being in market share 'grab' phase,” Credit Suisse said in a research report.
RJio had cut the price of JioPhone at its last year AGM to Rs 500. However, it still entailed an upfront commitment of Rs1,095 from the customer. As part of the current promotional offer, Jio seems to have done away with the requirement of upfront recharges and the exchange of old phones effectively reducing the upfront commitment to Rs 699."
46,2019-10-02,Airtel,"Why the call ring duration matters to Airtel, RJio
Airtel and Reliance Jio are fighting each other over how much time your phone should ring before it gets disconnected, if you don’t pick up an incoming call. While Airtel used to allow the ringing to go on for 40 seconds, it has now decided to cut it short to 25 seconds. Reliance Jio has been disconnecting calls after 20-25 seconds.
If you think that this is being done for the consumer’s benefit, then you are wrong. The real reason is that the ring duration has an impact on the operator’s revenue. Here is how.
For example, if a Reliance Jio user calls an Airtel customer and Reliance Jio reduces the ringing time for outgoing calls to 20 seconds only, the calls may be cut off even before the Airtel customer has the time to pick it up.
Seeing the missed call, the Airtel customer calls back to Reliance Jio’s network.
So, for Reliance Jio, what started as an outgoing call, has been converted into an incoming call. In India, operators pay inter-operator fee, technically known as Interconnect Usage Charges. This charge is paid by the operator on whose network the call originates, to the operator on whose network the call terminates. So, in the above example, instead of Reliance Jio paying the fee, it now starts earning the fee, because of the shorter ring duration."

Bharti Airtel is an Indian telecommunications provider promoted by Sunil Mittal in 1984. It is the third-largest provider of mobile telephony services in India after Jio and Vodafone Idea. 
In the recent past, Reliance Jio had disrupted the telecom market by its low-cost products which brought a wave of changes in this industry since its launch. However, Airtel responded to the business in a positive manner by not offering any freebies, in fact, it has made many changes to its plan to increase the revenue which will add up to its profitability. 
Performance highlights — FY19: a) Bharti Airtel, reported Gross Revenue of ₹80,780 crore during FY19, down 2.2 per cent percent from ₹82,639 crores during FY18; b) Profit after-tax declined by 16.2 per cent to ₹24,828 crore in FY19 against ₹29,626 crore in FY18; c) It has paid dividend consistently for many years, with the dividend yield rising to as high as 244 per cent in FY19 as against 194 per cent in FY18 and 11 per cent in FY17.
Outlook and valuation: Despite tough competition in the telecommunications industry, Airtel is one company which has managed to stay strong. They have focussed on increasing their ARPU by measures such as introduction of minimum commitment plans, focus on digital innovations and offering differentiated services to its premium customers. We can see the stock scale to new highs even approaching its all-time high ₹500."

 High spectrum price and cost of deploying networks are expected to take take a toll on debt-ridden telecom sector, a senior official of Bharti Enterprises said on Monday.
 Bharti Enterprises Vice Chairman Rakesh Bharti Mittal while speaking at India Mobile Congress 2019 said 75 per cent of cost of deploying optical fibre in the country for high speed broadband is the fees charged by local authorities.
 “Current reserve price is seven times higher than the global peers’ When we look at the entire ecosystem that needs to be built, user cases for 5G technology needs to be built. This high price coupled with more capex deployment on sites and fibre is going to take a toll on telecom sector,” Mittal said.
 He said currently average revenue per user in telecom sector in India is around $ 1.5 compared to $ 36 in the US and $ 6.5 in China. “In spite of that, capex spent is same, at par with what global telcos are spending. 34 per cent is being spent on capex and Airtel last year had spent 40 per cent of total revenue in capex deployment.
 “Globally, the average is sub-20 per cent. This itself brings lot of stress on telcos to not only keep on serving customers while providing good quality but also keep on spending on capex as the database grows and as the demand for data is phenomenal,” Mittal said. He said litigation in the sector is also adding to the woes of the industry.
 “We need to improve ease of doing business. There is about Rs 1 lakh crore worth of litigation that needs to be settled. GST credit needs to be unlocked. We need to have more conducive regulatory environment,” Mittal said."

 Telecom operator Bharti Airtel said rates of mobile services are unsustainable and need to be increased.
Airtel MD and CEO for India and South Asia, Gopal Vittal also snubbed Reliance Jio’s move to charge 6 paise per minute for voice calls made by its users on other networks, saying interconnection usage charges are not part of tariff but clearing charges among operators to transmit calls. 
Jio has however said it will compensate users by giving free data of equal value. “We believe tariffs are unsustainable. We believe tariffs need to go up. We have always maintained this stand,” Vittal said on the sidelines of India Mobile Congress.
Responding to a media query on Reliance Jio’s move he said, “IUC has nothing to do with tariff. It is a clearing house, cost of carrying calls. It is a bilateral thing settled among carriers. Over the last 20 years , IUC has always been absorbed.” 
Vittal also said spectrum cost proposed for the next round of auction is also very high and unaffordable to do 5G business. He said telecom industry needs to be vibrant and healthy to meet aspirations of Digital India programme.
“If investments don’t come in this industry, we will not meet the aspirations that Digital India has. In the last five years, the investment that has happened in this industry needs to be put back again in the next five years. Investment climate and investment must be attractive for investors. This means investors should get return on what they invest,” Vittal said adding that telecom sector should be healthy enough to attract good talents.
To achieve the desired results, it is time to wear two hats — one for the company and the other for the country, he said, noting that telecom sector can bring in revolution if the stakeholders change their approach towards solving problems."

Worry about the unfolding story in India’s telecom sector kept some of the largest fund managers and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) awake during the Diwali weekend. This is after the Supreme Court (SC) on October 24 set a three-month deadline for telecom companies to pay their licence and spectrum dues to the government, which came as a shocker to most, as not many were expecting the court to set such a stiff deadline, a foreign fund manager investing in India told BusinessLine.
Market experts are expecting large telecom companies to default on their payment if the deadline is not extended by the government. Such a scenario could yet again affect banks that have lent money to telecom companies, experts said. Two foreign fund managers whom BusinessLine spoke to said they were not expecting the SC to set any deadline on payment of dues but only decide on the amount and hence, were surprised with Thursday’s order.
On Tuesday, as the market opened for trading after the long weekend, the share prices of Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel and Vodafone Idea took a pounding. While key indices Sensex and Nifty were trading with gains of around 1.5 per cent, the share price of Vodafone Idea, at about 1 pm, was trading nearly 10 per cent lower at Rs 3.8. The share price of Bharti Infratel, the largest telecom tower company, was down 8.15 per cent at Rs 194, while Bharti Airtel was down 5 per cent at Rs 353. The only exception among these telecom companies was the share price of Reliance Industries (RIL), which runs India’s largest telecom operator RJio. RIL’s share price was trading with gains of 2.8 per cent at Rs 1,474. RIL, on Friday, announced a plan to make its telecom arm RJio debt-free, which market experts say came at very opportune time considering the SC order was damaging for the telecom sector.
“We give (telecom companies) three months’ time to deposit the amount, which is due and compliance be reported,” said the court order uploaded on its website on Friday.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel will be affected most by the SC order with pending licence fee and spectrum usage charge (SUC) dues of Rs 39,000 crore and over Rs 41,000 crore, respectively. Tata Teleservices, which sold its loss-making consumer mobility business to Airtel, faces dues worth nearly Rs 13,000 crore. Reliance Jio, the latest entrant in the sector and is the only profitable telco, faces licence fee and SUC dues of Rs 41 crore.
The worry is, whether the government, on account of the SC order, will declare these large groups defaulters if they fail to pay on time. It is learnt that one of the promoters of a large conglomerate has sought a meeting with highest ranking government officials and ministers. It remains to be seen if the government will delay the deadline, said a foreign fund manager investing in India for more than two decades.
Fund managers worry that if telecom companies are labelled as defaulters, the hit will have to be taken by some large banks, which could yet again vitiate the stock market and investment scenario in the country. Banks though hold pledged shares of group companies linked to the telecom company, fund managers said. These pledged shares could now become vulnerable.
The fear is that the government will soon issue demand notices to telecom companies for additional licence fees and SUC after the SC order. But fund managers, clueless on how the scenario will unfold, are just selling telecom shares or continuing with their short positions in Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Infratel, the three most vulnerable companies for now."

Shares of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel jumped up to 8.5 per cent on Wednesday amid reports of the Government has constituted a panel to work out a bailout package for the telecom sector.
As the telecom sector stares at a massive payout following a Supreme Court order, the Government has created a Committee of Secretaries to work out a financial bailout package that may include lowering of spectrum charges as well as ending the era of free mobile phone calls and dirt cheap data.
Shares of Vodafone Idea zoomed 8.57 per cent to Rs 4.18 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
Likewise, Bharti Airtel also gained 3 per cent to Rs 370.80.
The Committee of Secretaries has been asked to examine “all aspects” of “financial stress” faced by service providers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea and suggest measures to mitigate them, sources in the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) said.
The panel, which will comprise of secretaries to the ministries of finance, law, and telecom, has been asked to look at the demands of telecom service providers (TSPs) for deferment of payments they had promised for the spectrum won through auction as well as consider lowering airwave usage charge.
While older TSPs such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea have been talking of financial stress ever since they faced intense competition from free voice and dirt-cheap data from newcomer Reliance Jio, the matter has assumed greater importance after the October 24 judgment of the Supreme Court.
Shares of Bharti Airtel on Tuesday fell over 3 per cent after the company deferred the September quarter result announcement till November 14, due to the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) issue."

36,2019-11-02,Airtel,"SC ruling on AGR: Telcos will have to pay ₹1.3-lakh crore 


TDSAT’s order could be a major relief for Airtel and Vodafone Idea which had challenged the TRAI amendment




TDSAT’s order could be a major relief for Airtel and Vodafone Idea which had challenged the TRAI amendment




 Incumbent telecom operators, including Airtel and Vodafone Idea, will have to cough up nearly ₹1.3 lakh crore after the Supreme Court dismissed their plea seeking a review of what constituted adjusted gross revenue (AGR). 
The biggest impact will be on Vodafone Idea, which will have to pay dues of around ₹40,000 crore while Airtel will have to pay ₹35,000 crore. There will be not be any significant impact on Reliance Jio. 
It is not clear how the balance ₹65,000 crore will be recovered by the Department of Telecom as most other operators, including Aircel, Tata Teleservices and Reliance Communications, have shut shop. 
The crux of the entire issue is what constitutes the operator’s AGR. Operators have to pay a part of their annual AGR as licence fee and spectrum usage charge. This arrangement was put in place in 1999 as part of a migration plan. The operators had bid astronomical amounts to acquire spectrum and then sought relief. 
Under the 1999 migration plan, operators agreed to pay annual revenue share instead of an upfront fee. A few years later, the operators claimed that they are liable to pay revenue share only on income generated from telecom services. The DoT opposed this claim and wanted a share of income from non-licenced activities as well. The operators went to court and stopped paying revenue share on the disputed amount. 
Upholding the DoT’s view, the Supreme Court on Thursday said that except for income from termination fee and roaming charges, operators have to pay revenue share on all other income. 
 “The conduct of the licensees has also to be considered in the backdrop of the fact that the regime of revenue sharing was extremely beneficial than the previous regime of the fixed licence fee. When Government has parted with the privilege as to revenue on sharing basis under the license, and an agreement entered into, it ought to have been precisely followed,” the court said in a 153-page ruling, adding that there was no ambiguity on the meaning of revenue.
“Once the contract has been entered into, the definition of gross revenue is binding, and the licensees cannot try to wriggle out of the decision by making impermissible attempts to depart from it. Given the definition of gross revenue, the same includes revenue from activities beyond the licence,” the three-judge bench said.
While the actual balance due from telcos is around ₹23,000 crore, DoT has slapped a penalty, with interest on the original amount. On the question of waiving the penalty and interest, the court said, “No litigant can be permitted to reap fruits on such inconsistent and untenable stands and litigate for decades in several rounds which is not so uncommon but is disturbing scenario projected in very many cases.”
The ruling comes at a time when both Airtel and Vodafone Idea are struggling under huge debt. “The Supreme Court’s judgement is the last straw in contributing to financial distress. It remains to be seen whether the industry will be able to recover from this,” said Rajan S Mathews of COAI."

Telecom operator Bharti Airtel  on Tuesday has deferred its second quarter (July-September) and half yearly results to be announced today to November 14, as more clarity was needed on the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) following the recent Supreme Court verdict.
""The Board of Directors, in its meeting held today, has accepted the management's recommendations and deferred the agenda item relating to the approval of the said financial results till Thursday, November 14,"" Airtel said in a filing to the stock exchanges.
""The company is approaching Department of Telecommunications to seek clarity on the total amounts involved and request for their support to deal with this adverse outcome,"" it added.
Airtel further said that all other agenda items will be taken up by the Board in the meeting to be resumed on Tuesday in the ordinary course.
The Supreme Court in its verdict on October 24, had upheld government contention that non-core revenue in telecoms groups should be included in AGR -- the figure on which statutory levies are charged.
 




 
Since then Airtel and Vodafone-Idea India (VIL) are having sleepless nights as both put together have a liability of around ₹75,000 crore (Airtel - ₹35,000 crore and VIL- ₹40,000 crore) to be paid to the government. The dues are on account of penalty and interest on licence fee unpaid by the operators.
However, as per VIL, the company has an outstanding amount of ₹28,309 crore to be paid to the DoT. But, the company also said, ""We cannot presently comment on the correctness and completeness of the aforesaid figures. The company is studying the judgement and we will evaluate our next steps.""

""The judgement has financial implications, which we are reviewing. We will engage with the DoT in order for it to consider granting relief, including a waiver of interests and penalties,"" VIL said in a filing in BSE said. The company is yet to announce the date of its quarterly and half yearly results.
Meanwhile, Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman, Bharti Airtel on Monday met top government officials including Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash, over the issue.
Both Airtel and VIL are now looking at the government for a possible relief such as waiver of penalties and interest though the Supreme Court had categorically stated that companies must pay many years worth of charges plus interest and penalties.
Sources said that Kumar Mangalam Birla, of VIL has also sought a meeting with Prasad and other senior officials at the earliest. VIL
According to analysts, Airtel may report a consolidated net loss of ₹1,700 crore. However, quarter on quarter (QoQ) consolidated revenue and EBITDA are seen at 0.9 per cent QoQ to ₹21,000 crore and 0.6 per cent QoQ to ₹8,400 crore, respectively.
""Bharti is likely to report flattish mobile revenue on acquisition of Tata Tele well enforced from July, adding Rs.150 crore in revenue...Bharti will see a small dip in subscribers (LTL), and continued growth in mobile broadband subs,"" said ICICI Securities in its report earlier this month.
Average revenue per user (ARPU) for the company is expected to be down 1 per cent QoQ, negatively impacted from Tata Tele subscribers addition, which has a much lower ARPU, the analysts said adding that they expect mobile broadband subs net addition of around 8 million for Airtel.

In the first quarter ending June 30, Airtel had reported a consolidated net loss of ₹2,866 crore, a first time loss in the last 14 years. It had reported a net profit of ₹97 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. However, total revenue of the company during the first quarter had grown by around 5 per cent to ₹20,738 crore as compared with ₹19,799 crore in April-June quarter 2018.
It had an overall customer base of 404 million across 16 countries as of June 30 and India mobile ARPU increased to ₹129 in the first quarter. Mobile revenues had witnessed a YoY growth of 3.7 per cent during the quarter and mobile data traffic had nearly doubled to 3,904 PBs in the quarter as compared to 2,003 PBs in the corresponding quarter last year.
Mobile 4G data customers increased by 63.3 per cent to 95.2 million from 58.3 million in the corresponding quarter last year. Non mobile businesses continue to perform well.
The company management during its Board meeting is also expected to comment on the ongoing debates around interconnect usage charges (IUC). While, TRAI has recently floated a consultation paper to study whether the original deadline of introducing zero interconnect rate should be delayed from January 1, 2020.
But, for now, the major issue is around the AGR for which the companies have to get a clarity from the DoT as the ball is in their court now."

Telecom service providers would have to pay penalties and interests to the DoT.


 
The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Centre’s plea to recover adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of about Rs 92,000 crore from telecom service providers.
A three-judge bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra, upheld the definition of the adjusted gross revenue formulated by the Department of Telecom (DoT).
“We have held that the definition of AGR will prevail,” the bench, also comprising Justices Vineet Saran and S Ravindra Bhat, said.
“We have allowed the appeal of the Department of Telecom and dismissed that of licensees (telcos),” the top court said while reading the operative portion of the judgement.
The apex court said it had rejected all other submissions of the telecom companies. It added that the service providers would have to pay penalties and interests to the DoT.
The bench made it clear that there would no further litigation on the issue and it would fix a time frame for calculation and payment of dues by the telecom companies."

 The telecom department has directed all circle heads to treat Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices as separate entities, as it is in process to challenge their merger in the Supreme Court, according to an official source.
 The Department of Telecom (DoT) has also asked all its entities to deal customer acquisition process and all compliance related issues of both the companies as separate companies.
“The department has written to all telecom circles heads on November 6 that it has not yet taken on record the transfer or merger of the demerged undertakings of TTSL to Bharti Airtel and Bharti Hexacom and transfer or merger of the demerged undertakings of TTML to Bharti Airtel,” an official source said.
 Bharti Airtel on July 1 announced that the consumer mobile business of Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTSL) has now become its part.
“The DoT has written that it is in process of two separate special leave petitions before the Supreme Court,” the source said.
The department, in the communication to the circle heads, asked them to audit customer acquisition form of both companies separately and even the compliance related to subscriber base should be handled separately.
“DoT has directed circle heads that there should be segregation of CAF audit process of Airtel and Tata Teleservices such as submission of separate subscriber database, submission of separate sampled CAF’s, calculation of separate compliance percentage and issuance of separate demand notice for imposition of penalty of Airtel and Tata Teleservices,” the source said.
 Bharti Airtel has been submitting Tata Teleservices subscriber base as part of its overall customer base July onwards.
 When contacted, Bharti Airtel spokesperson said both the parties have operationalised the merger following the telecom tribunal TDSAT’s (Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal) order directing the DoT to take the merger on record and approval of the schemes of arrangement by the NCLT, Delhi and NCLT, Mumbai.
“The DoT was duly notified of the same. The Registrar of Companies has also taken the merger on record. Needless to say, Bharti Airtel adheres to the highest standards of corporate governance and compliance,” the Airtel spokesperson said.
 In June, Airtel recorded mobile subscriber base of 320 million and Tata Teleservices 10.7 million. In July, Airtel reported mobile subscriber base of 328.5 million which includes customer base of Tata Teleservices as well."

Debt-ladden Reliance Communications (RCom), which is going through insolvency proceedings, has received bids from about three firms including Sunil Mittal-controlled Bharti Airtel and PE firm Varde Partners for its assets that are up for sale. RCom has total secured debt of about ₹33,000 crore.
However, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) has not placed its bid and has sought a 10-day extension. Bharti Infratel is the other company that has placed a bid, according to sources close to the development.
The deadline for submitting the bids ended on November 11. RCom’s Committee of Creditors (CoC) is scheduled to meet tomorrow to take a call on opening of the bids. It will also decide whether to give Jio more time to submits its offer. The CoC comprises about 40 lenders, including the State Bank of India, the China Development Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.
When contacted, a Bharti spokesperson said that a conditional bid has been made primarily for the spectrum, which is a precious asset.
“The bid conditions include that the overall consideration will primarily be by way of the deferred spectrum payables to the government being passed on to us on terms and schedules applicable to such deferred payments,” he added.
While Jio did not comment on the issue, a mail sent to Anish Niranjan Nanavaty, Resolution Professional (RP), for RCom’s bankruptcy process, did not elicit any response.
Earlier in October, the RP, who chaired RCom’s Annual General Meeting (AGM), said that the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had extended the date for completion of the asset-sale process by three months, and now the date to complete the process is January 10, 2020. 
RCom’s assets include spectrum, tower, fibre, ‘media convergence nodes’ and real estate, which are housed under its subsidiaries Reliance Telecom and Reliance Infratel. 
In December 2017, Mukesh Ambani had emerged as the white knight and announced the acquisition of the debt-laden RCom through RJio, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries. Later, in March this year, RCom and Reliance Industries mutually called off that deal, citing lack of regulatory approvals."

A day after Vodafone Plc’s Chief Executive Officer cast doubt over the future of its India operations due to massive financial stress, the Department of Telecom has issued notices to all operators asking them to pay up their licence fee dues as per the Supreme Court ruling on the issue of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR).
The DoT has asked all operators, including Internet Service Providers and Virtual Network Operators, to do a self-assessment of their respective dues as per the licence conditions, a top official told BusinessLine.
Industry experts said that the DoT should have calculated the dues owed by various operators instead of asking the telecom companies to do a self-assessment.
 




 
The DoT had submitted a document in the Supreme Court which stated that about 16 operators owed ₹92,000 crore.
It had given operator-wise break up of dues, penalties and interest levied.
However, latest estimate shows that a total of 41 companies would have to shell out nearly ₹2.27 lakh crore, including penalties. British telecom company Vodafone Plc on Tuesday had warned that its joint venture with the Aditya Birla Group, Vodafone Idea, could be facing liquidation if it does not get financial support from the Government. Vodafone has called for the dues demanded by the court to be spread over 10 years.
According to an earlier estimate, Vodafone Idea has to pay around ₹28,000 crore and Airtel has to cough up about ₹20,000 crore.
Operators have to pay a part of their annual AGR as licence fee and spectrum usage charge.
The operators had claimed that they are liable to pay revenue share only on income generated from telecom services.
The DoT opposed this claim and wanted a share of income from non-licenced activities as well. The operators went to court and stopped paying revenue share on the disputed amount. Upholding the DoT’s view, the Supreme Court said that except for income from termination fee and roaming charges, operators have to pay revenue share on all other income.
The DoT’s notice makes one thing clear that the impact of the top court’s decision is not restricted to telecom companies but also a number of public sector units holding Internet service licences such as GAIL India, Power Grid Corporation, Oil India, Delhi Metro and RailTel."

Vodafone Idea plunged 21.62 per cent to Rs 2.90, its record low, on the BSE. Bharti Airtel also fell 4.88 per cent to Rs 350.50.
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has issued notice to telecom operators to pay their revenue share dues within three months as directed by the Supreme Court, according to an industry source. The DoT has given option to telecom operators to clear all the dues on self-assessment basis.
The Supreme Court in its last month’s ruling said, “we give three months’ time to deposit the amount, which is due and compliance be reported.”"

Telecom operator, Bharti Airtel Ltd (Airtel), on Thursday reported a consolidated net loss of ₹23,045 crore in the second quarter ended September 30, its highest-ever loss, as compared to a net profit of ₹119 crore reported in the corresponding period last year.
However, consolidated revenue in the July-September quarter grew by 5 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to ₹21,131 crore, as against ₹20,148 crore in the same period last year.
The Sunil Bharti-owned company had delayed the announcement of its results from October 29, due to the ongoing issue on the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), post the order from the Supreme Court.
On October 24, the Supreme Court delivered a judgement in relation to a long outstanding industry-wide case, upholding the view of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in respect of the definition of AGR.
The judgement had significant financial implications for the company, Airtel said, adding that it was hopeful of relief, and in the absence of the same, has provided for an additional charge aggregating to ₹28,450 crore for the quarter (comprising principal of ₹6,164 crore, interest of ₹12,219 crore, penalty of ₹3,760 crore, and interest on penalty of ₹6,307 crore) with respect to the licence fee as estimated, based on the Court judgement, and spectrum usage charges (SUC) as estimated, based on the definition of AGR.
“Despite being a seasonally weak quarter, we witnessed positive revenue growth in the second quarter, on the back of various initiatives aimed at providing superior differential services through our Thanks platform. We continue to witness strong data traffic growth of around 81 per cent YoY and added around 8 million 4G customers on our network during the quarter,” Gopal Vittal, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, India & South Asia, said.
“On the AGR verdict of the Supreme Court, we continue to engage with the government and are evaluating various options available to us. We are hopeful that the government will take a considerate view in this matter, given the fragile state of the industry,” he added.
India revenues for the quarter in review stood at ₹15,361 crore, which have increased by around 3 per cent YoY on an underlying basis. Mobile revenues have witnessed YoY growth of 7 per cent, it said.
Mobile data traffic has nearly doubled to 4,497 petabytes (PBs) in the quarter, as compared to 2,478 PBs in the corresponding quarter last year. Mobile 4G data customers increased by 57 per cent to 103.1 million from 65.7 million in the corresponding quarter last year.
The average revenue per user (ARPU) during the quarter increased to ₹128 in mobile services, as against ₹100 in the corresponding quarter last year.
As of September 30, the customer base stood at 411 million across 16 countries. In India, the overall customer base stood at 3,04,703, down 13 per cent YoY, as against 3,51,539 as of September 30 in the previous year.
Digital TV revenue witnessed 17 per cent YoY growth on an underlying basis (decline of 23 per cent) on a reported basis, due to reporting changes in DTH pursuant to the new tariff order.

The future of Sunil Bharti Mittal’s and Kumar Mangalam Birla’s telecom empire is looking bleak with Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea reporting second-quarter losses that together amount to over ₹73,000 crore.
While Airtel reported its highest-ever loss of ₹23,045 crore compared to a net profit of ₹119 crore in the corresponding period last year, Vodafone Idea recorded a loss of ₹50,921 crore, the highest-ever loss for a corporate in India.
Tata Motors held that record after posting a loss of ₹26,961 crore for the third quarter of 2018.
Both operators have made provisions to pay Adjusted Gross Revenue dues to the Centre following an adverse ruling by the Supreme Court.
Airtel has provided for an additional charge aggregating to ₹28,450 crore. Vodafone Idea has provisioned ₹25,677.9 crore for AGR payments.
The loss for Vodafone Idea would have been higher had it provisioned for the total estimated payout of about ₹44,150 crore.
Both operators said that they were hoping to get relief on AGR payments from the government. “We are in active discussions with the government seeking financial relief following the recent Supreme Court ruling,” said Ravinder Takkar, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Vodafone Idea.
This comes even as the Department of Telecom issued notices to all operators to deposit the licence fee dues per the SC ruling. The total dues for the entire industry are estimated to be over ₹2 lakh crore.
Analysts tracking the telecom sector said that if the government insists on collecting the dues without giving any relief, then a number of companies will have no option but to shut their operations. “Other than Reliance Jio, all the other operators will find it difficult to sustain operations with this kind of payout. Telecom, once the poster boy of reforms, is set for a huge crash if the government does not step in,” said an analyst.
But for the AGR provisioning, both Airtel and Vodafone Idea look to be stable in terms of their key operational metrics.
 




 
“Despite being a seasonally weak quarter, we witnessed positive revenue growth in the second quarter.
“We continue to witness strong data traffic growth of around 81 per cent YoY and added around 8 million 4G customers on our network during the quarter,” said Gopal Vittal, Airtel’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, India & South Asia.

For Vodafone Idea, the total income on a consolidated basis rose to ₹11,146.4 crore in the second quarter compared to ₹7,878.6 crore recorded during the same quarter last year.
The operator also revised its capex guidance for FY20 to ₹13,000 crore from ₹17,000 crore.
Though its subscriber base declined to 311.1 million from 320 million, total data volumes grew by 8.4 per cent to 3,492 billion MB compared to the last quarter."

In a major surprise, shares of the two telecom majors Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea rallied sharply on Friday despite both companies posting a record cumulative loss of ₹70,000 crore.
Interestingly, broking firms have given a 'buy' call on both these stocks expecting a bailout package from the government.
Bharti Airtel on the BSE gained 8 per cent to ₹393 after hitting a high of ₹398 and low of ₹354 on Friday. The stock of Vodafone Idea Cellular shot up 25 per cent to ₹3.68 and hit a high of ₹3.89 and low of ₹2.61. The company, on Thursday, reported consolidated loss of ₹50,921 crore in the September quarter, the highest ever loss posted by any Indian corporate on account of the liability arising out of the Supreme Court order in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) case.
Similarly, Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel made a provision of ₹28,450 crore as the Supreme Court recently upheld the government’s position on including revenue from non-telecommunication businesses in calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies.
Now, a share of that revenue has to be paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer. The company reported ₹23,045 crore loss for the September quarter on Thursday.
Motilal Oswal recommended a ‘buy’ on Bharti Airtel stating that the company has outperformed operationally by maintaining its 4G subscriber base and also revenue market share.
Even in the case of limited government relief, it may survive with a potential duopoly structure. The consequent strong growth potential could offset regulatory pressures, it said.
Recommending an upside of 16 per cent to ₹425, Motilal said rising EBITDA, deleveraging the balance sheet and improved free cash flow have protected the stock even during the adverse external scenario even while raising ffnds or paying penalties towards AGR case remains a concern.
Meanwhile, Ravinder Takkar, CEO, Vodafone Idea, in a conference call said the Supreme Court judgment on AGR would have significant implications on the telecom industry and that the company was in the process of filing a review petition.
The government was aware of the tremendous stress faced by telecom operators and was determined to see three private players and one public player in the telecom sector, he said. 
The company is making a recommendation to the government through the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI)."

The S&P BSE Telecom index jumped as much as 8.2 per cent, led by a more than 10 per cent surge in Vodafone Idea Ltd and over 7 per cent gain in Bharti Airtel Ltd.
The Supreme Court last month upheld a demand by the telecoms ministry that wireless carriers pay ₹92,000 crore ($12.89 billion) in overdue levies and interest within months. As two of the country's top three carriers, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel will have to pay a bulk of that money.

Bharti Airtel has withdrawn its bid to acquire the assets of Reliance Communications after lenders agreed to extend the deadline for submitting the bids by 10 days. The extension was given on the request of Reliance Jio. 
According to Airtel, such a move was unfair as the lenders had earlier rejected its request to extend the deadline. 
In a communication to the resolution professional handling Reliance Communication’s insolvency process, Airtel termed the decision to extend the deadline as unfair and biased. 
On October 31, Airtel had requested an extension of time to submit the resolution plan from November 11 till December 1.
This request was rejected by the Committee of Creditors. Airtel told the resolution professional that it was forced to submit its bid in haste to meet the deadline. 
However, the same CoC agreed to extend the deadline to November 25 after Reliance Jio sought 10 more days to submits its bid. 
Airtel has withdrawn its bid but not ruled out submitting a fresh resolution plan within the new deadline. 
Last week, RCom received bids including from Sunil Mittal-controlled Bharti Airtel and Bharti Infratel and PE firm Varde Partners for its assets including spectrum, tower, fibre, ‘media convergence nodes’ and real estate. RCom, which is undergoing insolvency proceedings, has a secured debt of about ₹33,000 crore.
Earlier in October, the RP, who chaired RCom’s Annual General Meeting (AGM), said that the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had extended the date for completion of the asset-sale process by three months, and now the date to complete the process is January 10, 2020.
RCom’s assets include spectrum, tower, fibre, ‘media convergence nodes’ and real estate, which are housed under its subsidiaries Reliance Telecom and Reliance Infratel.
In December 2017, Mukesh Ambani emerged as the white knight and announced the acquisition of the debt-laden RCom through RJio, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries. In March this year, RCom and Reliance Industries mutually called off that deal, citing lack of regulatory approvals."

18,2019-11-21,Airtel,"Will spectrum payment moratorium help Airtel, Vodafone Idea fix the financial mess? 
The spectrum payment moratorium announced by the Centre on Wednesday may help telecom operators, especially Vodafone Idea, to tide over near-term liquidity issues, but it may not move the needle in terms of improving the industry’s overall financial situation.
For spectrum bought via auctions, operators have the option of paying 25-50 per cent of the bid amount upfront to the government, with the remaining amount payable over 16 years (post an initial two-year moratorium), including 9.3-10 per cent rate of interest. This repayment amounts to $0.5 billion/$1 billion/$1.7 billion annually for Reliance Jio/Bharti/Vodafone Idea.
“With this announced two-year moratorium on such payments (in FY21 and FY22), Bharti and Vodafone Idea can potentially save $2 billion and $3.3 billion respectively over this period, amounting to 41 per cent and 52 per cent of their respective AGR-related liability. We do note that on this unpaid amount over two years interest will accrue, and thus the spectrum moratorium will not impact our implied value for the stocks,”said a report by Goldman Sachs Equity Research."
17,2019-11-22,Airtel,"AGR issue: Telcos may knock on SC’s door today
Telecom companies including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and Tata Teleservices may move the Supreme Court on Friday or Saturday in a plea against the apex court’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR) Order last month, seeking more time for payments and also waiving the penalties.
Several sources from the industry told BusinessLine that the plea has been prepared and finalised to move the apex court, seeking its intervention, as they can only do this within 30 days from the day of the SC’s Order (on AGR). 
The SC, in its Order on October 24, had rejected the claims made by the telecom operators on the issue of AGR on the ground that the operators had agreed to pay revenue share on all income, as part of a migration package in 1999. It had left the ball in Department of Telecom’s (DoT) court to decide and collect the AGR from the operators within three months. The demand by DoT includes interest, penalty and interest on penalty on the outstanding amount, which amounts to ₹92,641 crore (disputed actual demand is ₹23,189 crore, levy of interest of ₹41,650 crore, penalty of ₹10,923 crore and interest on penalty of ₹16,878 crore). In addition, the SC had allowed DoT to apply the same formula while collecting spectrum usage charge (SUC). This will lead to a payout of another ₹50,000 crore, taking the total to ₹1,40,000 crore. 
“The companies have to go for a plea against its Order to the Supreme Court for some respite, including more time on payments and waiver on interest penalties. They are optimistic about a new ruling,” an industry source privy to the matter said."
16,2019-11-23,Airtel,"Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea approach Supreme Court on payment of dues 
 The top telecom firms, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, have asked the Supreme Court to review a ruling forcing them to pay the bulk of outstanding government dues of $13 billion, media said on Saturday.
Last month's ruling gave telecom operators three months in which to pay overdue levies and interest, putting at risk the operations of both Vodafone Idea and Bharti.
Bharti and Vodafone Idea have filed separate review petitions in the Supreme Court and the court has yet to decide on admitting the petitions. The two firms did not immediately reply to emails from Reuters to seek comment.
In their filings, the companies seek review of the penalties and interest on the dues, and query why some revenue components should be included in calculations of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), on which the dispute centres, the paper said.
Telecom providers in India pay the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) 3% to 5% of their AGR in spectrum usage charges and 8% as licence fees. Companies have long argued that AGR should comprise just revenue accrued from core services, while the government says it should include all revenue, a position the Supreme Court upheld last month.
Officials of the DoT did not immediately respond to telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment. Telecom operators got some respite from the court ruling after India on Wednesday gave them until the end of March 2022 to pay for airwaves bought via auction."

Airtel has told the Supreme Court that there was no wilful default in the payment of licence fee in the form of Adjusted Gross Revenue.
In a review petition filed by the telecom operator, the operator has argued that since it had won five rounds of litigation previously, there was no justification for paying interest and penalty on the disputed amount. “The interpretation of AGR has been in dispute since 2003 before the expert bodies as well as the court. It is stated that since all those judgements were ruled in favour of the petitioner (Airtel), it has acted on the basis of the directions given in those judgements,” Airtel has said in its review petition before the Supreme Court. 
“A party shall not be penalised for an act of court, especially, when such a party has always succeeded in all rounds of litigation that have prevailed,” it added. 
Incumbent telecom operators, including Airtel and Vodafone Idea, will have to cough up nearly ₹1.3 lakh crore after the Supreme Court, in October, dismissed their plea seeking a review of what constituted adjusted gross revenue (AGR)."

In an attempt to tide over the crisis in telecom sector, incumbent operators Vodafone Idea (VIL) and Bharti Airtel hiked mobile tariffs by up to 42 per cent, effective December 3.
VIL, which posted its highest-ever net loss for a corporate in the country, hiked mobile tariffs by an average 20-30 per cent for its pre-paid services. In certain data schemes, the tariff increases were as high as 42 per cent.
The company has launched 16 new plans with various validities (2, 28, 84 and 365 days) and prices (ranging from Rs 49 to Rs 2,399), in an attempt to mitigate losses from Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) payout.
Earlier on November 18, Vodafone Idea had stated “acute financial stress” in the sector that required it to hike tariffs from December.
For the second quarter ended September 30, VIL posted a consolidated net loss of Rs 50,921.9 crore, impacted mainly by AGR provisions, the highest-ever for a corporate in India. For the comparable year-ago quarter, the country’s second-largest company by subscribers posted a net loss of Rs 4,973.8 crore.
VIL had provisioned Rs 25,677.9 crore for AGR payments, which is estimated to be about Rs 44,150 crore. This includes an estimated license fee of Rs 27,610 crore and Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC) of Rs 16,540 crore (with penalty and interest) for up to September 30.

Shares of telecommunication companies have been gaining after they announced plans to increase the cost of subscriptions to their customers.
Vodafone Idea (VIL) surged 14 per cent at ₹7.79 on the BSE on Monday, Bharti Airtel gained 3.67 per cent at ₹458.55 and Reliance Industries, which control the unlisted telecom unit Jio, rose 2.28 per cent at ₹1,586.3. In the last one month, VIL has jumped 81.16 per cent, Bharti Airtel 22.6 per cent and RIL 8.9 per cent.
VIL and Bharti Airtel have raised tariffs of their popular bundled prepaid plans by 25-41 per cent as well as the low-end plans by around 40 per cent. RJio has indicated hikes of a similar magnitude but its details are yet to be known. VIL also announced a new pricing plan for prepaid customers on Sunday, which would be effective December 3.
The tariff hikes announced by telecom companies on Sunday were “significantly higher” than expectations and are positive for companies’ share prices. The industry was expecting an across-the-board hike of 10-12 per cent.
Even as telecom firms are expected to benefit from the rise in tariffs, the brokerage firms expect more hikes to follow.
“The magnitude of the pre-paid unlimited plans, which was higher by about 22 per cent on average versus existing 28-day plans and 33 per cent on average for 84-day plans, was a surprise,” Goldman Sachs said in a report. “We note that these plans are largely targeted at feature phone users, and we were not expecting any tariff hikes for this segment,” it said. Following the announcement, the annual EBITDA of telecom companies could go up by $1 billion, the brokerage firm added.

“As all telcos are looking to raise tariffs at almost the same magnitude, we do not see any negative elasticity impact. In the past, we saw negative elasticity as consumers had the option to switch to other telcos,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in its note to clients. The brokerage firm, which expected more tariff hikes to follow, considers Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm (Reliance Industries) to benefit from the tariff hikes.
On Sunday, RJio said it will take a call on hiking rates but did not divulge the quantum of increase.
“Similar to incumbents, we think only select packs will have 40 per cent increase but popular ones could have 25-30 per cent. We think, the incremental 300 per cent benefit, which RJio is talking about, is by offering more data allowances,” said BofA.
It added, “Even after these hikes, we believe Jio will continue to be 15-20 per cent cheaper than the incumbent operators.”
“An average revenue per user (ARPU) increase of ₹25-30 from these price hikes (assuming some down-trading) and incremental EBITDA for the two companies work out to ₹8,000-9,500 crore and ₹7,000-8,500 crore, respectively,” said Kotak Institutional Equities Research in a note.
Edelweiss Research in a note said: “The price hike is a major positive and will accelerate industry revival.” It is imperative for Bharti and Idea to ramp up 4G subscriber additions to sustain revenue market shares, it added while maintaining ‘buy’ on Bharti with a target price of ₹425 and kept Idea still ‘under review’.
Bharti and VIL have strategised the plans to restrict down-trading as both have discontinued their existing 1GB/day plans, said Emkay Global. “Over the next few days, we expect Bharti and VIL to announce tariff changes in their postpaid plans as well,” it added. Emkay recommended a ‘buy’ call on Bharti Airtel and VIL with a price target of ₹507 and ₹8, respectively.

The Bharti Airtel  board on Wednesday approved the raising of $4 billion through equity dilution and debt funding, subject to the approval of shareholders and other regulatory approvals. The proceeds will be mainly used to fund its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, sources told BusinessLine.
The company said in a regulatory filing it will raise $2 billion through “one or more” QIP, public and/or private offerings of equity shares, compulsory convertible debentures and other convertible securities/warrants/ADR/GDR or a combination thereof.”
It also cleared the issuance of “unsecured and/or secured” FCCBs or other similar “security denominated in foreign currency (ies) or combination thereof,” in one or more tranches on a private placement basis, aggregating $1 billion. Additionally, it approved the issuance of redeemable non-convertible debentures along with warrants or other similar security in one or more tranches for an aggregate amount of up to $1 billion on a private placement basis or otherwise. The overall issuance under the last two categories will be $1 billion, it added.
The telco has already raised close to $10 billion over the past year, including the funds raised during the pre-IPO and post-IPO of Airtel Africa totalling around $2.5 billion, and the recent rights offer of around $3.5 billion.

The stock of leading telecom service provider Bharti Airtel rallied last week, thanks to the implementation of new tariff plans for its pre-paid mobile customers, who form 95 per cent of the company’s customer base.
Tariffs across voice and data services have gone up 15-41 per cent across various plans. This move comes on the back of telecom companies reporting record losses for the quarter ended September, after making provisions towards adjusted gross revenue (AGR).
Airtel reported losses of ₹25,222 crore in the first half of FY20. However, the company registered a revenue growth of 5 per cent during the same period, thanks to the focus on fewer and better-paying customers.
The recent tariff hikes can aid the top-line for the company and also cushion the impact of AGR."

Bharti Telecom, a promoter of Bharti Airtel, has sought the government’s nod for the infusion of Rs 4,900 crore investment from Singapore-based Singtel and other foreign entities, a move that would make the country’s oldest private telecom operator a foreign entity. 
The funds infusion will enhance foreign stakeholding in Bharti Telecom to over 50 per cent that will make it a foreign-owned entity, an official source aware of the development told PTI. Sunil Bharti Mittal and his family own around 52 per cent stake in Bharti Telecom, at present.
Bharti Telecom holds around 41 per cent stake in Bharti Airtel, while foreign promoter entities hold 21.46 per cent stake in the telecom firm. Public shareholders have around 37 per cent stake in the company. 
“Bharti Telecom has applied for infusion of Rs 4,900 crore in the company, which includes investments from Singtel and some other foreign investors. With this, Bharti Telecom will become a foreign entity as the majority stake will be held by overseas investors. DoT is expected to approve the investment this month,” the source said.
The Department of Telecom had earlier this year rejected Bharti Airtel’s FDI application as the company had not provided clarity on the foreign investor.
The total foreign shareholding in Bharti Airtel is 43 per cent at present. With promoter firm Bharti Telecom becoming a foreign entity, the foreign shareholding in the company would cross 84 per cent, the source said. Bharti Airtel has been in discussion with Singtel and other entities for funds infusion. 
The company in August had informed the stock exchanges that Bharti Telecom, in order to retire some debt, may seek equity from its existing promoter group, which may include an overseas entity and Singtel, in proportion to its holding. 
Bharti Airtel has said that even a marginal increase in foreign equity would take the foreign investment in Bharti Telecom above 50 per cent, making it a foreign-owned entity. 
Bharti Airtel has already applied to raise the FDI limit to 100 per cent in the company. 
The Bharti Airtel board last week approved a proposal to raise $3 billion through a QIP, stake sale and debt papers as the company owes AGR dues of Rs 43,000 crore to the government.
