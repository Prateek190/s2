69,2018-01-08,UltraTech,"UltraTech Cement net dives 31% on plant buy, higher depreciation
UltraTech Cement, an Aditya Birla Group company, reported a 31 per cent drop in net profit in the September quarter to ₹423 crore against ₹614 crore due to one-time investment in 21 million tonne per annum (mtpa) newly acquired JP Cement plants and higher depreciation.
Net sales increased 20 per cent to ₹6,840 crore against ₹5,708 crore in the same period last year.
Depreciation increased 56 per cent to ₹522 crore against ₹334 crore. Interest cost during the quarter almost doubled to ₹388 crore (₹150 crore) due to cost involving new cement plant acquisition.
The company's production capacity has gone up to 93 mtpa with addition of fresh capacity.
The acquisition will enhance the company’s footprint into high growth markets such as central India, Himachal Pradesh, eastern UP and coastal Andhra Pradesh where it has been focussing to increase its presence, said UltraTech Cement in a statement.
This being the first quarter of operations post-acquisition, the company has injected the much-needed working capital to improve and stabilise the quality of cement being manufactured at these plants. Towards this, initial one-time expenses were undertaken for improving efficiencies and plant maintenance, it said.
In parallel, new dealers have been appointed to penetrate into new markets and completed transition of the acquired cement plants to the ‘UltraTech’ brand, it said.
The company plans to invest ₹194 crore to put up a wall care putty plant of 4 lakh tonne to cater to the rising demand. The plant is expected to be commissioned in the second-half of FY-20."

UltraTech Cement, an Aditya Birla Group company, plans to set up a 3.5-million-tonne-per-annum integrated cement plant in Rajasthan with an investment ₹1,850 crore.
The plant is expected to commence commercial production by June 2020. The group’s bet on a new cement plant comes even when the current demand remains lacklustre and with production cost going up substantially with the Supreme Court banning use of pet coke and furnace oil in Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.
The board of directors has approved the setting up the plant at Pali in Rajasthan, the company said a statement on Saturday.
The plant is being set up in one of the fastest- growing markets in the country and the highest cement-consuming State in the North zone, it added.
UltraTech Cement is one of the few companies in the sector which has a strong balance sheet even after taking over 17 million tonnes of JP Group’s stressed assets for ₹16,100 crore.
The plant will cater to the Western Rajasthan market, where the firm does not have a significant presence.
With this expansion, the company will have a foot print across the country with 50 plant locations, along with 103 ready-mix concrete plants.




The Board also approved a proposal to increase investment limits by Registered Foreign Portfolio Investors, including Foreign Institutional Investors, from the existing 30 per cent of the paid-up equity share capital, to 40 per cent, it said.
This is subject to the approval of the shareholders and other statutory approvals. The increase will make available more space for the RFPIs to invest in the equity share capital of the company, the firm said."

73,2018-01-11,UltraTech,"It will take 3 months to re-brand, market Jaypee cement products
It will take at least another three months before UltraTech Cement re-brands and markets product from the recently acquired Jaypee cement plants, an official in the company told BusinessLine.
“There’s a significant quality difference in the cement produced by UltraTech and Jaypee. Also, coal supply issues have to be sorted out at these plants and it will take at least another quarter before production reaches market,” the official who did not wish to be named said.
In June, UltraTech closed its ₹16,189 crore acquisition of the cement plants of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd and Jaypee Cement Corporation Ltd.
These are spread across Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, with a capacity of 21.2 million tonnes.
After the acquisition, UltraTech has 18 integrated plants, one clinkerisation unit, 25 grinding units and seven bulk terminals, augmenting its grey cement manufacturing capacity to 93 million tonnes a year. This makes UltraTech among the largest cement producers globally.
The UltraTech takeover of the bulk of Jaypee’s assets hauled the latter from under its massive debt burden and working capital shortages at its cement plants.
The official at UltraTech said that the former Jaypee assets – now with the Aditya Birla group – are operating at about 10 per cent capacity, against an industry average of roughly 70 per cent. UltraTech’s operating revenues per tonne of cement produced will also be lower till the plants match in capacity utilisation.
At UltraTech’s annual shareholder meeting here on Tuesday, Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman, said it would take about three years before the acquisition – the largest deal so far in India – begins to boost the company’s earnings per share."

Profit before interest, depreciation and tax was up 18 per cent at Rs 1,328 crore (Rs 1,124 crore) in the corresponding period of the previous year despite increasing cost trends, primarily due to energy and logistics cost on account of increase in fuel prices, said the company in a statement on Tuesday.

UltraTech Cement (Outperformer)
CMP: ₹4,151.40
Target: ₹4,650
The acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates’ cement assets is timely and opportune as it would boost UltraTech Cement’s capacity by 32 per cent when capacity additions are becoming increasingly difficult. The move would strengthen UltraTech’s regional presence, particularly in the Satna and the AP clusters, where it had limited exposure. In addition, the two clusters are showing strong demand growth (above pan-India average), led by government spend on infra and low-cost housing, apart from a pick-up in rural housing. Furthermore, UltraTech’s efforts to driving cost efficiencies have improved profitability despite a weak pricing environment.
Helped by the acquisition, we expect UltraTech to post an earnings CAGR of 25 per cent over FY17-19E. Given the positive demand outlook, efficient operations and waning capacity additions in industry, we believe valuations are likely to remain rich."

cement

Concluding the largest asset resolution in the country, lenders consortium led by ICICI Bank has transferred part of the debt of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd and Jaypee Cement Corporation Ltd from a stressed account to an AAA-rated new company.
This comes after the Aditya Birla Group announced that it has completed the acquisition of JP Group’s cement plants for ₹16,189 crore, giving a major boost to the stressed asset sale undertaken by banks.
Chanda Kochhar, MD & CEO, ICICI Bank, said: “This is the largest asset resolution in the country so far, and I hope that this landmark transaction will pave the way for more such resolutions. It is also heartening to note that this is the largest transaction in India’s cement industry, thus far.”
As part of the deal, UltraTech will take over JP Associates debt of ₹12,000 crore along with ICICI Bank debt of ₹5,300 crore and get access to operate six integrated cement plants and five grinding units in Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh with total capacity of 21.2 million tonnes. JP Associates current debt stand's at ₹28,000 crore.
Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman, UltraTech Cement, said the acquisition is essentially for geographic market expansion, enabling the company’s entry into the high-growth markets of India.
Post the deal, UltraTech will have 18 integrated plants, one clinker unit, 25 grinding units and seven bulk terminals with cumulative capacity of 93 million tonnes per annum.
UltraTech Cement will become the fourth largest cement company in the world (excluding China) and largest in India with higher margin.
Creating synergies in manufacturing, distribution and logistics offer many advantages, said Birla, adding that economies of sale and reduced lead-time to market will be achieved to enhance competitiveness and benefit for customers, besides creating value for stakeholders, he said.
UltraTech announced its intention to take over the troubled JP Cement for ₹15,900 crore in March 2016, and earlier this year, the valuation was increased to ₹16,189 crore.
The closure of UltraTech-JP deal comes a week after banks clearing the ₹86,000-crore Rosneft-Essar Oil deal which will also help banks reduce their NPA. Essar Oil owed over ₹26,000 crore in debt to 23 lenders led by SBI, apart from a ₹1,290 crore to LIC."
65,2018-01-18,UltraTech,"UltraTech profit down 23% on higher input cost
UltraTech Cement, an Aditya Birla Group Company, has reported that its December quarter net profit dropped 23 per cent to ₹456 crore (₹595 crore) on the higher input cost.
Net sales were up 33 per cent at ₹7,897 crore (₹5,927 crore) on increased sales which went up 37 per cent to 15 million tonnes (11 mt).
The company’s capacity utilisation improved marginally to 69 per cent in December quarter compared to 67 per cent in the same period last year.
Its energy cost has increased 28 per cent to ₹949 a tonne and logistics cost was up 33 per cent at ₹1,127 a tonne, while raw material expenses were down 14 per cent at ₹476 a tonne.
The quarter witnessed increase in variable costs attributable to rise in pet coke and coal prices. The ban on pet coke usage in some States also adversely impacted performance.
Despite this, the company registered 18 per cent profit before interest, depreciation and tax during the quarter.
UltraTech Cement has managed to increased the capacity utilisation at the recently acquired JP Cement plants to 60 per cent from 18 per cent at the time of acquisition.
The company has completed launching UltraTech brand in new markets.
Substantial improvements have been carried out at these plants in terms of their operating parameters and appointment of new dealers to establish UltraTech brand in new markets.
The acquisition is generating incremental earnings as planned which are improving month-on-month, it said.
On a standalone basis net profit was down 25 per cent at ₹421 crore (₹563 crore), while net sales increased 34 per cent at ₹7,471 crore (₹5,540 crore).
The company expects higher budget allocation for infrastructure and rural development will be key to drive demand."
64,2018-02-16,UltraTech,"UltraTech Cement sees no CCI hurdle in Binani Cement deal
UltraTech Cement, which has placed a bid of ₹7,000 crore for the stressed Binani Cement asset, is not expecting any hurdle in getting the Competition Commission of India’s approval for the deal.
Atul Daga, Chief Financial Officer, UltraTech Cement, said even after the acquisition, UltraTech will have only 14 million tonne per annum (mtpa) capacity in Rajasthan, while Shree Cement will reach 19 mtpa with its ongoing capacity addition of 2 mt.
“We may have a problem in getting the CCI approval, if we acquire a stressed asset in north Karnataka were we are very strong, but in Rajasthan, we still have room even after Binani acquisition,” he added.
According to Binani Cement's website, it has a global manufacturing capacity of 11.25 mtpa with a domestic capacity of 6.25 mtpa and an integrated plant in China and grinding units in Dubai. 
UltraTech Cement has agreed to pay ₹6,000 crore upfront and the rest in equity. 
Internal study
This means that the banks will get over and above ₹6,000 crore they are trying to recover from the sale of stressed Binani Cement asset. Ashok Gupta, Director (Legal Services), Aditya Birla Management Corporation, said the Group has done enough analysis and internal study on the market before placing the bid for Binani Cement and there should not be any problem in getting the Competition Commission’s approval if UltraTech Cement emerges as the top bidder.
There are about 15 cement companies in the (northern) region where Binani Cement plant is located and even after the acquisition UltraTech Cement market share will be closer to 20 per cent, while the CCI is comfortable with one company having market share of 25 to 40 per cent, he added.
On the issue of price cartelisation by the government on the cement industry, Gupta said this allegation is there since the sector was liberalised in 1969 and earlier cases were filed almost every month.
Given the huge competition among 60-70 companies and different cost structure for each companies, it is impossible for cement manufacturers to indulge in cartelisation.
Cement prices are rising because of various factors including the increase in cost of land and mines acquisition, transportation expenses have gone up in the last few years, he said.
Asked on the strategy of cement companies to lower production to keep prices high, Gupta said companies cannot keep on producing cement just because they have the capacity as they have to recover fixed cost and operation expenses to stay profitable."
63,2018-03-08,UltraTech,"UltraTech loosens purse strings, offers ₹700 cr more for Binani
 
UltraTech Cement, an Aditya Birla Group company, has agreed to increase its bid for Binani Cement’s stressed assets by ₹700 crore to a total of ₹7,250 crore. It has also agreed to pay the entire money up front to outbid Bharat Dalmia.
Last Monday, a consortium led by Bharat Dalmia had been declared the highest bidder by a resolution professional (RP) overseeing the sale of the stressed assets. The RP had also invited Bharat Dalmia to discuss a resolution plan.
Following this, UltraTech had moved the National Company Law Tribunal seeking a reassessment of the bids for Binani Cement, and had asked the RP to share the evaluation criteria.
On Thursday, Atul Daga, Chief Financial Officer, UltraTech Cement, told BusinessLine that the company had decided to raise its bid rather than moving the NCLT and delaying the process.
When asked if the lenders would accept the new bid, Daga said: “We have submitted our revised bid. It is for the lenders to decide what best suits them. They will accept it if they want to extract the maximum value for the stressed asset.”
Earlier, the resolution professional had said the winning bidder would be decided based on a scoring methodology. But there was no clarity on this, he said.
Binani Cement owes about ₹4,000 crore to lenders and ₹2,000 crore to operational creditors. The company has a production capacity of 11 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and had received bids from Ramco Cement, Heidelberg, stockbroker Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and JSW Cement, besides Dalmia-Bain and UltraTech.
Twists and turns
JSW Cement was announced as the winner in the first round, but the resolution professional had decided to call for rebidding due to the detection of a fresh liability.
Bharat Dalmia, along with Bain Capital’s India Resurgent Fund and Piramal Enterprises, had bid ₹6,700 crore, offering ₹6,300 crore to the lenders and another ₹400 crore as capital infusion.
Interestingly, the Competition Commission of India has already approved the proposed acquisition of Binani Cement by Rajputana Properties, a subsidiary of Dalmia Bharat Cement.
This was the first transaction to be notified to the CCI involving the acquisition of a corporate debtor under the insolvency code."
62,2018-03-11,UltraTech,"Bharat Dalmia awaits NCLT verdict even as UltraTech raises bid for Binani Cement 
The consortium led by Bharat Dalmia Cement is confident of taking over the stressed assets of Binani Cement despite the rival Aditya Birla Group-owned UltraTech Cement raising its bid by ₹700 crore to ₹7,200 crore after the lenders announced the former as the highest winning bidder.
Interestingly, a day before revising its bid, UltraTech had moved the National Company Law Tribunal stating lack of transparency in the selection of the highest bidder for Binani asset.
“Lenders have issued a letter declaring Bharat Dalmia Cement consortium as the highest bidder and rejected UltraTech bid. Now whatever price UltraTech is willing to pay is immaterial and does not have any value,” said a source tracking the developments.
If Bharat Dalmia Cement’s bid is endorsed by NCLT, it will be its third acquisition of a bankrupt company, after Murli Cement and Kalyanpur Cement. It is surprising that UltraTech is claiming that there was no transparency in bidding as the score sheet based on eligibility was displayed on the Web site in advance and some of the bidders had even raised questions on it, said an executive of a cement company which was part of the auction which was conducted under the watchful eyes of the Central Vigilance Commission.
The outcome of the Binani Cement case will be watched keenly not only by interested parties but also by global companies as the NPA-laden banking sector tries to attract foreign investors in future auctions. Lenders are in the process of monetising defaulting companies assets to recover over ₹3-lakh crore of bad debt through the NCLT-driven process.
Binani Cement was dragged to NCLT by Bank of Baroda after it defaulted on ₹410-crore loan.
Edelweiss ARC has the largest exposure with ₹2,673 crore followed by Bank of Baroda with ₹410 crore besides State Bank of India (₹323 crore) and Canara Bank (₹320 crore). Unsecured lenders include IDBI Bank (₹1,567 crore), Exim Bank (₹617 crore) and Bank of Baroda’s London branch (₹175 crore)."

It is surprising that UltraTech is claiming that there was no transparency in bidding as the score sheet based on eligibility was displayed on the Web site in advance and some of the bidders had even raised questions on it, said an executive of a cement company which was part of the auction which was conducted under the watchful eyes of the Central Vigilance Commission.
 The outcome of the Binani Cement case will be watched keenly not only by interested parties but also by global companies as the NPA-laden banking sector tries to attract foreign investors in future auctions. Lenders are in the process of monetising defaulting companies assets to recover over ₹3-lakh crore of bad debt through the NCLT-driven process.
Binani Cement was dragged to NCLT by Bank of Baroda after it defaulted on ₹410-crore loan.
Edelweiss ARC has the largest exposure with ₹2,673 crore followed by Bank of Baroda with ₹410 crore besides State Bank of India (₹323 crore) and Canara Bank (₹320 crore). Unsecured lenders include IDBI Bank (₹1,567 crore), Exim Bank (₹617 crore) and Bank of Baroda’s London branch (₹175 crore)."
60,2018-03-15,UltraTech,"UltraTech gears up for legal war over Binani Cement sale
UltraTech Cement, an Aditya Birla Group company, has expressed surprise over lenders announcing Dalmia Bharat-led consortium as the highest bidder for stressed Binani Cement asset without considering its revised bid of ₹7,266 crore.
Atul Daga, Chief Financial Officer, UltraTech Cement, said it seems that the lenders had already decided in favour of Dalmia Cement, even before the bidding process started and this decision will lead to litigations.
“We had already moved NCLT against the lenders’ decision and it will come up for hearing on March 19. We are hopeful that NCLT would rule in our favour, if not we will consider other options including moving the High Court,” he added.
NCLT should rule in UltraTech favour as it had earlier directed the lenders to consider Liberty House bid for Bhushan Steel even though it was placed after the deadline, he said.
On Wednesday, lenders, including large banks, voted in favour of accepting Dalmia Bharat bid of ₹6,700 crore turning down UltraTech’s revised offer of ₹7,266 crore.
The voting on the bids was done only by large banks and they are not considering the interest of 2,950 minority lenders who will be repaid in full if UltraTech offer is considered, said Daga.
Scoring methodology
In fact, the Hong Kong branch of State Bank of India, one of the minority lenders, has already approached NCLT against the voting decision. Raising questions over the scoring methodology, Daga said UltraTech superior over Dalmia on all counts with a topline of ₹25,000 crore and zero debt.
“Even before we revised the bid higher, the difference in score between us was just in decimals. We lost out as resolution professional advisor unilaterally decided that we will not get the Competition Commission of India approval for the deal even though we had proved it wrong,” said Daga.
Rajasthan market
UltraTech will not be a dominant player in Rajasthan market as it is crowded with presence of top six cement companies.
After Binani deal, UltraTech will have capacity of only 14 mtpa in Rajasthan, while Shree Cement will reach 19 mtpa with its ongoing capacity addition of 2 mtpa, he added.
On UltraTech expertise in turning around stressed asset, Daga said Jaiprakash Associates distress sale of 21 mtpa acquired by UltraTech for ₹16,100 crore has already become cash break-even in just nine months after the deal was completed."

 UltraTech Cement on Monday took a bold move to kill Dalmia Bharat’s bid to acquire Binani Cement. The Aditya Birla Group company has cut a deal with Binani Industries to acquire 98.43 per cent stake in the latter’s distressed assets for ₹7,266 crore. The move in effect bypasses the ongoing insolvency proceedings initiated by the lenders of Binani Cement.
UltraTech’s offer has been backed by Binani Industries, which has filed a petition seeking to withdraw the insolvency proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal’s Kolkata bench.
Letter of comfort
Binani Industries has also requested UltraTech for a letter of comfort confirming that the company will provide funds to pay off the financial creditors, effect settlement to trade creditors and for payment of costs incurred in the corporate insolvency resolution process.
The deal will test the Insolvency & Bankruptcy rules as it creates a complex situation. On the one hand, the bid placed by Dalmia Bharat has been given the green signal by the Resolution Professional (RP) appointed to sell Binani’s assets; on the other, Binani Industries has cut a separate deal with UltraTech, which could give more to the lenders. UltraTech had also put in its bid for Binani through the NCLT-led process but the RP picked Dalmia Bharat.
UltraTech said the deal with Binani is subject to termination of the current insolvency proceedings in which the consortium led by Dalmia Bharat was declared as the highest bidder to acquire the asset by the committee of creditors.
KK Maheshwari, Managing Director, UltraTech Cement, said the company has lost confidence in the NCLT proceedings and is still keen to know why its highest bid was rejected by the Committee of Creditors.
But the key question is whether a company can cut its own deal after insolvency proceedings have been initiated. Ashok Gupta, Legal Head, UltraTech Cement, said the right of property is guaranteed under the Indian constitution. The Transfer of Property Act and Sarfesi Act have provisions that Binani Industries can protect its property even at this stage.
Babu Sivaprakasam, Partner, Economic Laws Practice, said this may go all the way to the Supreme Court as rejecting the higher bid may lead to an aggrieved unsecured lender challenging that his interest has not been protected despite a higher offer was available.
“Such decisions will lay down the rules for the Committee of Creditors to take care of the interest of unsecured lenders and stakeholders even when their interests are fully protected,” he added.
 Dalmia Bharat did not comment on UltraTech’s move, but it could be betting on the lenders sticking with the NCLT process instead of letting private deals scuttle the proceedings."
59,2018-03-19,UltraTech,"UltraTech to buy Binani Cement, seeks end to insolvency proceedings 
 UltraTech Cement today said it has entered into an agreement with Binani Industries to buy 98 per cent stake in its debt ridden subsidiary Binani Cement Ltd (BCL) which is going through insolvency proceedings. In a filing to the stock exchange, UltraTech said it will issue a comfort letter to provide Rs 7,266 crore to Binani Industries Ltd for ending insolvency proceedings against Binani Cement.
“The company has in principle concluded commercial understanding with Binani Industries Ltd (BIL) for purchase of 98.47 per cent of the shareholding of BCL subject to termination of IBC proceedings,” UltraTech Cement said in a stock exchange filing. It added that the company’s board has agreed to issue the comfort letter confirming that the company will provide funds to BIL amounting to Rs 7,266 crore, as offered to the Committee of Creditors (COC) in terms of the resolution plan submitted by it for acquiring BCL.
Binani Industries had approached UltraTech Cement for arranging funds to pay-off the lenders, debt and other liabilities, as admitted in the IBC proceedings against an offer for sale of its entire shareholding in Binani Cement. It has requested UltraTech Cement to issue a comfort letter, which will be used as a support in its application seeking termination of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings."
56,2018-03-25,UltraTech,"Binani Cement’s MSME creditors form forum to fight for rights
As many as 70 operational creditors of Binani Cement have formed a forum to oppose Aditya Birla Group company UltraTech Cement’s ₹150-crore offer, stating that the claim amount is at least four times higher than the amount offered. The operational creditors — a clutch of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) — peg the claim amount at ₹700 crore.
The new forum — Binani Operational Creditors’ Forum (BOCF) — intends to take up the issue with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) when it meets on Tuesday in Kolkata. The operational creditors, a clutch of MSMEs, had supplied coal and packaging bags and provided transportation and sales support to Binani Cement.
Binani Cement has more than 3,000 operational creditors, and these 70 entities claim that the company owes nearly 80 per cent of the total dues to them. BOCF is also in talks with others to bring them into the fold.
A fight for dues
“The forum’s basic idea is that we will go to every extent to ensure the maximisation of the operational creditors’ value and we get our due. We have to fight for our rights, otherwise one NCLT filing will have a cascading effect on the MSME sector itself,” said Hitesh Bindal, a spokesperson for the forum.
“Being a supplier, if I don’t get my money, I might not be able to pay my suppliers and lenders. This is a larger industry issue as it will result in multiple NCLT filings,” added Bindal, who is a supplier of coal to Binani Cement. The forum has “no intention” of delaying Binani Cement’s debt-resolution proceedings, he said, adding: “We are only seeking our due.”
Earlier, UltraTech Cement pegged the operational creditors’ claim at ₹503 crore, and proposed to pay ₹149.7 crore to them, a 30 per cent payout. This was part of an earlier deal UltraTech had with Binani Industries to acquire a 98.43 per cent stake in the latter’s distressed assets for ₹7,266 crore.
Last week, eight MSMEs had filed an intervention petition against Binani Cement’s Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP) and its Committee of Creditors (CoC). The petitioners had sought “to secure or ensure that the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process balances the interest of all operational creditors.”"
55,2018-03-26,UltraTech,"Make cities accountable
This is with reference to ‘Build a database of municipal bonds’ by K Subalakshmi (March 26). In mid-2017, the Pune Municipal Corporation raised ₹200 crore via a bond issue, slated to cover in time ₹2,464 crore which many saw as a test case for the revival of municipal bonds. That it was subscribed six times was good news.
This may also be seen against the loss of ₹156 crore in 2015-16 by the PMC; should the bond end up only balancing revenue deficit, it is flawed. Bonds are subject to investment ratings by independent agencies and coupon rates go up as ratings dip. The resultant rise in debt burden would make its servicing tough. Most cities consume more than half their revenue as salaries. If they have a pension scheme, the liabilities become open-ended.

Panagariya’s peeve
It is absurd to suggest that private banks (PVBs) have performed better than PSBs in priority sector lending. According to the RBI, the total priority sector advance as of March 31, 2017, of PSBs was ₹19,889 billion as against that of PVBs at ₹7,110 billion. Moreover, PVBs did not achieve targets under heads such as agriculture and weaker sections. Why does Panagariya recommend privatisation of PSBs?

The formation and sustenance initiatives of Farmer Producer Organisation have been hit by new financial policies; many of them have become defunct due to non-repayment of loans, discrimination against beneficiaries, embezzlement and politicisation.
These maladies have been remedied in this application and its capacity for serving both seasonal and perennial activities will make up for the absence of an integrated system.

Ultra Tech responds
The editorial,‘Bankruptcy matters’ (March 23) has raised some questions on the IBC process with respect to Binani Cement Ltd. We would like to point out that we are one of the highest bidders; we ought to be H-1.
The CoC members were fully aware of our revised bid of ₹7,200 + crore, even at the time they decided to choose Dalmia Bharat Cement as the highest bidder.
On the issue of promoters, the law is clear, which is that the promoters, in this case, the listed company, Binani Industries Ltd, would continue to own its subsidiary, unless it sells or is forced to sell its subsidiary by an expression of law. IBC only allows creditors to secure their money through IBC process. It does not change the ownership of the assets of the company unless there is a formal court order in this regard.
Contrary to what the editorial says, Binani Industries made the offer to our company. Consequently, the board was duty-bound to consider it.
UltraTech’s Board insisted that Binani Industries should proactively apprise the NCLT about their offer. The Board also made it abundantly clear to Binani Industries that the agreement would go into force only after the IBC proceedings are terminated. It may also be noted that the price offered to Binani Industries Ltd. is same as what was already offered to COC.
While taking this decision, the Board consulted legal luminaries on whether the Binani offer was tenable by law. Legal experts have opined that redeeming one’s mortgaged property is a matter of constitutional right, until the property is sold. Till date Binani Industries continues to be the owner of Binani Cement Limited.

54,2018-03-28,UltraTech,"CCI approves UltraTech bid for Binani Cement


A view of Binani Cement India Plant




A view of Binani Cement India Plant


UltraTech Cement has received Competition Commission of India approval to acquire Binani Cement.
The company was declared the second-highest bidder, behind Dalmia Bharat Cement, in the bidding for the stressed asset.
The Aditya Birla Group company claimed that a lot of apprehensions had been raised by the resolution professional on it being able to obtain CCI clearance on its bid for Binani Cement, whereas the regulator had cleared the deal on Wednesday.
“UltraTech was rated the H2 (second highest) bidder instead of H1 (highest bidder), for this reason. The CCI clearance validates UltraTech’s contention that they were wrongly and unjustifiably rated H2 instead of H1,” said UltraTech in a statement.
Dalmia cries foul
Mahendra Singhi, Group CEO and Whole Time Director, Dalmia Cement (Bharat), told BusinessLine that the bankers have already taken a ₹600 crore bank guarantee from the company and it would amount to a breach of contract and trust if they changed their decision now.
The bankers cannot strike a deal with the Binani Cement promoters outside the NCLT process as it would breach Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which bars defaulting promoters angling for their assets, he added.
“We expect the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to approve our bid as the highest and give its stamp at the next hearing,” said Singhi. Stating that the reasons cited by the unsuccessful bidder for its failed bid are misleading, Singhi said Dalmia Bharat had made the highest financial bid and obtained the highest score in the evaluation.
The CCI approval was contemplated to be a post-NCLT verdict. The only issue was whether any adverse CCI order, imposing penalties, had been passed against any bidder over the last five years. Such penalties had been imposed on Ultratech (and other companies) for alleged cartelisation, in 2016 and 2017.
KK Maheshwari, MD, UltraTech Cement, in an earlier interview with BusinessLine, said that the CCI penalty has been challenged in the Competition Appellate Tribunal and it should in no way concern the resolution professional as the company has since executed three deals and received CCI approvals for the same."

The out-of-court deal between UltraTech and Binani Industries seems headed towards fruition, with the latter offering to pay its lenders the entire debt of ₹7,200 crore if they withdraw the insolvency proceedings against it.
Binani will meet its creditors on Wednesday with the proposal. If it is accepted, UltraTech will inch closer to acquiring Binani Cement under an agreement announced recently.
The development comes even as the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Tuesday directed the creditors and the company to consider an amicable settlement on the issue. “We give liberty to parties to reach (a) settlement and approach (the) appropriate forum for final approval of the settlement,” said NCLAT, while hearing a petition filed by Binani Industries, the promoter of Binani Cement.
Sameer Kaji, Legal Advisor, Binani Cement, said it was now clear that the company’s offer to repay the entire debt is valid and has to be considered in the interest of all creditors. “We will make a submission to creditors on Wednesday and hopefully it will be accepted,” he added.
On Monday, the NCLAT had set a deadline of April 9 for the Committee of Creditors (CoC) to hear Binani’s application for an out-of-court settlement. However, the CoC has already declared Dalmia Bharat Cement the highest bidder for Binani Cement and also accepted a bank guarantee equivalent to 10 per cent of the bid amount. Both Dalmia Bharat and UltraTech had bid for Binani Cement under the insolvency process, but the former was declared winner.
Mahindra Singhi, Group CEO, Dalmia Cement Bharat, said the NCLAT was clear that an amicable solution should be arrived at among all parties, which also includes Dalmia Cement. “I am sure the creditors’ committee will consider the legal provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) before arriving at a final decision on striking an out-of-court settlement,” he added.
Earlier, the creditors had rejected Aditya Birla Group company UltraTech Cement’s bid for Binani even after the company raised its offer by ₹700 crore to ₹7,266 crore. Circumventing the NCLT proceeding, UltraTech signed an out-of-court deal with Binani Cement to buy out 98.43 per cent for the sum if insolvency proceedings were withdrawn.
IBC under stress
The case will test the new insolvency rules because it places the lenders in a dilemma. While it will be beneficial for creditors to accept UltraTech Cement’s higher offer, it will raise doubts on the entire insolvency resolution process if counter-bids are allowed through bilateral agreements."
52,2018-04-05,UltraTech,"Binani Cement loan default case: NCLAT wants resolution under only IBC provisions
The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has directed the Kolkata Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to consider the Binani Cement case only under the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
The NCLAT passed the order in New Delhi on Thursday based on a petition filed by Dalmia Bharat Cement.
Mahindra Singhi, Group CEO, Dalmia Bharat Cement, said the company had filed the petition on Wednesday and the present order seals any attempt by Binani Cement to reach an out-of-court settlement with UltraTech Cement. When pointed to the NCLAT order on April 3, which had suggested that creditors consider Binani’s out-of-court plea, Singhi said Dalmia could not make its representation adequately on April 3 as it was not aware that Binani — which had moved the appellate body for some other case — would raise the out-of-court settlement issue.
“The Appellate Tribunal ruling on Thursday has directed NCLT not to get influenced by either its April 3 order or NCLT’s own order on March 23 that directed creditors to consider an out-of-court settlement,” he added.
Quantum of interest
However, Binani Cement is confident of executing the out-of-court deal with UltraTech. It plans to file a revised offer with creditors late on Thursday night, said sources close to the company.
In the Wednesday meeting, some of the creditors had raised the quantum of interest to be charged on Binani’s defaulted loan.
The insolvency case against Binani Cement was filed on July 26, 2017, and the calculation of interest on loan stopped then. Now, if the out-of-court deal is to be accepted, the creditors want to charge interest on the loan since July 26.
As per Binani’s math, the interest would work out to ₹250 crore for the entire 270 days valid period of NCLT proceedings. However, the creditors did not have this figure on Wednesday, and told the company to prepare it. This will be submitted on Thursday night in the tweaked offer, said the sources. Binani hopes to close the deal with creditors for ₹7,500 crore in three days, the sources added."
51,2018-04-11,UltraTech,"To cover up fraud in cement unit, Binani acting for UltraTech, alleges Dalmia in letter to RBI


The Rajputana letter alleges that the BIL proposal of an out-of-court settlement is an attempt to hide culpability for the loss of ₹2,400 crore caused by the fraudulent trades by Binani Industries promoter Braj Binani in Binani Cement.




The Rajputana letter alleges that the BIL proposal of an out-of-court settlement is an attempt to hide culpability for the loss of ₹2,400 crore caused by the fraudulent trades by Binani Industries promoter Braj Binani in Binani Cement.


In what appears to be a move to set off a rethink among Binani Cement’s creditors on UltraTech’s bid, Dalmia Bharat Group arm Rajputana Properties — the highest bidder for Binani Cement — has claimed that by proposing an out-of-court settlement, promoter Braj Binani is trying to front for the losing bidder and aiming to suppress serious charges of fraud against the company.
In separate letters written to the RBI and the Committee of Creditors of Binani Cement Ltd (BCL) but not marked to Binani Cement, Rajputana Properties alleged that Braj Binani’s real motive is to front for UltraTech at the fag end of a nearly nine-month-long IBC process, and escape the consequences of serious fraud charges of ₹2,400 crore in BCL.
While UltraTech refused to comment as it has not seen the letter, a Binani Cement spokesperson told BusinessLine the company is looking forward to a hearing in the Supreme Court on April 13 to pay off the lenders and release the pledge.
ALSO READ: ‘Lack of transparency in Binani Cement bidding process’
NCLT notice
The letter alleged that Binani Industries Ltd (BIL), which owns BCL, is itself insolvent and owes over ₹1,700 crore to creditors for several years. NCLT Kolkata has issued notice to the company on a winding-up petition, said the letter, urging creditors to confirm the deal with Dalmia Group in three days. “BIL lenders have called in the guarantees. His (Braj Binani’s) intent to sell BCL stake to UltraTech (the losing bidder) is a clever ploy to offer UltraTech a back-door entry and dislodge the highest bidder, Rajputana Properties,” the letter alleged.
The letter to the RBI comes even as the Supreme Court is to take up for hearing on Friday a BIL petition seeking approval for an out-of-court settlement with creditors.
Mahindra Singhi, Group CEO, Dalmia Bharat Cement, told BusinessLine that the company will present the facts in the apex court. The Rajputana letter alleged that the BIL proposal of an out-of-court settlement is an attempt to hide culpability for the loss of ₹2,400 crore caused by the fraudulent trades by BIL promoter Braj Binani in BCL.
In the light of daily frauds in the banking sector, any settlement with BIL will be scandalous, illegal, contrary to law and make the bank a co-conspirator to yet another fraud and become a reputation issue for lenders, said the letter, seeking their support for Dalmia Bharat’s bid.
It may be noted that the NCLT has given banks the liberty to consider an out-of-court settlement, but did not direct the banks to violate laws, act contrary to Central Vigilance Commission or Indian Banks’ Association guidelines, the letter stated."

KK MAHESHWARI Managing Director, UltraTech Cement




KK MAHESHWARI Managing Director, UltraTech Cement


 
UltraTech Cement, the country’s largest cement company, is in a pitched battle against Dalmia Bharat Cement to acquire the 10-million-tonne of stressed Binani Cement asset. UltraTech surprised the market first by increasing its bid by ₹700 crore to ₹7,266 crore at the eleventh hour and followed it up by signing a deal with Binani Cement to buyout the asset out-of-court. KK Maheshwari, Managing Director, UltraTech Cement, spoke to BusinessLine on the developments and way ahead. Excerpts:
Why did you raise the bid so late?
When the bidding process started we were told that we would be called for negotiations if we were selected. So we kept the best for last. We would have anyway increased the bid if they had called for negotiations as promised earlier. It is strange that creditors are rejecting a bid which is offering maximum value. We followed the principal of fair and equitable treatment, while bidding and gave equal weightage to all unsecured creditors rather than favouring large secured creditors who have the voting rights. We did not focus on catering the vote bank. We offered to pay entire dues to 98 per cent of small trade creditors as they suffer the most.
Is there a precedence of this sort?
This whole IBC is a new thing. However, there is precedence under the other law. Suppose someone mortgage their property and it comes to auction due to default, the owner of the property has the right to accept a higher bid out of the auction process, but before the auction deal is ratified by the Court. The entire process is one of the mechanisms to recover maximum money. There is already a Sarfaesi Act (Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act) then why will they come out with IBC. Whatever mechanism you follow, the Court has to look at the interest of every creditor and not only that of banks.
Why deal with Binani directly? Have you lost faith in NCLT?
Absolutely not. We have full faith in NCLT that is exactly why we filed our revised offer with NCLT after our bid was rejected. Despite our revised higher bid, the resolution professional has decided to go with Dalmias. That’s when Binani approached us asking whether we can do a bilateral deal with them on the same terms and conditions like that of NCLT. We said if they can take the company out of NCLT we can do it. Obviously they will be affected because it is their asset which is on the block.
What if NCLT orders a rebidding?
Let us see. I cannot prejudge what NCLT will do. The entire Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was formed to extract maximum value for the stressed asset. Whether the maximum value is derived through the court process or outside it should not matter unless the debt is paid off fully. The Court can also reject the entire process if Binani wants to withdraw from NCLT and pay off the entire debt.
Is it proper to hike the bid after knowing the other bidders’ amount?
There is no transparency in this bidding process. The financial and technical bid will work only if the process is pre-defined. They should have defined how different creditors will be treated and given their outstanding amount. The scoring process needs to be defined properly. The RP reduced our marks just because there was a CCI litigation. They have also not considered the fact that we have received CCI approval for three takeovers even after the ongoing litigation. This beats logic. Reducing our marks on CCI issue was unwarranted. We have written half-a-dozen letter and they have not responded even once.
Do you think this case will reach the Supreme Court?
I really do not know. It is a clear open-and-shut case. They have two offers in front and select the highest bidder. If people do not get fair treatment, the Apex court is the last resort. It is a Binani Cement asset and bankers had taken it to NCLT to recover money. Now the company is saying take the money and give the asset back. It is as simple as that.
Will consolidation in the industry lead to monopoly?
The cement industry is highly capital-intensive and has long gestation period. There can be some mismatch in demand and supply for various reasons. In the last four decades of our existence, we expanded capacity irrespective of mismatch in demand-supply. Even if we get Binani, there are other large players in Rajasthan like Shree Cement, LafargeHolcim, Wonder Cement, JK Lakshmi Cement and JK Cement. All these companies have taken new mining licence for expansion. With this intense competition, it is difficult to even command 18-25 per cent market share as there are six large companies breathing down the neck. It is a fragmented industry and nobody can even think of monopolistic power."

Another cement grinding facility of 1.75 mtpa and a waste heat recovery system of 13-MW capacity are expected to be commissioned by September 2018, the company said in a statement on Thursday. 
The plant has been commissioned not only at a record time of less than one year, but also at a cost of less than $90 a tonne, it added. 
Atul Daga, Whole-time Director and Chief Financial Officer, told BusinessLine that a greenfield plant of this capacity globally would cost about $110 a tonne and the reduction in cost achieved by the company reflects its ability to execute projects to perfection. The capacity at the plant can easily be doubled to 7.5 mtpa given the limestone mining life of 30-40 years even though it has to rely on imports for petcoke, he added."

UltraTech Cement, an Aditya Birla group company, has reported marginal fall in December quarter net profit at ₹724 crore against ₹726 crore logged in the same period last year, largely due to one-time provisioning of ₹226 crore for the stamp duty expenses incurred for buying out JP Associates’ cement asset.
Sales in the quarter under review were up 34 per cent at ₹9,298 crore against ₹6,922 crore recorded last year.
Dividend payment
The company has announced a dividend of ₹10.50 a share leading to outflow of ₹288 crore. 
In addition, it will pay the Dividend Distribution Tax of ₹59.27 crore, resulting in a total payout of ₹348 crore.
Atul Daga, Director & Group CFO, told BusinessLine that the capacity utilisation at the erstwhile JP Associate cement plants has been ramped up to 75 per cent from 18 per cent with fresh investments and it will reach optimal capacity by end of this fiscal.
The overall capacity utilisation was at 80 per cent in the March quarter due to drag down impact of JP cement asset, he added.
The company has repaid debt of ₹1,000 corre in the March quarter to bring down the overall debt to ₹12,007 crore from ₹13,600 crore at the time of acquiring JP assets in June last year.
The company's consolidated net debt was at ₹14,062 corre against cash surplus of ₹215 crore logged in the last fiscal.
The debt to EBITDA has come down to 1.85 in March quarter from a high of 2.4 recorded in June quarter.
The company plans to reduce debt further in the coming months. Finance cost more than doubled to ₹344 crore (₹167 crore).
Sales volume was up 32 per cent at 17.64 million tonne (mt).

47,2018-05-04,UltraTech,"Appellate tribunal refuses to stay NCLT order allowing UltraTech to bid for Binani Cement
Our Bureau The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has declined to stay an order passed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) allowing the lenders of Binani Cement to consider the offer made by Aditya Birla Group’s UltraTech Cement. 
The NCLT decision had been challenged by Dalmia Bharat. The appellate tribunal will further hear the case on May 22. 
The NCLT on Wednesday had asked the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Binani Cement to consider the revised offer from UltraTech Cement Ltd. The tribunal, however, allowed Dalmia Bharat to match UltraTech’s revised offer, if it so chooses. 
The Dalmia Bharat-controlled Rajputana Properties Pvt Ltd (RPPL) was the highest bidder for Binani Cement. 
But UltraTech subsequently offered to increase its bid. The proposal was rejected by the CoC on the grounds that the higher bid was placed by Ultratech after the deadline had passed. 
However, the Kolkata Bench of the NCLT directed the CoC to reconsider the resolution plan by Ultratech. 
UltraTech’s first bid for Binani Cement under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was lower than Dalmia’s offer. The CoC therefore began negotiations with the H1 bidder, Dalmia’s RPPL.
However, UltraTech sought to revise its offer for Binani Cement, which was disallowed by the CoC. 
Thereafter, in a parallel deal, UltraTech signed an agreement with Binani Industries — the parent company of Binani Cement — to buy its cement assets for ₹7,266 crore. 
Over the past two months, UltraTech revised the bid and is now said to be offering nearly ₹8,000 crore for Binani Cement, which will cover all the financial and operational creditor dues."

The Committee of Creditors of Binani Cement has called for an urgent meeting of promoters, financial creditors, operational creditors on Thursday to consider the enhanced revised offer of ₹7,840 crore placed by the Aditya Birla Group company UltraTech Cement.
The meeting will also consider appointment of Umesh Lathi as Chief Financial Officer of Binani Cement and fix remuneration for his services rendered from January.
This will be the 16th meeting of the committee, who are trying to sell Binani Cement’s asset to recover their dues.
Video conferencing
Given the short notice for the meeting, the resolution professional has arranged for video conferencing and other audio and visual means for participants, said sources.
If any participant attending the meeting through video conferencing, they have to mention the location from where they wish to attend with the relevant IP address, at least 12 hours before the meeting, he said.
Those attending the meeting through video conferencing or other means will also be considered as part of quorum for the meeting, he added.
The CoC meeting comes after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) direction to consider UltraTech Cement even though it was submitted after Dalmia Bharat was declared the highest bidder for the stressed Binani Cement asset.
Meanwhile, Dalmia Bharat has filed a petition in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal seeking a stay on NCLT order to consider UltraTech bid. 
While admitting the petition for hearing, NCLAT rejected the plea for an interim stay. The petition is coming up for hearing on May 22.
Though the stressed Binani Cement asset had attracted interest from over 20 companies, the final contest had boiled down to UltraTech Cement and Dalmia Bharat.
 UltraTech first offer was tad lower at ₹6,500 crore compared to Dalmia Bharat’s ₹6,700 crore.
 However, UltraTech revised to higher to ₹7,300 crore and finally to ₹7,840 crore."

Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
I hold shares of UltraTech Cement bought at ₹4,218 per share and UCO Bank at ₹39. What will be their outlook for the next 12 months?
J Parimelazhagan
UltraTech Cement (₹4,063.1): The stock of UltraTech Cement is in a long-term uptrend. However, it encountered a key resistance in the ₹4,500-4,550 band in May 2017. Since then, the stock has been in an intermediate-term sideways consolidation phase in the broad range between ₹3,800 and ₹4,500. Whenever the stock reaches the lower boundary, it takes support in the ₹3800-3,850 range and reverses higher; it took support in early April this year and moved up. As long as the stock trades above this significant support range, it has the potential to resume its long-term uptrend.
You can consider averaging the stock with a stop-loss at ₹3,750. A strong breach of the immediate resistance at ₹4,200 can take it up to ₹4,400 and then to ₹4,550 in the medium term.
An emphatic upward breakthrough of ₹4,550 is required to strengthen the long-term uptrend and push the stock higher to ₹4,700 levels in the long run.
But you can consider taking partial profits if the stock faces difficulty in surpassing the ₹4,550 levels. Conversely, if the stock plunges below the vital long-term support level of ₹3,800, it can decline to ₹3,600 or even to ₹3,400 levels. In that case, exit the stock and re-enter at lower levels.
UCO Bank (₹19.1): The stock is in a downtrend across all-time frames. In February, it conclusively breached a long-term key support at ₹29 and continued to decline without any corrective up-move. It is currently at a multi-year low. However, it is likely to take support at current levels. The indicators feature in the oversold territory, implying that a corrective up-move is possible. This can take the stock higher to ₹23 and ₹27.
To alter the short-term downtrend, the stock needs to break above ₹29. In that case, it can extend the up-move to ₹33 and ₹36. If it continues the downtrend, it can find support at ₹14.3. Breach of this level can drag the stock down to ₹10 in the long run. If you are a high-risk investor, average at current levels and exit in rallies with a stop-loss at ₹18.
Please let me know the short, medium, and long-term targets of SQS India BFSI.
Balakrishnan MR
SQS India BFSI (₹577.8): The stock of SQS India BFSI has been on a long-term downtrend since encountering a key resistance at ₹1,290 in January 2016. Nevertheless, it found support at around ₹400 in August 2017 and began moving sideways with an upward bias.
Last week, the stock jumped 12 per cent, accompanied with above-average volume, and breached a key long-term resistance at ₹550.
But it faces crucial resistance now at ₹600. With the bullish momentum, the stock has the potential to break above ₹600 and reach the short-term target of ₹650 levels.
Medium-term targets are at ₹700 and ₹750 levels. In the long term, the stock can trend upwards to ₹850 levels. Investors with a long-term perspective can stay invested with a stop-loss at ₹440 levels. Short-term supports are at the levels of ₹550, ₹500 and ₹450.

 Aditya Birla Group firm UltraTech said it would acquire the cement business of BK Birla Group company Century Textiles and Industries through a share swap deal, a move which would further consolidate its position as market leader in the segment.
 The Board of Directors of UltraTech Cement, at its meeting held today, approved a scheme of arrangement amongst Century Textiles and Industries and its respective shareholders and creditors, the Aditya Birla Group firm said in a statement.
 According to the scheme, the shareholders of Century would get one equity share of UltraTech, having a face Rs 10/- each for every eight equity shares of Century of face value Rs 10 each.
 “UltraTech will issue 1.4 crore new equity shares to the shareholders of Century, which will increase its equity capital to Rs 288.58 crore, divided into 28.86 crore equity shares of Rs. 10/- each,” said UltraTech.
 “The acquisition will contribute positively to the company’s earnings,” it said further.
 The transaction would provide UltraTech, opportunity to further strengthen its presence in the east and central markets and extending its footprint in the Western and Southern markets in the country.
“The operations will be bolstered by economies of scale arising out of synergies in procurement and logistics costs; creation of efficiencies by reducing time to market, enhancing competitiveness as well as customer service,” said UltraTech 
It further said that the transaction is expected to be “consummated within 6-9 months“.
 “The transaction is subject to the approval of shareholders and creditors, stock exchanges, NCLT, CCI and all other regulatory approvals as may be required,” the company said. 
Century Textiles has three integrated cement units situated in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra with a total capacity of 11.4 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) and a grinding unit in West Bengal of 2.0 mtpa."

BL02_bmtet_birl+G3T2DACFB.3.jpg.jpg




BL02_bmtet_birl+G3T2DACFB.3.jpg.jpg


Century Textiles and Industries’ decision to divest its cement asset to UltraTech Cement will not only unlock value for shareholders, but also provide the company an opportunity to deleverage its balance sheet.
Currently, BK Birla-owned Century Textiles has exposure to the cement, textiles, pulp and paper and real estate businesses.
The company requires significant capital to modernise and grow these businesses. But the current leverage and cash flow does not provide flexibility to raise growth capital.
The divestment of the cement division with associate liabilities, including debt of ₹3,000 crore, will bring down net debt and EBITDA to 1.6 times from 3.1 times. 
High capex
On the reason for spinning off the cement asset, Century Textiles said some of the cement plants are old and require significant capital expenditure to modernise and enhance product quality.Besides, it will require high-maintenance capex for its upkeep. The cement plants were operating at 74 per cent capacity utilisation, it said.
The existing mines at the Raipur plant had limited limestone reserves. Therefore, additional mines have been acquired in auction. It requires an investment of ₹150 crore to acquire land for developing the mine and this will be invested by UltraTech, it said. 
Realty growth
Birla Estates is poised to capitalise on land parcels in Mumbai, Kalyan and near Pune and unlock value for shareholders, it added.
The company has 30 acres in Worli, 132 acres in Kalyan and 45 acres in Pune.
The company plans to roll out premium and mid-income housing and commercial projects in the surplus land. 
In addition, Birla Estates has signed an MoU to develop 1 million sq ft of residential project in Gurgaon. It plans similar MoUs to develop a residential, commercial and retail portfolio to achieve this plan and requires significant funding over the next five years, said the company. 
The pulp and paper business has its locational advantage and has performed well in the past three years. 
The company plans to modernise the facility and expand the tissue capacity and optimise the product mix to enhance profitability, it said. 
Century Textile will continue to have exposure to the cement business through its highly liquid equity shareholding in UltraTech, the company said."

 Shares in UltraTech Cement Ltd rose as much as 4.2 per cent to Rs 4,019. It posted its biggest intra-day percentage gain since April 19.
Century Textiles and Industries on Sunday approved the demerger of its cement business into UltraTech in an all-stock deal. Shareholders of Century Textiles will get one share of UltraTech for every eight shares held; UltraTech will absorb debt of around Rs 3,000 crore. Analysts at Macquarie say UltraTech's capacity would increase by 14 per cent to 110 million tonnes with this acquisition and extend its leadership in West, Central and East.
Macquarie has maintained “outperform” rating. While trailing earnings suggest 4-5 per cent EPS dilution for UltraTech, an increase in efficiency and brand premium should make the deal EPS accretive, according to Macquarie.
Acquired assets are close to existing assets of UltraTech and so do not offer a new market to UltraTech, Credit Suisse analysts write, keeping “underperform” rating.
However, synergies exist from higher pricing of UltraTech brand, procurement benefit from higher economies of scale and logistical advantages by redistributing Century output, Credit Suisse said.
Shares in Century Textiles plunged as much as 8.6 per cent to Rs 975.05, their lowest since March 15, 2017."
41,2018-05-22,UltraTech,"UltraTech acquisition of Century’s cement unit gets analysts’ thumbs up
 Our Bureau Most analysts welcome UltraTech Cement’s decision to acquire the cement business of BK Birla Group company Century Textiles and Industries through a share swap deal. Century Textile & Industries is to demerge its cement business and merge it with UltraTech. 
Post acquisition, UltraTech Cement will become the third-largest cement firm globally (excluding China) in terms of capacity.
In the near term, the deal will depress UltraTech’s margin, as its EBITDA per tonne is ₹970 in FY18 versus Century Textiles’ ₹445 (blended, including clinker volume). As Century Textiles’ cement book value is low, depreciation burden is likely to be less. Thus, the deal would be EPS-accretive, said Elara Capital, which upgraded its rating to “buy” on the stock with a new price target of ₹4,988.
The board of the Aditya Birla Group firm last week approved a scheme of arrangement whereby the shareholders of Century would get one equity share of UltraTech of face value ₹10 each for every eight equity shares with face value ₹10 each.
Besides, UltraTech will issue 1.4 crore new equity shares to the shareholders of Century, which will increase its equity capital to ₹288.58 crore.
Profit-, earnings-accretive
“We view this deal to be positive for Ultratech Cement as the assets are already operational and are going to be profit-accretive right from merger and are likely to be earnings-accretive within one year of merger,” said Teena Virmani of Kotak Securities.
According to Motilal Oswal, “By this acquisition, UltraTech has ensured higher market share with zero lead time for asset creation and at valuation largely in line with greenfield expansions, which we believe is positive.” Motilal expects a target price of ₹4,818 for UltraTech post the acquisition. 
Reliance Securities, with a price target of ₹5,100, expects the acquisition to be PAT-accretive (+8 per cent) and EPS-accretive (+3 per cent) in FY20E. “We believe, unlike the previous acquisition, UltraTech will not burn any cash in the initial years of operation, as the plants are already being operated above 74 per cent utilisation level,” it added.
However, Prabhudas Lilladher remains cautious on the deal. “UltraTech is confident to increase margins to ₹900/t (from the current ₹400) over a couple of years. However, we believe that margin improvement would restrict to ₹700 since current profitability already carries the benefits of restructuring done by UltraTech over the past couple of years on pricing and cost front,” it said, and added, “though UltraTech remains the best play in the sector, given its high scale and efficient operations, weak pricing power and expensive valuations limit us to maintain an ‘accumulate’ rating with a target price of ₹4,500.”"
40,2018-05-28,UltraTech,"Lenders green-light UltraTech’s bid for Binani Cement
UltraTech Cement has inched closer to acquiring Binani Cement, with the committee of creditors (CoC) voting to accept the Aditya Birla Group company’s ₹7,950-crore bid.
According to sources close to the lenders, UltraTech’s bid exceeded that of Dalmia Bharat by about ₹1,000 crore. Binani Cement owes ₹6,469 crore to its creditors.
The lenders will not have to take a haircut if UltraTech’s bid gets a final approval from the courts.
Under the insolvency rules, a resolution proposal needs the approval of 75 per cent of lenders. On Monday, UltraTech’s bid was approved by over 90 per cent of the lenders. It is not known which lenders opposed the proposal.
The matter will now be presented before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for approval. However, the Dalmia Bharat Cement-led consortium has already moved the Supreme Court challenging UltraTech’s eligibility. Dalmia had also moved the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). UltraTech has to clear these hurdles before it can claim Binani Cement.
Protracted proceedings
The case has seen many twists and turns over the last few months, testing the new insolvency laws. The resolution professional had initially picked the Dalmia Bharat consortium as the winning bidder.
UltraTech then raised its offer, but this offer was not considered as it was unclear if a bidder could revise an offer once all the bids had been opened.
Meanwhile, UltraTech and Binani complained against the decision to select Dalmia Bharat and mooted an out-of-court deal, outside the insolvency process. The matter was put to rest with the court asking the lenders to consider UltraTech’s revised offer.
Earlier, the CoC meeting scheduled on May 10 was called off after the resolution professional, Vijaykumar Iyer, said he wanted a legal opinion on Dalmia Bharat’s claim that UltraTech was ineligible to bid under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
Armed with the court ruling, the CoC of Binani Cement had given an ultimatum to Dalmia Bharat to better UltraTech’s offer or exit the bidding process. Dalmia Cement, however, has been insisting that its first bid is still valid, and is certain to seek legal relief."

Our Bureau UltraTech Cement, an Aditya Birla Group company, has reported a 30 per cent fall in June quarter net profit to ₹631 crore, against ₹898 crore in the previous year period, due to a sharp increase in costs and lower realisation.
Net sales were up 27 per cent at ₹8,841 crore (₹6,938 crore). Sales volume jumped 34 per cent 16.8 million tonnes (mt). 
Logistics costs, which accounted for 34 per cent of overall expenses, were up 9 per cent at ₹1,199 a tonne while diesel price increased 20 per cent, eating into the company’s profit margin. 
Energy cost was up 18 per cent at ₹1,028 a tonne as pet coke prices jumped 35 per cent. The depreciation of the rupee also pushed up the cost of imported pet coke.
Raw material costs
Raw material prices, which account for 14 per cent of overall costs, were up 8 per cent at ₹501 a tonne. Overall, expenses increased 21 per cent to ₹8,186 crore (₹6,767 crore).
Atul Daga, CFO, told BusinessLine the company is improving its overall operational efficiency to beat the cost push even as pet coke prices are expected to remain firm till October. “While we do not have control on crude prices, we have reduced the lead distance between the factory and the sale point by 6 per cent to trim logistics costs,” he said.
The recent government norm allowing trucks to carry 25 per cent more load than before will help bring down costs further, he added. 
The recently-acquired 21.2 mtpa cement plants of JP Associates have achieved average capacity utilisation of 70 per cent and cash break-even, Daga further said.

CCI has given its approval for the share swap deal, said Ultratech in a regulatory filing.
“...the Competition Commission of India has by its letter dated August 21 informed the company that it has approved the proposed combination under the Competition Act, 2012,” Ultratech said.
On May 20, UltraTech had proposed to acquire the cement business of BK Birla Group company Century Textiles, a move which would further consolidate its position as the market leader in the segment.

32,2018-10-14,UltraTech,"Birla MF holds swing vote in Century-UltraTech deal
 The Century Textile-UltraTech merger deal is going down to the wire, and Aditya Birla Mutual Fund’s vote on it may turn out to be the clincher. 
Proxy firm Institutional Investor Advisory Service (IiAS) has asked the largest non-promoter shareholder and other institutional investors to vote against the deal, citing loss to minority shareholders of Century Textiles. 
But legal and corporate governance experts fear that Aditya Birla Mutual Fund, which holds around 4.5 per cent stake in Century Textiles, may be able to swing the deal. The merger needs the support of 50 per cent of Century Textiles’ minority shareholders.
Market analysts reason that the merger is intended to bring all the cement assets of the Birla group under one roof. Once the merger is effected, Century Textiles will have a large real-estate business apart from pulp, paper and textiles. But the market reckons that cement companies are finiding better valuation than real-estate companies. About half of Century’s revenue comes from the cement business as of now, a report from IiAs said. 
“The per-tonne valuation of Century’s cement assets is lower than those considered in similar transactions,” IiAS said in its report to shareholders. “While it may be argued that the EV/EBITDA (enterprise value/earnings before interest, tax and debt amortisation) multiple is within the industry range, it is on the lower side. This would not be a concern, were this transaction not between two entities in the ‘same business group.’ After the sale, Century Textiles will be present in rayon, textiles paper and real estate.” 
In addition to Aditya Birla Mutual Fund’s 4.5 per cent stake, another 1.6 per cent stake in Century Textiles is held by Birla Corporation. Other large shareholders include LIC, Kotak Mutual Fund and Goldman Sachs. But each of them holds 1-2 per cent. Promoters led by Kumar Manglam Birla hold nearly 70 per cent stake in UltraTech and close to 51 per cent stake in Century. 
Both Century Textiles and UltraTech did not reply to email query from BusinessLine on the structure of the deal and concerns. 
“We recognise that the increasing competitiveness of the cement industry will require Century Textiles to build size to stay relevant. Therefore, an early exit of the business is a strategic decision – but it need not be a hurried one. For the group, it is far more efficient to house the cement business with UltraTech. However, given the significance of the cement business (it contributes 53 per cent to the company’s revenues and 40 per cent of company’s FY18 profits), and that this is a sale to a related party, the board should have made all the efforts possible to get the best value for its assets, even if it required inviting bids from other suitors,” IiAS report said.
Another proxy advisory firm, Shareholder Empowerment Services, has voted in favour of the deal. 
“At current value, the deal appears to favour Century shareholders marginally. But the long term additional volume to UltraTech will give them pricing power. Thus UltraTech will gain substantially,” said JN Gupta, promoter, SES."

UltraTech Cement has reported a 11 per cent drop in net profit in the September quarter at ₹376 crore against ₹424 crore logged in the same period last year, on the back of a sharp increase in operational cost.
Net sales were up 20 per cent at ₹8,111 crore (₹6,752 crore) over the previous year. Domestic sales volume jumped 21 per cent.
Rising energy and logistics cost coupled with rupee depreciation pushed up operational expenses by 14 per cent, pulling down profits despite higher sales volume, said the Aditya Birla Group company in a statement on Friday.
With no respite from high energy prices and rupee depreciation in sight, the company may continue to face pressure and will not be able to pass on the cost increase to customers. Supply is expected to continue to outstrip demand some time, said an analyst.
The Scheme of Arrangement to merge the cement business of Century Textiles and Industries is awaiting approval from shareholders, the National Company Law Tribunal and other regulatory authorities. It has been cleared by stock exchanges and Competition Commission of India.
Following approvals, UltraTech Cement will issue one equity share for every eight held by Century Textiles shareholders.
Century will demerge its cement business consisting of three integrated cement units in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra and a grinding unit in West Bengal and merge it with Ultratech. This will take, UltraTech Cement’s capacity to 111.1 mtpa.
Having integrated 21.2 mtpa of JP Cement capacity acquired last July, UltraTech proposes to invest in Waste Heat Recovery Systems at these plants, said the company."

A two-member Bench of NCLAT, headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya, approved UltraTech’s resolution plan and said that the plan submitted by the rival Dalmia Bharat group firm, Rajputana Properties, was discriminatory against some financial creditors.




A two-member Bench of NCLAT, headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya, approved UltraTech’s resolution plan and said that the plan submitted by the rival Dalmia Bharat group firm, Rajputana Properties, was discriminatory against some financial creditors.


Ending months of uncertainty, the National Company Law and Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Thursday approved UltraTech Cement bid of ₹7,900 crore for stressed Binani Cement rejecting the offer of ₹6,930 crore by Dalmia Bharat-Bain Piramal consortium Rajputana Properties, though it was declared as highest bidder by the Committee of Creditors earlier.
In a 44-page order, justices SJ Mukhopadhaya, Chairperson, and Bansi Lal Bhat, Member, NCLAT, said the revised resolution plan submitted by Ultratech Cement approved by the Committee of Creditors meets the requirements and the plan shall be binding on the corporate debtor and its employees, members, creditors, guarantors and other stakeholders involved in the resolution plan.
The Appellate Tribunal also directed the adjudicating authority to constitute a monitoring committee to implement the revised approved plan of Ultratech Cement in accordance with law.
Suitors and their bids
Binani Cement is a subsidiary of Binani Industries with a stake of 98.43 per cent. It owed over ₹6,000 crore and was admitted into the Kolkata bench of NCLT for insolvency and bankruptcy process last year. Two companies emerged as top bidders — Rajputana Properties and Ultratech Cement.
Initially, the Aditya Birla Group company UltraTech Cement had placed a bid of ₹6,500 crore for Binani Cement, much lower than that of the Dalmia Bharat Cement. After Dalmia Bharat Cement was announced the highest bidder, UltraTech revised its offer by ₹700 crore to ₹7,200 crore and further to ₹7,840 crore, thus covering the entire debt and interest of all the debtors.
Dalmia Bharat Cement did not revise its offer even after getting an opportunity from CoC. Finally, the CoC approved UltraTech as the highest bidder and submitted the plan to NCLT for approval.
In July, hearing a petition filed by Dalmia Bharat, the Supreme Court had transferred multiple cases relating to corporate insolvency of Binani Cement to the NCLAT from National Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata, for fast tracking the process.
NCLAT judgement said the CoC consisting of the financial creditors encumbered with public money ought to act in the interest of maximisation of asset value. As per IBC, the CoC has the discretionary power to take the best decision, within the stipulated timeframe, to best suit the interests of the creditors and the public money involved in the process, it said.
Dhaval Vussonji of Dhaval Vussonji & Associates, who is representing the operational creditor at NCLAT told BusinessLine that as per the plan approved by the Appellate Tribunal the entire dues of about ₹450 crore of Operational Creditors will be paid in 30 days from the date of sanction.
NCLAT also rejected Binani Cement promoters application to withdraw the insolvency proceedings for an out-of-court settlement stating the provision has come into force on June 6 much after the impugned order was passed on May 2.
Moreover, it said the applicant has not filed the withdrawal application after taking approval from 90 per cent voting share of the CoC."

 The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear on November 19 the plea of a Dalmia Bharat Group firm challenging the NCLAT’s order allowing rival UltraTech Cement to acquire debt-ridden Binani Cement.
The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Wednesday allowed the Aditya Birla group firm to acquire Binani Cement by approving its revised Rs 7,950.34 crore bid over an offer by Rajputana Properties. 
A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi considered the submissions of lawyer Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Rajputana Properties, that the appeal against the order of the tribunal be heard urgently. “List it on Monday,” said the bench, which also comprised justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph. 
NCLAT approved UltraTech’s resolution plan for Binani and rejected the resolution plan submitted by Dalmia Bharat’s Rajputana Properties by terming it “discriminatory” and “unbalanced”. The Aditya Birla Group firm has not only paid the financial lenders of debt-ridden Binani but also its operational creditors.
The panel had observed that the plan submitted by Rajputana discriminated between “equally situated” financial creditors and did not balance other stakeholders such as the operational creditors of Binani Cement.
Rajputana had moved the appellate tribunal against the May 2 order of the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that allowed the Resolution Professional and Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Binani to consider UltraTech’s revised offer while affording Rajputana an opportunity to revise its resolution plan.
The CoC had earlier approved Rajputana’s Rs 6,932.4-crore bid, but the decision was changed once UltraTech revised its offer.
NCLAT observed that the amended offer of UltraTech Cement has got 100 per cent voting from the CoC and added that the intent of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was maximisation of the value of assets.
“We approve the revised resolution plan submitted by UltraTech Cement which shall be binding on the corporate debtor (Binani Cement) and its employees, members, creditors, guarantors and other stakeholders involved in the Resolution Plan,” the NCLAT order had said.
NCLAT had also dismissed the plea of promoters of Binani Industries for termination of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process after settling the dues with lenders under section 12 A of the IBC, saying that the application did not have the requisite 90 per cent voting share of the CoC. “Binani Industries cannot take advantage of Section 12A nor can be allowed to settle the matter,” said the NCLAT bench.
UltraTech is the leading cement manufacturer of the country with an installed capacity of 96.5 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) of grey cement. It is already merging the cement business of BK Birla Group company Century Textiles and Industries, which has a capacity of 11.4 MTPA.
In its 44-page-long order, NCLAT observed that financial creditors such as “Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company, IDBI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, Bank of India and State Bank of India have been provided with 100 per cent of their verified claim” but the resolution applicant Rajputana Properties has given “lesser percentage to Export-Import Bank of India 72.59 per cent and State Bank of India-Hong Kong 10 per cent“.
On the other hand, the resolution plan submitted by UltraTech allows “maximization of assets of the Corporate Debtor (Binani Cement) while some amount of working capital has been infused (Rs 350 crores) and all the financial creditors and the Operational Creditors have been paid 100 per cent of dues except the related parties,” the had order said.
The CoC had also asked Rajputana Properties to revise its offer of Rs 6932.4 crore. UltraTech Cement’s revised offer was Rs 7,950.34 crore, against its earlier bid of Rs 7,200 crore."
26,2018-11-18,UltraTech,"A landmark decision
The long drawn battle between Dalmia Bharat group’s Rajputana Properties and the Aditya Birla Group-led UltraTech Cement, to acquire Binani Cement made significant headway recently, with the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) approving UltraTech’s bid for the debt-laden company. At the heart of the dispute has been UltraTech’s presumably late, but higher bid of ₹7,950 crore that came in after the committee of creditors (CoC) had approved Dalmia Bharat’s lower bid of ₹6,930 crore. This had raised niggling concerns on the sanctity of the IBC process, as late bids could lead to endless negotiations and a losing bidder, as it appeared then, could undesirably strike a cosy deal outside the IBC system. But interestingly the 44-page NCLAT order has shed a different light on the crux of the issue. According to the findings of the adjudicating authority, the CoC had, in fact, ignored the revised bid by UltraTech submitted much before the approval of Dalmia’s plan, thereby failing to realise the intended purpose of resolution — one of maximisation of value for all stakeholders. The NCLAT also found that the CoC had failed to safeguard the interest of all stakeholders even while approving the resolution plan of Dalmia Bharat. By noting that a lesser percentage of claim was given to a certain set of similar creditors, the NCLAT found Dalmia Bharat’s resolution plan ‘discriminatory’ against some operational and financial creditors. 
The landmark decision by NCLAT, aside from clarifying key issues in the Binani Cement case, has set a precedent for future cases under IBC, by re-iterating key aspects of the Code. For instance, the NCLAT has re-affirmed that the insolvency process must seek to extract maximum value from resolution of stressed assets and ensure that interests of operational creditors (who are not part of CoC) are also well served. The NCLAT’s emphasis that an insolvency application once filed cannot be withdrawn at a later date merely because the promoter of the financially stressed company has offered to pay all outstanding dues, will have an important bearing on the ongoing Essar Steel case. 
That said, the NCLAT ruling that has held Dalmia’s plan as ‘discriminatory’ has opened up a Pandora’s box on the grounds on which the Appellate Authority can reject a resolution plan. But the larger issue of disputes and interventions delaying the IBC process remains. While it is imperative that adjudicating authorities settle points of law and ensure that interests of all stakeholders are safeguarded, it is also vital that cases are resolved quickly. According to IBBI data up to September 2018, of the 1,198 cases under insolvency, only 52 have seen approval of resolution plan. While Dalmia has moved the Supreme Court against the NCLAT order, avoiding excessive delay is essential to maintaining the sanctity of the Code."

The Supreme Court on Monday upheld an earlier National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order, in turn, approving sale of Binani Cement to UltraTech Cement.
The petition was filed before the Supreme Court by Dalmia Bharat’s Rajputana Properties challenging an earlier NCLAT order.
A bench of justices Rohinton Nariman and Navin Sinha dismissed the plea.
""It looks like it’s the final settlement in the Dalmia case. The two important principles, which came out in the NCLAT order, was upheld by the Supreme Court,” Dhaval Vussonji of Dhaval Vussonji & Associates, who represented operational creditors in the Supreme Court told BusinessLine.
“The two important principles were maximisation of value and there should not be discrimination between creditors,” he added.

In a move that could have major implications for ongoing insolvency proceedings, the Supreme Court has approved the revised offer of UltraTech Cement to acquire Binani Cement.
Rejecting the petition filed by Dalmia Cement’s Rajputana Properties challenging the order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, the Bench of Justices Rohinton Nariman and Navin Sinha said, “there was no infirmity in approval granted by the NCLAT’.
“The two important principles of maximisation of value and equality among creditors, which came out in the NCLAT order, was upheld by the Supreme Court,” Dhaval Vussonji of Dhaval Vussonji and Associates, who represented operational creditors in the Supreme Court, told BusinessLine.
Dalmia Cement on Thursday filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the NCLAT order approving UltraTech’s ₹7,900-crore offer as the highest bidder for buying out the stressed Binani Cement asset. Initially, Dalmia Bharat-Bain Piramal consortium Rajputana Properties’ bid of ₹6,930 crore was declared the highest bid by the Committee of Creditors for Binani Cement ahead of UltraTech Cement’s offer of ₹6,500 crore.
However, just before the CoC issued a letter of intent to Rajputana Properties, UltraTech revised its offer by ₹700 crore to ₹7,200 crore and further to ₹7,840 crore, thus covering the entire debt and interest of all the debtors.
Dalmia Bharat Cement did not revise its offer even after getting an opportunity from the CoC.
The apex court’s ruling could have implications for other cases under the IBC, including Essar Steel, where its existing promoters Ruias have offered a last-minute counter bid beating the offer made by ArcelorMittal.

23,2018-11-20,UltraTech,"With Binani in the bag, UltraTech matches Shree Cement as topper in the North


UltraTech Cement will catapult to match the largest cement producer in the northern region comprising Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana after the long court-driven acquisition of Binani Cement. Post the deal, the installed capacity of UltraTech will increase to 24 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), similar to that of Shree Cement.
Production capacity share of UltraTech in the northern region will increase to 24 per cent from 17 per cent. Ultratech and Shree Cement will account for 45 per cent of total installed capacity in the region.
Lafarge-Holcim owned Ambuja Cements will be the third largest producer in the North with 10 million tonnes, followed by JK Lakshmi and JK Cement with 7.5 million tonnes each.
The top five players will together account for 70 per cent of the total installed capacity, implying strong market consolidation in the northern region, said Rajesh Kumar Ravi, Research Analyst, Centrum Broking.
He said Binani Cement delivered an Ebitda per tonne of ₹700 between FY10 and FY13 before high debt gearing and costlier working capital dragged down its utilisation and profitability, finally leading to insolvency.
With a strong brand recall and quality output, UltraTech should put back Binani Cement to generate an Ebitda of ₹700-800 a tonne level sooner than later.
Overall, Binani Cement has a global manufacturing capacity of 11.25 mtpa with a domestic capacity of 6.25 mtpa and an integrated plant in China and grinding units in Dubai.
Acquisition of Binani will also add about 2 mtpa capacity to UltraTech in Gujarat, thereby strengthening its leadership position with production capacity of 40 per cent in the State.
Binani Cement was operating the Gujarat plant at 30-40 per cent capacity utilisation and incremental volume from capacity ramp up will boost market consolidation leading to price stability in both the northern and Gujarat markets.
The overall demand in the North and Gujarat is estimated at 75 mtpa.
On the other hand, Ravi said if Dalmia Bharat were to acquire Binani Cement, the influx of a new brand would have led to volatility in price as Dalmia is not present in the northern markets.
While losing the race for Binani Cement may delay Dalmia’s aspiration to become a pan-India player, it can focus on its large on-going expansions in the East to strengthen its position with a better balance sheet."

Binani Cement has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of UltraTech Cement, an Aditya Birla Group company, effective Tuesday. This follows Supreme Court’s ruling on Monday upholding a National Company law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order that approved the Aditya Birla group company’s offer to pay about ₹8,000 crore for the stressed asset of Binani Cement in an insolvency-driven process.
The board of UltraTech, at its meeting held on Monday, approved the company’s proposal to make Binani Cement a wholly-owned subsidiary from Tuesday, said UltraTech in a statement on Wednesday.
UltraTech has acquired Binani Cement’s 6.25-million tonnes per annum (mtpa) plant in Rajasthan, including an integrated cement unit and a split grinding unit, for ₹8,024 crore. This acquisition gives the company access to superior-quality limestone reserves. Binani’s subsidiaries in China and the UAE also stand transferred to UltraTech. 
To make the integration process smooth, UltraTech has appointed G Balasubramaniam, former Unit Head, Awarpur, as Head of Binani Cement’s integrated cement units. The operations at the acquired asset would be led by Sudeep Grover and Raju Anklesaria, head of UltraTech’s North and West zone operations.

After remaining listless for long, most cement stocks gained on Friday on expectations the government would slash the GST on construction items, including cement, to 18 per cent from 28 per cent at its meeting next week.
Shares of the country’s largest cement producer UltraTech Cement and Shree Cement were up 1 per cent each at ₹3,998 and ₹16,935, respectively. India Cements and Orient Cement gained 2 per cent each at ₹94 and ₹80, respectively. Ambuja Cements and Ramco Cement were up marginally at ₹219 and ₹630, respectively.
Kabir Rai, Research Analyst, IndiaNivesh Securities, said the benefit of lower GST rate may not be passed on entirely to the trade segment.
On the other hand, he added, the change in GST rates will not impact the supply-demand equilibrium as demand in this sector is primarily driven by infrastructure projects and rural housing initiatives of the government which will not change materially by the price adjustments.
The rising production cost amid weak demand has squeezed the profitability of cement companies. Some of the cement companies are still expanding their capacity to maintain their market share when demand revives.
Ambuja Cements recently topped up its ₹1,390-crore expansion plan in Rajasthan with an additional investment of ₹960 crore.
It will set up additional 1.4 million tonne clinker capacity, and grinding facility of 1.8 mt along with a captive power plant and waste heat recovery system at Marwar Mundwa in Rajasthan.
While the cut in GST on cement is expected to bring down prices, the excess supply overhang in the market may weigh heavily even as demand is limping back after the washout during the monsoon season last quarter, said an analyst.
The government’s intention to retain only luxury items and demerit goods in the 28 per cent slab has got a shot in the arm after the recent election debacle, he added.
The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising State counterparts, has already pruned the the number of items in the 28 per cent slab by 191 goods over the last one-and-a-half year, leaving only 35 items in the highest slab."

Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
I bought shares of UltraTech Cement at ₹3,900. What is the outlook?
TVS Prakash RaoUltraTech Cement (₹3,982.1): Since taking support at ₹3,263 in late October, the stock of UltraTech Cement has been on a medium-term uptrend.
However, it encountered a key resistance at ₹4,100 in late November and continues to test this level.
An emphatic break above this resistance is required to strengthen the uptrend and take the stock northwards to ₹4,300 and ₹4,500 in the short to medium term. But failure to move beyond the current medium-term resistance can keep the stock consolidating sideways in the ₹3,700-₹4,100 range for a while.
A strong plunge below ₹3,700 will bring back selling pressure and drag the stock down to ₹3,500 and ₹3,300 in the medium term.
Consider exiting the stock if it fails to move beyond ₹4,100 this week and re-enter at lower levels later.
The stock has been on a wide sideways consolidation phase between ₹3,600 and ₹4,500 since early 2017.
The key resistance at ₹4,500 has capped the upside for the stock in January 2018 and in August.
A strong break above this level is needed to strengthen the bullish momentum and take the stock higher to ₹4,700 and ₹5,000 in the long run.
Investors with a long-term horizon can stay invested with a stop-loss at ₹3,400 levels.
I have shares of 8K Miles Software Services. What are the major support and resistance levels for the stock?
Pradeep Kabra
8K Miles Software Services (₹155.6): Ever since recording a new high at ₹1,024, the stock has been on a long-term downtrend, forming lower peaks and troughs.
From July this year, the stock began to move circuit to circuit, without providing traders an opportunity to buy or sell it.








 
 
In early November, the stock registered a 52-week low at ₹55 and reversed direction.
Since then, it has been on a short-term uptrend. Key supports are at ₹125 and ₹100.
A decisive fall below ₹100 can drag the stock down to ₹60 in the medium term. On the upside, major resistances are placed at ₹200, ₹250 and ₹300 levels. Investors should desist taking positions in these kind of circuit to circuit hitting stocks.

We have managed to reduce costs by 8-10 per cent last quarter compared to the December quarter by negotiating better prices on our raw material purchases. There are specific projects being executed in the acquired Binani and JP Cement assets that will bring down costs by ₹50 a tonne this quarter.
Have you managed to increase prices with strong demand?
Prices have remained stable despite robust demand. In a few States it has actually corrected itself due to a slowdown in demand on the back of elections. We are seeing a pick-up in demand from mid-income housing projects but demand from luxury housing projects is yet to recover.
What will be your capital expenditure this fiscal?
We will be spending about ₹1,500 crore this fiscal. The capex will largely be on efficiency improvement across plants. No fresh capacity is being added. We have already reduced the cost of operations at Binani plants by ₹200 a tonne.
An increase in capacity utilisation along with efficiency improvement will add to the bottomline.
What is stopping companies from putting in fresh capacity if the demand is expected to be robust?
The fresh capacity addition has slowed down to less than 3 per cent. Most of the cement companies have stressed balance-sheets. Moreover, the cost of acquiring limestone mines through an open auction has become a costly affair.
Has the problem of supply exceeding demand eased?
With the demand improving and fresh capacity additions slowing, the mismatch between demand and supply has eased. However, we have a long way to go before this issue is resolved. The overall demand in India is estimated at 340 million tonnes while the industry capacity is 480 mt.
How much will you realise from the sale of overseas assets?
We have just started the process of sale and it is very difficult to put a number on the deal size. The assets that we are planning to sell are part of Binani Cement. They had 2 mt capacity in the UAE and 3 mt in China.
We have also put on the block Binani’s fibreglass manufacturing facility in Europe. The unit has an Ebitda of ₹300 crore.
When do you expect to complete the Century Textile cement asset buy?
It is very difficult to set a timeline for the completion of the deal, but we are ready with the integration plan. The next hearing of the NCLT is on May 3 and the final order is expected in June.
The transfer of limestone mines will be concluded after the final order from the NCLT. The limestone mines of Binani Cement have been retained as a separate entity and are now a subsidiary of UltraTech Cement."

12,2019-05-02,UltraTech,"UltraTech’s task now is to sell Binani’s assets


UltraTech Cement, an Aditya Birla Group company, will have to be mindful of country specific regulations and seek consent of joint venture partners as it looks to sell the associated global assets it inherited with the recent acquisition of Binani Cement in an insolvency-driven process.
The global assets that UltraTech plans to sell include the Binani 3B - the Fibreglass Company, with plants in Europe and Goa; a three-million tonne per annum (mtpa) joint venture cement plant in China; and a 2.5 mtpa grinding unit in the UAE. Binani Cement owned a 90 per cent stake the China JV and 49 per cent in the UAE venture.
 3B is wholly owned by the Braj Binani Group.
As the fibreglass company was not part of the insolvency process in India, UltraTech has to file a fresh insolvency case, under European laws.. For the other two assets it has to find a buyer approved by joint venture partners.
 Before filing for insolvency, the Binani Group had tried to sell its stake in the cement venture to its Chinese partner, who refused to acquire it, sources said.
Finding a buyer for the grinding unit in the UAE is also difficult, as the cement supply there greatly exceeds demand.
In 2012, Binani Cement had given a corporate guarantee to raise ₹1,600 crore from IDBI Bank for acquiring the fibre-glass company. As part of the insolvency process, UltraTech has cleared the loan in full, and taken over the loan portfolio. 
The fibre-glass plant has now defaulted on the first quarter interest payment of ₹40 crore, prompting UltraTech to sell the asset. 
UltraTech cannot sell the unit directly, and has to initiate a separate process under the European law, said a merchant banker tracking the development.
In response to a BusinessLine questionnaire, UltraTech said the company has stepped into the shoes of lenders in all respects, including securities against the loan amount.
The enforcement of securities is governed by loan covenants. It will be UltraTech’s endeavour to recover their outstanding loan by enforcing securities in accordance with the loan agreements, the company added.
Without getting into specifics of any deal, Uday Bhansali, President (Financial Advisory), Deloitte, said the resolution professional has details of the insolvent parent company’s shareholding in its foreign subsidiary. The bidders also assign a value to the foreign asset, regardless of whether they want to retain it..
In case of the joint venture, he added, the winning bidder has the right to the extent of his shareholding in the foreign asset.
As per market estimates, if UltraTech manages to sell all the three assets, it will recover close to half of the ₹7,900 crore paid for the acquisition of Binani Cement, said an analyst.
“At this point, it would be hazardous even to guess the market value of securities held by UltraTech against the loan. The securities held against the loan are only for securing outstanding loan amount.UltraTech is not entitled to retain any amount in excess of their outstanding loan amount,” said UltraTech."
11,2019-06-07,UltraTech,"By 2021, UltraTech aims to source 25% of energy from renewable sources 
 UltraTech Cement plans to generate over 650 million units of renewable power with a target to increase the contribution of green energy to 25 per cent of its total power consumption by 2021. The targeted increase is more than double the current 10 per cent. 
To achieve the objective, UltraTech plans to increase its Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS) capacity, enabling a low carbon product mix through thermal substitution, the company said in a statement.
The use of renewable power for UltraTech’s energy requirements will result in annual carbon emission reduction of 533,000 tonnes of CO2, and in 25 years’ total carbon footprint reduction of 13 million tonnes. With this, UltraTech will be among the largest users of renewable energy in the Indian cement sector, it said.
Last fiscal, UltraTech commissioned 28 MW of WHRS, taking its generation from the system to 8 per cent of total power consumption. There are more investments in progress which are expected to be completed in a phased manner by 2021, taking WHRS to 15 per cent of total power requirement, the statement said.
The benefits include a reduction in the cost per unit of power, as WHRS can bring it down to ₹0.50 from the existing thermal power cost of ₹4 per unit, it added.
KK Maheshwari, Managing Director, UltraTech, said the cement sector’s annual emissions need to come down by at least 16 per cent by 2030 to bring it in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change."

UltraTech’s Chairman and Non-Executive Director Kumar Mangalam Birla received an annual remuneration Rs 15.53 crore in FY 2018-19, down 18.82 per cent over the year-ago period, even as the largest cement producer posted a double digit growth in its topline.
Birla, 52, had received an annual salary of Rs 19.13 crore in FY 2017-18.
Since the last two years, Birla’s remuneration is on a decline. In FY 2016-17, Birla had received Rs 22.50 crore.
Notwithstanding this decline, Birla’s salary was 202.9 times higher than the median remuneration paid to UltraTech employees in FY 2018-19, according to the company’s latest annual report.
Earlier, it was 387.9 times higher in FY 2016-17 and 375.2 times in FY 2017-18 respectively, against the median remuneration of UltraTech employees.
“The median remuneration of employees of the company during the financial year was Rs 7.65 lakh,” said the annual report.
It added that in the financial year, there was an increase of 8.5 per cent in the median remuneration of employees.
Besides, UltraTech Managing Director K K Maheshwari also took 4.76 per cent lesser salary at Rs 12.96 crore in the last fiscal year, ended March 31, 2019.
“Average percentage increase made in the salaries of employees other than the managerial personnel, in the last financial year 2018-19 was 8.8 per cent whereas decline in the managerial remuneration for the same financial year was 11.8 per cent,” the UltraTech Annual Report 2018-19 said.
UltraTech, had 19,557 permanent employees on its rolls as on March 31, 2019.
The company has 21 integrated plants in 2019 with a installed capacity of 102.8 million tons per annum (MTPA).
For FY 2018-19, UltraTech net turnover on consolidated basis was at Rs 36,775 crore and profit after tax was at Rs 2,432 crore.
The company has acquired Binani Cement, which has an installed capacity of 6.25 mtpa and renamed as UltraTech Nathdwara Cement in FY 2018-19.
“In the next fiscal, with the acquisition of Century Cement, we expect UltraTech’s installed capacity to scale up to over 113 mtpa,” Birla said.
The company expects a growth of around 8 per cent in this ongoing fiscal led by government’s renewed thrust on infrastructure development through the construction of roads, metro rail projects, airports renovation, irrigation projects.
“We remain optimistic in our outlook for the cement sector in FY20 and expect the industry to grow at 7 to 8 per cent,” said Birla."

The sector has witnessed consolidation with large cement makers taking over regional heavyweights.




The sector has witnessed consolidation with large cement makers taking over regional heavyweights.


Favourable demand and consolidation in the cement industry are expected to bring down the stressed advances ratio from the current 14.2 per cent, as banks put more bad debts on the block.
The outstanding credit to the sector is pegged at ₹55,348 crore. The stressed advances peaked to 35 per cent in FY17, according to Care Rating.
The sector has witnessed consolidation with large cement makers taking over regional heavyweights, and struggling companies being taken over through competitive bidding, under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
UltraTech Cement is one of the major beneficiaries of the stressed asset buying. It bought over 22 million tonne per annum capacity of Jaypee Cement and acquired Binani Cement’s 12 mtpa through an IBC-driven insolvency process.
Detergent maker Nirma acquired 13 mtpa of Lafarge India assets, while Birla Corporation took over 5.5 mtpa capacity of Reliance Cement capacity.
Companies are consolidating and expanding to improve their market shares in existing products and to enter new product segments. 
It not only cuts costs, but eases the process of not having to set-up a new plant and arrange for approvals and rights, thus saving on valuable time, said Care Ratings.
The acquisition of existing cement assets is a cost-effective way for the existing players to expand into newer markets, it added. Cement companies have added fresh capacity of 25 mtpa last fiscal, putting pressure on capacity utilisation, which has stablished at 70 per cent. The production capacity of the industry has increased to 480 mtpa last fiscal from 328 mtpa logged in FY12.
Last fiscal, the industry registered the highest-ever production growth of 13 per cent in the last decade. The output was up at 337 mt last fiscal against 298 mt in the same period the previous year.
The rating agency expects cement production to remain steady with growth of 5-7 per cent this fiscal. While prices may remain stable, a revival in retail demand is expected to push up prices, it said.
Increased government spending and incentives to housing, especially in the affordable segment, should lead to steady growth rate in the sector from this fiscal, it added."

UltraTech Cement Ltd , an Aditya Birla Group company, has reported a 91 per cent increase in Q1 FY20 net profit at ₹1,208 crore, against ₹631 crore in the same period last year on better realisation and lower operational cost.
Net sales were up 15 per cent at ₹10,027 crore (₹8,720 crore) despite the sales volume being flat. Sales were up just 2 per cent at 17.86 million tonne (17.48 mt) due to depressed demand.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation was up 63 per cent at ₹2,652 crore (₹1,624 crore). Expenses on logistics, which account for 32 per cent of the overall cost, were down 5 per cent at ₹1,140 a tonne due to lower diesel prices and revised axle norms. Similarly, energy and raw material costs were down 2 per cent each to ₹1,011 a tonne and ₹489 a tonne respectively due to lower energy consumption and procurement source optimisation, said the company.
The logistics cost would have reduced further if the availability of railway wagons had improved. The share of dispatches through railways was down to 21 per cent.
Overall, cost reduction improved the realisation to ₹251 per 50 kg bag (₹221 per bag).
The company has managed to turn around the 21.2 mtpa Jaypee Cement asset acquired in 2017 and achieve a breakeven at the operational level, it said.

Dalmia Cement has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order approving the revised bid placed by UltraTech Cement as the highest bidder for buying out the stressed Binani Cement asset.
The case will come up for hearing on Monday (November 19), said Mahendra Singhi, Managing Director and CEO, Dalmia Cement (Bharat), without committing on whether the company will raise its bid to match that of UltraTech Cement.
On Wednesday, NCLAT approved UltraTech Cement’s revised bid of ₹7,900 crore for Binani Cement over an offer of ₹6,930 crore by Rajputana Properties, though it was declared as highest bidder by the Committee of Creditors earlier.
The Aditya Birla Group company UltraTech Cement initially placed a bid of ₹6,500 crore for Binani Cement, much lower than that made by Dalmia Bharat Cement. However, UltraTech revised its offer by ₹700 crore to ₹7,200 crore and further to ₹7,840 crore, thus covering the entire debt and interest of all the debtors.
Dalmia Cement did not revise its offer even after getting an opportunity from CoC. Finally, the CoC approved UltraTech as the highest bidder and submitted the plan to NCLT for approval.
In July, Dalmia Cement filed a petition in the Supreme Court against NCLT order declaring UltraTech as the highest bidder. Hearing the petition, the apex court transferred multiple cases relating to corporate insolvency of Binani Cement to the NCLAT from National Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata, for faster resolution."
3,2019-09-29,UltraTech,"5 value stocks for you 
New vehicle sales volumes, which grew at 14 per cent in 2017-18, slowed to 5 per cent in 2018-19 and further plunged by 15 per cent in the first five months of this fiscal. This slowdown, along with market volatility, has seen many auto and auto component stocks take a knock in the past year. Despite the stimulus measures announced by the government to boost auto sales, the sector may not come out of the downturn in a hurry. Corporate tax cuts will also take time to show up as accretions to earnings.
The ongoing discounts, good monsoon and the upcoming festival season may boost demand to an extent. But the transition to BS-VI fuel emission norms on April 1, 2020, high transaction costs arising from compulsory multi-year third-party insurance, increase in road taxes in some states, etc still remain dampeners. Commercial vehicle sales too may gain strength only after economic activity gathers momentum.
In this backdrop, tyre and battery manufacturers which have sizeable after-market sales can ride the slowdown better. This is because tyres and batteries need to be replaced every three to four years in existing vehicles. Exide Industries is one such company.
The stock has dropped about 30 per cent in the last year. It now trades at about 19 times its trailing 12-month earnings, lower than Amara Raja Batteries (24 times) as well as Exide’s own three-year historical average of 25 times.
Over the last few years, the company has taken measures to strengthen its market share in the automotive replacement segment. These include higher support to dealers, improvement in after-sales service, faster turnaround in warranty claims, and launch of new products.
Compliance requirements under the GST will bring down the price advantage that unorganised battery-makers currently enjoy. This is expected to increase demand for organised players such as Exide, especially in the commercial vehicles and tractors segment.
Exide is well-placed to catch up when new vehicle sales pick up. It counts almost all leading auto manufacturers among its clients.
The company has also taken steps to tackle the shift to electric vehicles. It has entered into a joint venture with Switzerland-based Leclanché to build lithium-ion batteries. A lithium-ion cell production plant is expected to be in operation by mid-2020. Exide has already introduced batteries for e-rickshaws.
In the quarter-ended June 2019, net sales remained somewhat flat at ₹2,779 crore over the June 2018 quarter. Net profits inched up by 7 per cent to ₹225 crore.
Operating margins came in at 14.6 per cent, a tad higher than 14.1 per cent last year. Prices of lead — the key raw material — hover at around $2,000 a tonne currently. It is not expected to spike sharply, given the slowdown in Chinese demand. The company is debt-free.
Since end-May, the stock of gas transmission major GAIL (India) has fallen more than 25 per cent. While the post-Budget market weakness played a part, the stock was also dragged down by some company-specific factors.
One, the tariff hike announced by downstream regulator PNGRB for GAIL’s key HVJ pipeline was below expectations. Next, low global gas prices raised concerns about the prospects of the gas trading business, given that the company has entered into long-term contracts to procure US LNG cargoes. Also, the decline in global crude oil prices affected the profitability of the petrochemicals and LPG segments.
This, along with a planned shutdown in the petrochemical business and subdued gas transmission volumes, resulted in a muted June quarter performance by the company. Besides, the overhang of a possible separation of the company’s gas transmission business from its gas marketing business continued to weigh down the stock.
The dip in the share price though presents a good value-buying opportunity. For one, the stock’s valuation is quite attractive. At ₹134, it trades at about 10 times its trailing 12-month earnings, compared with its three-year average of about 17 times. The current dividend yield on the stock is about 5 per cent. Also, the business concerns seem overdone.
The company has said that it is adequately hedged on its US LNG contracts. This should help the gas trading segment to perform well, as it did in the June quarter. Gas transmission volumes had declined in the June quarter due to planned shutdowns in some user industries.
Volume growth is expected to pick up over the coming year with more imported gas expected to come in through LNG terminals and completion of new pipelines. Also, the domestic gas output, if it improves, will aid GAIL’s transmission business. Higher volumes should mitigate the impact of the lower-than-expected tariff hike.
Petchem volumes should also pick up with the plant resuming operations. It is not clear if and when the separation of the company’s gas transmission and gas marketing businesses will take place. In any case, shareholders of GAIL (India) will have stake in the restructured businesses. The Centre’s push to increase the share of natural gas in India’s energy mix should help GAIL — the country’s largest gas utility.
The company’s consolidated profit in FY 2019 grew 36 per cent to ₹6,546 crore. The recent cut in corporate tax rates will help GAIL by reducing its effective tax rate.
The stock of Brigade Enterprises, a Bengaluru-based realty company, has gained over 50 per cent in the last one year. But it offers value at this juncture as it trades at 16 times its trailing 12-month earnings, lower than the average of 18 times it had traded at in the past three years.
While the tight liquidity situation, coupled with the slowdown in consumption, has played spoilsport with recovery in the real-estate sector, Brigade has reported strong sales in the residential segment. It registered 83 per cent Y-o-Y new sales (value) growth in FY19. This is thanks to the Bengaluru market drawing more working population, leading to incremental residential demand.
Over 70 per cent of the company’s projects are in Bengaluru and across diverse segments such as residential, office, retail (mall) and hotels. For the June quarter 2019, the new sales (value) rose to ₹593 crore from ₹295 crore last year during the same period. This is mainly attributed to the strong demand in mid-income and affordable housing segment, given that nearly 80 per cent of the company’s on-going and completed projects are in the less than ₹1-crore ticket size. The strong launch pipeline and operational rental portfolio in Bengaluru are expected to help the company’s earnings.
The company has recently launched 0.64 million sq ft of residential projects in the June quarter, of which 0.52 million sq ft are affordable housing projects. With robust volumes in this space and quicker project completion, the company’s earnings are expected to improve. The impact of recent corporate tax rate cut could be low on Brigade as the effective tax works out to about 23 per cent for FY19. However, other incentives by the Centre for players in the affordable housing segment are positives for the company.
The competitive pricing of its units and favourable location of the residential projects bode well for the company’s realisation. The average price realisation rose 2 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹5,244 per sq ft in the June quarter when players such as Sobha registered a decline of nearly 8 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹7,312 per sq ft for the same period.
Further, given the strong demand for office space, particularly in Bengaluru where the rental income grew 14 per cent, the company is steadily increasing its commercial projects.
For the June quarter, it launched three commercial projects totalling one million sq ft. During the same period, the company was able to lease 0.77 million sq ft, which is expected to yield rental income of ₹66 crore per annum.
Brigade has planned new project launches; 2.6 million sq ft of commercial projects and 6.4 million sq ft of residential projects in the coming quarters.
The NBFC turmoil over the past year has hit most stocks within the space. Sluggishness in disbursements, overall slowdown in the economy and pressure on profitability owing to rise in cost of funds, can continue to keep stocks under pressure in the near term. But for long-term investors, it presents a good opportunity to buy quality stocks. Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company has a well-established track record in the vehicle financing business (constituting 75 per cent of the overall assets under management).
Being part of the Murugappa Group, the company derives good operational/financial support from group companies. The company’s disbursements have grown by a robust 23 per cent CAGR between FY16 and FY19; in FY19 too, despite the challenging environment, the company’s disbursements grew by a strong 21 per cent, with both vehicle financing and loan against property (LAP) doing well.
Even in the latest June quarter, the company’s disbursements continued to grow by 22 per cent, despite the slowdown in the auto industry. Disbursements in the vehicle finance business grew by about 22 per cent, thanks to a well-diversified loan book across the spectrum in the automotive sector. In the current scenario of slowdown in the heavy vehicle and car segment, the company’s diversification into two-wheelers and focus on the used vehicle business, have aided growth. While near-term disruptions are likely and disbursement growth may moderate owing to the weak demand in the underlying segment, the company’s sound financials and portfolio mix should mitigate the pain. The management has guided for a 15 per cent growth in disbursement in FY20.
Overall, the company’s asset quality has been stable, with GNPAs at 2.6 per cent of loans. However, higher stress in the LAP segment warrants a watch. There has been a rise in delinquencies, post-demonetisation, in the LAP segment that constitutes 21 per cent of loans.
But constant efforts to resolve accounts through SARFAESI have helped bring down GNPAs in the segment. A lower loan-to-value of 50-52 per cent and chunk of the book (80 per cent) being self-occupied residential property have helped the company mitigate the risk.
On the liquidity front, the company has been comfortable. Its asset liability was well-matched as of June 2019. Its net interest margins (NIMs) have fallen by 60 bps Y-o-Y in the June quarter, owing to rise in the cost of funds and higher liquid assets (about ₹5,300 crore as of June 2019 to mitigate the tight liquidity conditions).
While focussing on high-yielding businesses can aid margins, near-term pressure can continue. Nonetheless, the company’s strong profitability — return of equity at 20 per cent — is a key positive. The recent cut in corporate tax rate would also help propel earnings. The company’s effective tax rate was 39 per cent in FY19 (current tax/PBT). However, it would need to raise capital to fund its growth over the next two years.
After coming under pressure in the beginning of the year, the stock has rallied over the past two months.
At the current price, it trades at about 2.6 times its expected FY20 book value, lower than its three-year historical average of about 3.2 times.
Cement manufacturers have seen healthy realisations (revenue per tonne) on account of rising demand, post the Centre’s increased thrust on infrastructure and affordable housing. The pan-India cement prices peaked to almost ₹370 a bag (50 kg) in May-June 2019. From there, the prices have dipped marginally to about ₹340 a bag in August, which is still 7-8 per cent higher on a Y-o-Y basis.
With a domestic capacity of 98.8 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) — 21 per cent of the country’s combined capacity — Ultratech Cement seems a good value pick, given the recent correction in stock price.
The stock trades at 36 times the price earnings, which is at a discount to its three-year average of 46 times.
Majority of the costs incurred by cement makers are from fuel (energy), logistics and raw material consumption. Sanguine trends in these costs have boosted the company’s profitability. Its EBITDA per tonne stood at ₹1,590 in the latest June quarter, highest over a decade. These cost-savings are likely to sustain.
For instance, lower fuel consumption and fall in prices of pet coke and imported coal have resulted in savings in fuel costs. In FY19, there was an 18 per cent reduction in aggregate power consumption.
That aside, the international average pet coke and coal prices have also been falling steadily since December 2018. Analysts estimate that prices of pet coke and imported coal have dropped by 28 and 40 per cent respectively in August 2019 as well. The company has, through its acquisitions, optimised the average lead distance. This, coupled with lower diesel prices and revised axle load norms, have led to substantial savings in freight costs.
Ultratech Cement has been aggressively adding newer capacities since 2004, mainly through acquisitions. Five acquisitions in the last 15 years have added 52 mtpa capacity — a growth of 8 per cent CAGR to its global capacity (at 102.8 mtpa in FY19).
Notable ones being the acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates and Binani Cement’s assets in June 2017 and November 2018 respectively, adding 26.45 mtpa (in total) to Ultratech’s capacity. In July 2019, the company also received a NCLT nod to acquire the cement business of Century Textiles, which will further add 14.6 mtpa to its current capacity, taking Ultratech’s consolidated capacity to over 117 mtpa by 2QFY20.
The company’s inorganic moves have helped it garner better realisations and benefit from cost-savings through resource optimisation. Its ability to buy distressed assets at reasonable valuations has also helped it maintain its debt levels. In FY19, the net debt was 0.73 times its equity.
The effective tax rate for the company (standalone), comes to 21 per cent in FY19, which is lower than the new rate of 25.17 per cent announced recently, implying that the company may continue with its existing regime.
According to the annual report, there has been an increase in MAT credit entitlement for FY19 (about ₹197 crore), indicating that the company has paid tax under MAT provisions in FY19. The reduction in MAT rates to 17.47 per cent now, could lead to savings on tax outgo."
2,2019-10-21,UltraTech,"UltraTech Cement net up 63 per cent on lower cost, higher realisation 
UltraTech Cement, an Aditya Birla Group company, reported 63 per cent increase in September quarter consolidated net profit at Rs 579 crore against Rs 356 crore logged in the corresponding period last year on the back of lower cost and higher realisation.
Net sales were up four per cent at Rs 9,491 crore (Rs 9088 crore).
The company’s board plans to invest Rs 940 crore in increasing grinding capacities at its plants in Bihar and West Bengal by six lakh tonnes per annum each and putting up a new grinding unit of 2.2 million tonnes per annum in Odisha. These projects are expected to be completed between January and March 2021.
Overall expenses were flat at Rs 8,878 crore (Rs 8,868 crore) with lower power and fuel cost of Rs 1,966 crore (Rs 2,265 crore) and flattish freight expense of Rs 2,115 crore (Rs 2,281 crore).
The company has completed acquisition of the cement business of Century Textiles and Industries through a scheme of demerger with effective date of October 1.
Following this, UltraTech has allotted 1.39 crore equity shares to Century Textiles' shareholders as on October 14.
While clearing the company's proposal, NCLT has fixed May 20, 2018 as the applicable date for the acquisition. The company has consolidated Century's accounts with itself from May, 2018.
Overall capacity after the acquisition crossed 100 mtpa per annum to 109 mtpa and UltraTech has emerged world's third largest (excluding China) cement company.
Extended monsoon and heavy flooding across the country resulted in depressed demand. The situation was more aggravated in eastern and Central parts of India where Century Textiles has manufacturing units. These plants had undertaken annual shut downs impacting operation at these plants.
Annual maintenance undertaken during the quarter pushed up variable cost by three per cent.
The company has completed upgradation and integration of its subsidiary Nathdwara Cement after a major shut down during the quarter. This resulted in higher cost and lower capacity utilisation at the plant. UltraTech Nathdwara generated free cash outflow of Rs 100 crore in the first half of this fiscal. The company expects disposal of non-core assets to further improve its returns."
1,2019-10-22,UltraTech,"Ultratech Cement: Low volume growth, weak realisations play spoilsport with analysts’ projections 
 
Cement major Ultratech Cement reported Q2 numbers on Monday, with stellar bottomline growth of 72 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y). However, while the quarterly profit of Rs 639 crore was evidently high, it was much lower than analysts’ expectations, despite factoring in a seasonally weak quarter.
Reasons for the deviation could largely be attributed to lower-than-expected volume growth and weak realisations on account of monsoons. Ultratech also saw a 2 per cent y-o-y drop in grey cement volumes (standalone).
The company continued to witness cost benefits on all three fronts – raw material, energy and logistics costs on y-o-y basis. Energy costs – on per tonne basis – dropped 9 per cent y-o-y to Rs 1,003 per tonne, led by continuing fall in global pet coke prices.
Despite Ultratech’s logistics mix skewed in favour of roads, it was able to reap the benefit (marginally) of the waiver in peak season railway surcharge. This led to a 4 per cent savings in logistics cost per tonne.
Consequently, EBITDA per tonne saw a 31 per cent jump to Rs 1,122.5. This came in despite a 15 per cent increase in other costs (per tonne) due to lower sales volume impacting operating leverage.
While EBITDA per tonne jumped on y-o-y basis, there was a sequential drop of 29 per cent in EBITDA per tonne. Lower realisations and increase in fly ash prices over Q1FY20 impacted the operational performance.
The company had reported its highest EBITDA per tonne in Q1FY20, attributed predominantly to cost savings and healthy realisations witnessed across cement players.
While Q2 – on account of monsoons – is a seasonally weak quarter for cement manufacturers, analysts expected volume growth to be flat. However, thanks to the growing positive sentiment around the construction space, realisations were expected to remain higher as the demand outlook remained strong. Some analysts did expect realisations to have peaked in Q1FY20 and projected a 4-5 per cent sequential drop in cement prices in Q2. But Ultratech saw a steeper 16 per cent q-o-q drop in realisations in Q2FY20.
The management reiterated that the merger with Century Textiles will be effective from October 1, subsequent to transfer of mining leases. Post this, the domestic capacity of Ultratech stands at 109.4 MTPA. The acquisition – much like Ultratech’s earlier deals – brings in other added advantages. Apart from healthy limestone reserves, the company now adds another 5,000 dealers to its network, taking the total to more than 27,000 dealers.
With an additional Rs 3,000 crore of debt post acquisition, the net debt of the company stands at Rs 18,719 crore as at the end of the September quarter. This is however, 7 per cent lower than the March-end figure, thanks to the spike in cash flows on account of cut in MAT (tax) rates. As of March 2019, the company had unutilised MAT credit of Rs 1,400 crore. The corporate tax cut however, had minimal impact on the company’s bottomline.
All in all, while the benefits of the deal will be reaped in H2FY20, investors have seen a 5 per cent dilution in their stake from October (owing to shares issued to shareholders of Century Textiles). This would however, be offset by significant growth in earnings in the coming quarters, due to added capacities.
The company continues to ride on healthy demand outlook, thanks to the Centre’s increasing thrust on infrastructure and affordable housing. That apart, healthy monsoons could be a strong rural demand driver as well.
Hence, with added capacities and continuing positive demand outlook, realisations are expected to be better in H2FY20. Ultratech is likely to outshine other cement players with its leadership position and allied cost advantages.
