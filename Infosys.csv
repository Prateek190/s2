ITC seeks for a direction

ITC is stuck in a narrow range for the third consecutive week. The support at ₹260 and resistance at ₹267 are key levels to watch in the coming days. A breakout on either side of these two levels will decide the next leg of move for the stock and give a cue on the upcoming trend. If the stock sustains above ₹260 and breaks above ₹267 decisively, the downside pressure will ease. Such a break can take it higher to ₹272 and will also give an early indication that the downtrend that has been in place since July 2017 could be ending. A decisive break and close above ₹272 will confirm the trend reversal and can target ₹277 and ₹280 thereafter. But if ITC declines below ₹260, it can dip to test the significant support level of ₹257. A further fall below ₹257 will then increase the possibility of the stock extending its down-move towards ₹252. Traders can hold the long positions and accumulate on dips at ₹257. Retain the stop-loss at ₹254 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹270.

Infosys can dip ahead of results

After a strong rally for four consecutive weeks, Infosys fell sharply last week by 2.6 per cent. Support is at ₹1,010. A break below it will increase the likelihood of the stock extending its current down-move to ₹980 or ₹975 this week, well ahead of the third quarter results announcement on Friday. The outcome of the quarterly results will then determine the next trend for the stock. If Infosys manages to bounce from ₹980-₹975, an upmove to ₹1,010 will be possible. But a fall below ₹975 can drag the stock further lower to ₹950 levels. On the other hand, if the stock sustains above ₹1,010 this week, a bounce to ₹1,035 and ₹1,045 is possible again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹1,010 and ₹1,045 can be seen for some time. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹1,045 is now needed for the stock to gain fresh momentum and rally further. The next target above ₹1,045 is ₹1,070. Investors can hold the long positions and can accumulate if the stock falls towards ₹980 in the coming days.

RIL is stuck in a narrow range

RIL has been stuck in a narrow range over the last couple of weeks. The immediate outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹908 and resistance is at ₹937. A breakout on either side of ₹908 or ₹937 will determine the next trend. Until then the stock can continue to trade sideways between ₹908 and ₹937. A strong break above ₹937 can ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take the stock higher to the crucial resistance level of ₹960. A strong break above ₹960 can boost the momentum and take the stock further higher to ₹1,000 levels thereafter. On the other hand, if RIL declines below ₹937 in the coming days, a fall to ₹895 or ₹890 is possible. A break below ₹890 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹880 or ₹875. As being reiterated over the last few weeks, the region between ₹880 and ₹875 is a crucial support zone. A decisive break below ₹875 will increase the possibility of a double-top reversal pattern on the chart. In such a scenario, the possibility of the stock falling to ₹854 will increase.

Short-term view is bearish for SBI

SBI fell last week as expected to touch a low of ₹301.65. Though it managed to reverse higher from the week’s low, the bounce-back move lacks strength. The stock made a high of ₹311.8 on Friday and came off from there to close 1 per cent lower. The short-term outlook remains bearish. A cluster of resistances in the broad ₹310-₹320 region can cap the upside in the short term. An intermediate bounce to this resistance zone if seen can see fresh sellers coming into the market. A fall to ₹294 or ₹292 is likely in the coming days. A strong break below ₹292 will increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹285. Traders who have taken short positions last week can hold them. Add more short positions at ₹314 if an intermediate bounce breaking above ₹310 is seen in the near term. Retain the stop-loss at ₹317 for the target of ₹294. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹305 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹299. The outlook will turn positive only on a strong break above ₹320. But such a strong move looks less probable.

Uptrend is intact in Tata Steel

Tata Steel rose for the third consecutive week and was up over 5 per cent last week. The strong surge rally last week strengthens the overall uptrend. Support at ₹735 can limit the downside in the near term. Dips to this support may find fresh buyers coming into the market. The downside could be limited to the next significant support levels of ₹715 and ₹690 even if the stock declines, breaking below ₹735. But such a fall looks less likely. As such, the possibility of the stock sustaining above ₹735 is high . A rally to ₹800 is likely. A strong break above ₹800 will increase the likelihood of the up-move extending to ₹825 and ₹850 levels. An intermediate pull-back move from ₹850 levels to ₹800 or ₹750 cannot be ruled out. But the overall uptrend will continue to remain intact. Tata Steel is now all set to revisit ₹930 and ₹950 levels from a medium to long-term perspective. Investors can hold the long positions. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹640. Consider booking partial profits around ₹900 levels."

Former CEO Vishal Sikka earned USD 6.75 million in FY17 much to disliking of Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy. Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala is getting a bit over USD 2 million.
Shaw, who is part of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC), said Parekh will also receive Rs 3.25 crores in restricted stock units. “He will also get Rs 13 crores in annual performance equity grants,” she said.

291,2018-01-08,Infosys,"Salil Parekh to take charge as Infy CEO today
Salil Parekh, 53, will take over as the new CEO & MD of Infosys on Tuesday bringing to an end months of acrimony, wiff of scams and exit of the previous CEO and a few other directors on the company’s board.
Salil Parekh — who was a group executive board member with global consulting firm Capgemini — will formally join the $10-billion IT giant, Infosys on Tuesday. His appointment was announced by Infosys on December 2. Stakeholders including the shareholders will keenly watch the performance of Parekh whose main task will be to see that the company is able to shake off the controversies surrounding it and restore the confidence of its employees and investors.
Nandan Nilekani, Chairman of the Board in a statement last month, said that Parekh has a strong track record of executing business turnarounds and managing very successful acquisitions. “The board believes that he is the right person to lead Infosys at this transformative time in our industry.”
Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Chairperson of the Nomination & Remuneration Committee, said that Parekh was selected after a comprehensive global search effort and was the top choice from a pool of highly qualified candidates. The new CEO has a Master of Engineering degrees in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering from Cornell University, and a Bachelor of Technology degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
UB Pravin Rao will step down as the interim CEO and Managing Director effective January 2 and will continue as Chief Operating Officer and a whole-time Director of the company."
300,2018-01-09,Infosys,"SEBI issues show-cause notice to Infosys
Tech services giant Infosys has been issued a show-cause notice by SEBI seeking clarification on whether the company failed to follow proper process for related party transactions and disclosure norms under stock exchange listing agreement.
Sources close to the development told BusinessLine that it is following this show-cause notice that Infosys approached SEBI for a settlement under consent mechanism.
Infosys is under SEBI scanner for alleged lax in corporate governance practices and non-disclosure of key information to its shareholders. Among the aspects that SEBI is looking at includes sequence of events that led to the resignation of its former CEO Vishal Sikka followed by a major stock price crash on the back of huge built-up in derivative positions.
Non-disclosure of information with regard to severance pay to its former CFO Rajiv Bansal is also on the market regulator’s radar, the sources said.
Infosys agreed to pay ₹23.02 crore severance pay, salary and other benefits to Bansal in 2015 and while such an information was disclosed to the market regulator in US, it was not disclosed to exchanges in India. Around ₹5 crore was paid to Bansal but the rest was held back after objections were raised by Infosys co-promoter Nayarana Murthy.
Controversy first erupted after a whistle-blower letter to SEBI had highlighted that Bansal’s pay was ‘hush money’ being paid to him as he had reservations about Infosys acquisition of Panaya, an Israeli firm.
Murthy sought full details of the probe and wanted complete disclosure on the relationship between executives of Infosys and investors of Panaya. This issue first came up when an anonymous email was sent to SEBI and the US Securities and Exchange Commission alleging that the acquisition was overvalued and that there was a possibility of some Infosys executives benefiting from the deal. This year, Sikka resigned as Infosys CEO as the Panaya and Bansal controversy dragged.


The share price of Infosys crashed by 10 per cent in a single trading session in August this year just a day after Sikka resigned wiping out ₹22,500 crore in investor wealth. The shares fell another 5 per cent in the following session despite a buy back announcement. There were reports that a few foreign investors sold the shares ahead of Sikka’s resignation and also there was a built-up of huge short position in the counter. After Sikka’s resignation, SEBI chairman Ajay Tyagi had said that the regulator was tracking the price movement in Infosys shares closely.
“SEBI seems to have woken up a little late in the day to the happening in Infosys,” said Anil Singhvi, Chairman, Ican Investment Advisors. “The happenings at Infosys are an iconic case and delayed action has only hurt minority shareholders. Also, it is not understood as to why Infosys has a Brahminical treatment for regulators in the US and untouchable like treatment for shareholders in India when it comes to following disclosure norms.”
Infosys said it did not want to comment on email seeking its response to SEBI’s show casue notice.
In a filing to stock exchanges, Infosys last week said it has approached SEBI with an application to settle the issues under consent arising out of alleged disclosure lapses on the severance package paid to Bansal."

Accordingly, the trading window will be closed from December 16, 2017 and will re-open on January 15, 2018, the Bengaluru-based company added. However, the trading window restrictions shall not apply to shares tendered under the on-going buyback offer of the company, Infosys said.

286,2018-01-09,Infosys,"Infosys signs APA with US IRS; to get $225-million tax reversal
Infosys has concluded an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) deal with the US Internal Revenue Service.
In accordance with the APA, Infosys expects to reverse tax provisions of about $225 million made in previous years which are no longer required under International Financial Reporting Standards as well as Indian Accounting Standards.
Further, in line with the APA, the company expects to pay out approximately $233 million due to the difference between the taxes payable for prior periods as per the APA and the actual taxes paid for such periods, the company said.
The agreement covers financial years from 2011 to 2021, and the amount is expected to be paid over the next few quarters, said company executives. The reversal of the tax provisions of approximately $225 million will have a positive impact on the consolidated basic Earnings Per Share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, by approximately $0.10.
Further, on account of the APA methodology, Infosys expects its overall effective tax rate to be lower by about 100 basis points or 1 per cent for future periods covered under the APA. MD Ranganath, CFO, said the APA provides greater predictability of the company’s taxes and minimises uncertainties.
Preliminary discussions with the IRS on the APA were initiated by Infosys in 2015, according to company executives. The APA will enhance the predictability of the company’s tax obligations in respect of its US operations."

At about 2 pm, Infosys shares were trading 1.75 per cent or Rs 17.85 higher at Rs 1,039.90 on the NSE.

A golden cross happened last week on the chart when the stock's 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) crossed above its 200-day EMA, a bullish sign from a longer-term perspective. Some analysts have turned bullish on the stock in the last one month, with 'strong buy' recommendations rising by two to 11 and buy ratings by one to 11. The stock has 17 hold recommendations, seven sell and one strong sell.

294,2018-01-09,Infosys,"Infosys completes Rs 13,000 cr buyback
IT services major Infosys today said it has completed its Rs 13,000 crore buyback programme that saw participation from Sudha Gopalakrishnan, Rohan Murty and LIC among others. The buyback scheme - a first in the company’s over three decade history - commenced on November 30 and closed on December 14.
“(A total of) 11,30,43,478 equity shares were bought back under the Buyback at a price of Rs 1,150 per equity share. The total amount utilised in the Buyback is Rs 13,000 crore excluding transaction costs...” Infosys said in a regulatory filing.
The programme saw participation from Life Insurance Corporation of India, Singapore government, Sudha Gopalakrishnan (wife of co-founder S Gopalakrishnan) and Rohan Murty (son of co-founder NR Narayana Murthy’s son) among others.
The filing showed that of all the equity shares tendered in the buyback, 5.41 per cent were by LIC and 2.18 per cent by Singapore government. Similarly, 15 lakh shares of Sudha Gopalakrishnan and 13.92 lakh shares held by Murty were accepted under the buyback.
As of September this year, Sudha Gopalakrishnan held the largest share in individual capacity among promoters group members with 2.14 per cent shareholding. The founders and families — classified as promoters group — held 29.28 crore shares, or 12.75 per cent, in Infosys at the end of September 2017.
After the buyback, the promoter group now holds 12.90 per cent share, as per the filing. The buyback had been a long-standing demand by some of the founders and high-profile former executives, who have been pushing Infosys to return surplus capital to shareholders.
Share buybacks typically improve earnings per share and return surplus cash to shareholders, while supporting share price during period of sluggish market condition. Earlier this year, its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services completed a Rs 16,000-crore mega buyback offer. Other competitors like Cognizant, Wipro and Mindtree had also made similar announcements."

Infosys CEO and MD Salil Parekh
   -  PTI

Newly appointed Infosys Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Salil Parekh said on Friday he will stay connected with the founders so the company stays true to its vision and beliefs, and announced he will outline a new strategy in April.
A smooth relationship with the founders was one of the bones of contention with former Chief Executive Vishal Sikka, which subsequently resulted in him leaving the company.
When asked on how he will manage this equation, Parekh said he will be deeply connected with the founders.
“My hope and expectation would be to be connected with the founders, in the sense of the original people who started the company, and pay respect to them in that line,” he said.
He said Infosys is a phenomenal company started by people who had tremendous vision, and that they created something which will last a very long time.
“Everything I have seen in the company, reconfirms that.” Parekh views the ongoing digital disruption as something that would create new opportunities.
“With around 1,100 clients, the business is growing well, and there’s high cash flow. Coupled with renewed energy and attention, we have an opportunity to build a stronger Infosys,” he said.
Parekh said he is reviewing contracts with clients and looking to engage more with the people, ahead of the new strategy in April.
“The priority, at this minute, is to connect with people and clients.”
Parekh’s appointment came after several months of public spat between the founders and Sikka along with some board members, on issues of corporate governance and transparency.
All this subsequently resulted in Sikka quitting the company, followed by Nandan Nilekani, one of the co-founders, being brought in by foreign institutional investors to take over as Chairman, to steer Infosys, which had lost in excess of ₹25,000 crore in market capital after Sikka’s exit in August 2017.
The comapny’s shares have gained close to 15 per cent in the past three months, outperforming the BSE IT index, which has risen 12.5 per cent."
281,2018-01-14,Infosys,"Weekly trading guide: SBI, ITC, Infosys, RIL, Tata Steel
SBI (₹301.8) fell for the third consecutive week. The stock was down 1.4 per cent last week. The near-term outlook remains bearish. A fall below ₹300 towards ₹296 and ₹294 is likely in the coming days. If SBI manages to reverse higher from around ₹294, a relief rally to ₹300 is possible initially. A break above ₹300 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹305 or even ₹310 thereafter. But if SBI breaks decisively below ₹294, there is a strong likelihood of the downmove extending further to ₹285. The region around ₹285 is a key short-term support with the potential to halt the current downmove. A strong upward reversal from around ₹285 will increase the possibility of the stock rallying towards ₹300 or even higher thereafter. As such the price action around ₹285 will need a close watch to get a cue on the next leg of move. Traders can hold the short positions. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹310. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹303 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹299 for the target of ₹294.
ITC (₹267.5) surged over 4 per cent intra-week, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹267 and made a high of ₹273.8 last week. However, it fell back from the week’s high giving back most of the gains to close the week just 1.7 per cent higher. Immediate support is at ₹266. If ITC manages to reverse higher again from this support in the coming days, it can strengthen the bullish momentum and go to ₹272 and ₹273 levels again. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹273 will then pave the way for the next target of ₹280. Even if the stock breaks below ₹266 this week, the next significant supports between ₹264 and ₹263 and then at ₹260 can limit the downside. The outlook will turn bearish only if ITC declines decisively below ₹260, which looks less probable at the moment. Traders can hold the long positions with the revised stop-loss at ₹265 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹268 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹272. Short-term traders who do not hold any positions can initiate fresh long positions at current levels and also accumulate on dips at ₹264. Keep the stop-loss at ₹259 for the target of ₹280. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹270 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹274.
The prolonged wait is over. Infosys (₹1,078.4) finally cleared the key hurdle of ₹1,045 after struggling for over 14 months. The stock surged over 6 per cent last week to close on a strong note above ₹1,045. This gives an initial confirmation that the downtrend that was in place since June 2016 has reversed. Infosys is now all set to target ₹1,350 over the long-term. A near-term dip to ₹1,050-₹1,045 cannot be ruled out before the stock extends its upmove. Strong support is now available in the broad ₹1,045-₹1,000 region. Only a decisive fall below ₹1,000 will turn the outlook bearish. But such a break is unlikely as any intermediate dips in the stock will now attract fresh buyers. Next resistance is at ₹1,120 which is likely to be tested in the short-term. A strong break above ₹1,120 will then clear the way for the next target of ₹1,200 over the medium-term. Investors can hold the long positions. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go long on dips at ₹1,060 and accumulate at ₹1,050. Keep the stop-loss at ₹980 for the target of ₹1,180.
RIL (₹946.7) surged breaking above the key resistance level of ₹937 last week. The stock was up 2.6 per cent last week. The region between ₹937 and ₹935 will now serve as a strong support for the stock in the near-term. As long as the stock remains above this support zone, there is a strong likelihood of it rallying to test the crucial resistance level of ₹960 in the coming days. Whether it breaks above ₹960 or not will then determine the next move. A strong break above ₹960 will boost the momentum. Such a break will pave the way for RIL to target the psychological ₹1,000 mark going forward. It will also wipe out the threat of the double-top reversal pattern formation on the chart that we have been reiterating in this column over the last few weeks. But if the stock reverses lower from ₹960 it can fall to ₹940 or ₹935 again. The possibility of the stock extending its downmove towards ₹910 or even ₹900 cannot be ruled out. In such a scenario, RIL can remain in the ₹880-₹960 sideways range for some more time.
After a strong surge for three consecutive weeks, the rally in Tata Steel (₹771) paused last week. The stock was stuck in a narrow range between ₹760 and ₹780 last week. Resistance is around ₹785. As long as the stock remains below this hurdle, an intermediate dip to ₹745 or ₹740 cannot be ruled out. Further fall below ₹740 looks less probable at the moment. A range bound move with a bullish bias between ₹740 and ₹785 can be seen for some time in such a scenario. An eventual break and a decisive weekly close above ₹785 will boost the momentum. Such a break will take the stock higher to the next targets of ₹830 and ₹850. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹930 and ₹950 over the long-term. Investors can hold the long positions. Retain the stop-loss at ₹640 and revise it higher to ₹680 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹800. As mentioned last week, investors can consider booking partial profits around ₹900 levels. A trendline support at ₹710 and the 100-day moving average at ₹694 are the key supports for Tata Steel. The outlook will turn negative only if it declines below ₹694 decisively, which looks unlikely at the moment.

278,2018-01-16,Infosys,"Infosys rolls out knowledge-based solution
Infosys has launched its Infosys Business Assurance Store, a knowledge-based solution with a repository of one million software-related test assets across various industry domains, technologies, products and packages.
Further, this solution enables clients to enhance productivity in test planning, aids continuous testing and minimises dependency on subject matter experts, the company said in a statement.
Further, the Infosys Business Assurance Store integrates with third-party solutions such as HPE Application Lifecycle Management, Microsoft SharePoint, among others. The store helps clients drive greater operational efficiencies and accelerate business agility through improved test design. This solution uses machine-learning tools for traceability, knowledge clustering and optimisation.
Ravi Kumar S, President and Deputy Chief Operating Officer, Infosys, said: “Testing has taken a paradigm shift from being an end-of-lifecycle activity to managing user experience in the digital landscape. This solution is about expediting testing and utilising test cases, built through our years of experience in delivering agility to our customers’ businesses.”"
285,2018-01-16,Infosys,"Will Infosys declare strong numbers?
After TCS’ decent show, focus has shifted to Infosys, which will announce results for the quarter and nine-months ending December 2017, on Friday. Other prominent companies that will declare their results include 3i Infotech, Gail India, Karnataka Bank and Sintex Industries. Besides, Infomedia Press and Reliance Industrial Infrastructure will also announce their numbers. Expectations are high from Infosys, as the stock has been rising in recent times."
283,2018-01-16,Infosys,"At end of Q3, no light in sight @Infosys
Infosys reported a muted set of numbers for the December 2017 quarter. Sequential revenue growth was 0.8 per cent in constant currency terms. On year-on-year basis, it was 5.8 per cent.
There was though nothing great to write home about TCS’ numbers either, it fared only slightly better in overall revenue growth sequentially (1.3 per cent) and year-on-year (6.2 per cent)
Infosys kept its revenue guidance for 2017-18 unchanged at 5.5-6.5 per cent.
But it was only in the last quarter that the guidance was revised downwards from 6.5-8.5 per cent.
The company added 79 new clients, but there werew only a few additions in the large buckets of $100 million-plus (1 new client) and $50 million-plus (3 new clients).
The contribution from the top 25 accounts dipped further in the quarter to 35.3 per cent. This was 36 per cent in the September 2017 quarter and 36.3 per cent in the December 2016 quarter.
With Salil S Parekh having taken over as MD and CEO, market hopes that the uncertainty within Infosys ends, but one needs to still watch out on senior management attrition in the coming months.
Growth across verticals were weak.
The BFSI segment (that contributes over a third of revenue) reported a growth of mere 0.1 per cent in constant currency terms, sequentially. The manufacturing and hi-tech segment saw growth drop 0.1 per cent.
Among geographies, North America — the largest — grew just 0.7 per cent in constant currency terms.
Operating profit margin was 24.1 per cent down by 10 basis points from the previous quarter.
TCS had reported a 10 basis points improvement and its margins were 25.2 per cent.
It looks like all Indian IT bellwethers are going to face a tough time till the BFSI segment in the US revives.
The valuation gap between Infosys and TCS, which historically was 15 per cent, hit 24 per cent in the September quarter.
The gap narrowed little bit after the Infosys’ new CEO came in, but it is still at about 20 per cent.
But given that Infosys hasn’t given much comfort to investors in its December quarter numbers, the valuation gap may continue to exist.

279,2018-01-16,Infosys,"Broker’s Call: Infosys (Buy)

Reliance Securities

Infosys (Buy)
CMP: ₹1,122.9
Target: ₹1,240
Infosys’ dollar revenue rose by 1 per cent q-o-q in 3QFY18; a positive factor was growth in Insurance (+7.3 per cent q-o-q), Retail & CPG (+3.2 per cent), Transport & Logistics (+6 per cent) and Energy & Utilities (+6.5 per cent). The IT major reported a 10 bps q-o-q EBIT margin expansion, led by all-time high utilisation and operational efficiency. Management alluded to an improvement in IT spending environment in CY18, with IT budgets in the key BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) vertical likely to improve following rise in discretionary spend, while in Retail and CPG vertical, new opportunity conversions have been strong particularly in CPG.
A major positive factor was the impressive rise in clients across buckets from $1-100 million, which suggests steady improvement in revenue visibility. A new CEO at the helm, positive IT budget outlook, potential improvement in the US economy, share buyback and higher amount of cash return to shareholders provide cushion to the stock price, in our view.

INFOSYS-ACQ
   -  Reuters


INFOSYS-ACQ
   -  Reuters

Shares of information technology companies surged in the morning trade even as the broader market was trading with marginal gains.
The BSE Information Technology index was trading with gains of 1.2 per cent at 12,173.92. It touched a high of 12,272.23 points. The BSE TECk index also surged to a high of 6,820.44, registering a jump of 1.61 per cent. The index was quoted at 6,770.81, up 0.87 per cent at 12.25 pm local time.
Meanwhile, the 30-share benchmark index Sensex was trading higher by 145.62 points or 0.42 per cent at 34,916.67. Leading IT companies like Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra registered gains of as much as 3 per cent on the BSE.
Infosys surged 3.30 per cent to touch a 52-week high of Rs 1,160, registering a surge in its shares price for the eighth consecutive session. TCS also hit a new high of Rs 2,925.00. Similar was the case with HCL Technologies, which touched its 52-week high of Rs 962.70. Meanwhile, shares of Tech Mahindra touched a high of Rs 564, up 1.11 per cent over its previous closing price.

Morgan Stanley in a research note has said that the Indian IT services stocks are set for a turnaround in 2018 as recovery in spending is “imminent“. According to the global financial services major, a turnaround in IT spending could quickly turn around the sentiment on these stocks.
Though the sector faces risks from automation and a slower pace of market share gains from global vendors, a cyclical rally could be in the offing, it added."
280,2018-01-18,Infosys,"'IT services stocks set for a turnaround this year'
Shares of IT services firms such as Infosys Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd rose as much as 2.48 per cent to 4.52 per cent.
Morgan Stanley says it expects a turnaround for IT services stocks in 2018 following tepid revenue growth last year
North America is likely to pick up in mid-2018 as banking clients start to spend, while digital deals have started bulking up, which could improve revenue growth rates and visibility, Morgan Stanley says in a note.
Morgan Stanley has raised the ratings for Infosys, Tech Mahindra Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd to “overweight"" and price targets.
The Nifty IT index climbed as much as 3.09 per cent to highest since April 2015, with all stocks in the green. Infosys hit its highest since July 15, 2016, Wipro rose to levels not seen since March 25, 2015, and TCS gained to its highest ever."
276,2018-01-22,Infosys,"Infosys selected as tech partner by A S Watson Group
The second largest IT services firm Infosys today announced it has been chosen as a technology partner by the A S Watson Group to provide services in the areas of data science and artificial intelligence. The strategic partnership will accelerate the global health and beauty retailer’s digital transformation initiatives, the company said in a statement.
“Infosys has been appointed as an official technology partner by the A S Watson Group to provide technology services across data science and artificial intelligence,” it said. The collaboration is part of ASW’s technology partnership programme that aims to forge strategic partnerships in line with the company’s long-term goals.
Infosys’ offerings will speed-up ASW’s next-generation digital marketing platform, build robust artificial intelligence and machine learning frameworks for customer centric analytics, optimise operational efficiencies and improve scalability. “We recognise that our customers are changing rapidly and technology has become an ever more critical ingredient to deliver our purpose,” Malian Ngai, group chief operating officer of A S Watson said, adding that the partnership programme is aimed at transforming the short-term contractual relationship to a longer-term strategic one.
The appointment of the first batch of global tech partners reflects the group’s intent to accelerate digital transformation, Ngai added."
275,2018-01-27,Infosys,"Infosys, TCS join global tech reskilling drive for 1 million workers
Indian IT giants TCS and Infosys have joined a global drive for tech reskilling of one million workers in the first ever such IT industry initiative.
The initiative, whose founding partners also include Accenture, CA Technologies, Cisco, Cognizant, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Pegasystems, PwC, Salesforce and SAP, aims to bring competitive training content together on one platform to serve the greater good.
The initiative will be targeting 1 million people for training and resource opportunities on the World Economic Forum SkillSET portal by January 2021.
The IT Industry Skills Initiative was launched here by the World Economic Forum to meet the global skills gap challenge and address job displacement arising from automation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
The initiative was conceived by the Forum’s IT Governors community under the chairmanship of Chuck Robbins, Chairman and CEO, Cisco.
“We need responsive solutions and coordination from all parts of society — governments, citizens and private industry alike — to re-envision an educational system based on lifelong learning that can fully prepare workers for the jobs of the future,” said Klaus Schwab, founder and Executive Chairman, WEF. “This initiative is a clear example of industry leaders taking concerted, collective action to address a major social challenge at scale.”

Mismatch

According to a WEF report on workforce reskilling, one in four adults reported a mismatch between the skills they have and the skills they need for their current job. Therefore, enabling and empowering workers to transform and update their skills is a key concern for businesses and societies across the globe.
The coalition has created a free platform of online tools to streamline the process of reskilling adults. The initial iteration of the portal will be available in April 2018.
The coalition, which continues to add members, will be working over the next few months to develop tools and processes intended to address many of the barriers that prevent adults from reskilling or successfully completing trainings.
The initiative will initially target the US market, with plans to scale to other geographies and build industry and public-sector partnerships in 2018 and beyond. Under the chairmanship of Mike Gregoire, CEO, CA Technologies, the coalition will report on progress at the WEF Annual Meeting 2019.
Cognizant CEO Francisco D’Souza said, “The workplace issue of the 21st century is a worldwide shortage of qualified technology talent driven by a massive skills gap, which we must address together on a global scale. The pace of technological change has education systems struggling to keep up in delivering learning experiences that are relevant, immersive and readily available as workers seek to expand their skills.”
He also said the future of talent development depends on new models, ways of thinking and initiatives like this one that engage individuals as lifelong learners and provide them with opportunities for continuous reinvention.
Infosys CEO Salil Parikh said, “Our relevance in an increasingly digital future will depend on our ability to learn and evolve lifelong at the pace of technology. Democratising digital literacy is an essential first step to make technology a force for good that moves us all forward.”
TCS chief Rajesh Gopinathan said with the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, enterprises are leveraging the combined effect of emerging technologies to transform their businesses. “Employees will also have to transform their skills and adopt newer ways of working to participate in today’s opportunities that are as enormous as in any of the previous generations. It is important for enterprises to make investments in reskilling and upskilling employees and prepare them for digital-age careers,” he added."
301,2018-01-27,Infosys,"Infosys severance pay plea: 'It's a matter of legality for SEBI, not emotions'

Former Infosys Chief Financial Officer V Balakrishnan


Former Infosys Chief Financial Officer V Balakrishnan

Former Infosys Chief Financial Officer V Balakrishnan today said it was not a matter of whistleblower’s emotions, but of legality for Sebi to decide on denying company’s consent plea in connection with ex-CFO Rajiv Bansal’s severance payment case.
“The whistleblower has said whatever he wants to say as per his viewpoint.. These are legal issues decided based on merits and not individual’s emotions.. What Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as a regulator thinks and decides is all that matters,” Balakrishnan told PTI here.
Earlier this year, a whistleblower had written to the market regulator over alleged lapses in the Panaya deal and Bansal’s severance pay.
The letter had stated that the package was decided by the then CEO Vishal Sikka and then general counsel David Kennedy.
The whistle-blower had asked why Infosys was reluctant in disclosing answers surrounding the “hush money.” While it is a norm for companies to settle cases via the backdoor, it should not be allowed this time and Sebi should prosecute both the board and management, he said in the letter.
The whistleblower had argued that a settlement was similar to a “backdoor agreement,” and if Infosys is allowed to do so, then “no whistleblower in future will take the pain to expose any malpractices in the corporate sector.”
“The whistle-blower may strongly feel about the issues he had raised.. the regulator will follow the due legal process and decide,” Balakrishnan reiterated.
The letter has brought allegations of poor corporate governance to the fore again after Infosys filed an application for settlement.
This has spurred Balakrishnan and another former CFO T V Mohandas Pai to launch an attack against the company, whose board is now led by Co Founder Nandan Nilekani.
Balakrishnan has demanded the resignation of board members, Roopa Kudva and Ravi Venkatesan in the matter.
Yesterday, board member Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw had exchanged barbs with Pai on twitter, saying, “The matters were reinvestigated (a)n(d) no wrong doings were found by new Chairman.. Let’s bring this to a closure and move on.. It helps no one.”
Earlier this week, Infosys had submitted a settlement application to Sebi with regard to issues surrounding the severance package of Bansal.
The company had said it wanted to resolve allegations that the severance payment was decided without seeking prior consent from the audit committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.
Yesterday, Mohandas Pai had disapproved whistleblower’s demand asking Sebi to prosecute the IT giant’s management and the Board. He had also said Infosys’ move to settle with Sebi the alleged disclosure lapses involving a severance pact is “perfectly fine.”
Infosys had decided to pay Rs 17.38 crore as severance payment to the then CFO Bansal in 2015. However, it only paid Rs 5 crore to him, holding back Rs 12 crore."
296,2018-01-27,Infosys,"Infosys BPO is now Infosys BPM Limited

INFOSYS-ACQ
   -  Reuters

Infosys BPO, the Business Process Outsourcing subsidiary of IT major Infosys, today said the company has received the approval of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to change its name to Infosys BPM Limited.
The new name is effective immediately and will be implemented across the company’s services, the company said in a release.
The new name is a reflection of the paradigm shift in the nature of services that the company now offers through its holistic approach of end-to-end transformative BPM (Business Process Management), the company said.
“The change in the name signifies our vision of ’reimagining business processes’ across experience, effectiveness and efficiency,” Infosys BPM CEO and MD Anantha Radhakrishnan said.
“Through our integrated people + software approach we continue to co-create business value for our clients, leveraging Automation, Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Cloud,” he said."
298,2018-01-27,Infosys,"Infosys again
With a new CEO in Salil S Parekh and with co-founder Nandan Nilekani at the helm as chairman it appeared as if the $11-billion Infosys had finally put behind the controversies that had dogged it the last couple of years. Sadly, that seems to have been a false hope. Even before Parekh could assume office, the twin ghosts of the Panaya acquisition and the severance package of former CFO Rajiv Bansal have come back to haunt the company. The whistleblower who first brought the two issues into the open has called for the prosecution of the Infosys management and board after the company filed a consent plea with market regulator SEBI on the latter’s ongoing probe over the severance package. Another former CFO, V Balakrishnan, has called for the resignation of former co-chairman, Ravi Venkatesan, and Roopa Kudva from the board and called for its overhaul with positions to be filled with people of “high integrity and stature”. In short, it’s back to square one for the beleaguered company and its investors.
This is not how it should be. The new board had given a clean chit to the Panaya acquisition in October and Nilekani went on record to say that his review of the deal showed that the conclusions drawn by the independent investigators were correct. He also clarified that the company had made appropriate disclosures on the Bansal severance package at the end of the relevant quarter. Normally, this should have been the end of the matter. What’s resurrected the issue again is Infosys’ decision to file a consent plea with SEBI, following a show-cause notice issued by the latter.
A consent plea is a legitimate mechanism available under the securities laws of the country for an entity under regulatory probe to settle the issue without admission of guilt. Infosys’ application to SEBI says that it will “neither admit nor deny the finding of fact or conclusion of law”. The reasoning is clear: two independent investigations have found no wrongdoing and a reconstituted board has upheld the findings. Therefore, continuation of the regulatory probe will not only be a waste of time and resources for the company but also divert its focus from the business. From the company’s viewpoint this is a pragmatic move that will allow it to concentrate on the challenges in its business. It is singularly unfortunate, therefore, that the whistleblower has once again raked up the issue. By persisting with his approach, the whistleblower, however good his original intentions were, now runs the risk of being seen as someone with an agenda to oust certain members from the board. The regulator should go ahead and deal with Infosys’ consent plea on merit without being distracted by the fresh developments. Infosys, by virtue of being the second largest IT company in India, is systemically important and cannot be put through the wringer all over again, and without basis at that."
284,2018-01-27,Infosys,"Infosys returns to high growth in Q3, net profit zooms 38.3%

shareholders


shareholders

Infosys on Friday welcomed new CEO Salil Parekh with better-than-expected quarterly results, aided by a tax reversal from the US tax authorities and new client wins.
Infosys, which maintained its margins, said its third-quarter net profit grew 38.3 per cent at ₹5,129 crore on a year-on-year basis and 37.6 per cent on a sequential basis. Its revenues grew 3 per cent at ₹17,794 crore and 1.3 per cent on a sequential basis.
The net profit growth was largely due to a one-time windfall gain which Infosys claimed as a part of a reversal of the tax provisions of about $225 million in an Advance Pricing Agreement deal with the US Internal Revenue Service. This had a positive impact on the consolidated basic Earnings Per Share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, by approximately $0.10.
Parekh, who took charge on January 2, said he would unveil an updated strategy in April. He said he would strive to build a stronger Infosys at a time when software exporters face technology shifts and changing businesses.
Nandan Nilekani, Chairman of the Board, said the company has “stabilised” and everything is “settled”, evidently referring to the spat between co-founders and former CEO Vishal Sikka. He said he would stay as long as it was needed and “not a day longer”.
According to Sanjoy Sen, Doctoral Research Scholar, Aston Business School, the timing of the tax reversal has been immensely fortuitous and made a significant difference between what would have otherwise been viewed as a mildly positive performance, as against a reasonably good performance with the ability to swing market sentiment in its favour.
Infosys reported dollar revenue growth at 1 per cent and constant currency revenue at 0.8 per cent QoQ and maintained its annual growth guidance at 5.5-6.5 per cent on a constant currency basis and 2.1-3.1 per cent in rupee terms.
The board re-designated Pravin Rao as the Chief Operating Officer and Whole Time Director, but the company also saw the exit of Rajesh Murthy, who quit after 25 years with the company.
For the first time in years, Infosys generated $593 million in free cash flow. CFO MD Ranganath said EBIT margin improved to 24.3 per cent. According to Emkay Research, retaining guidance on both revenue growth and operating margins are positive. Infosys shares closed marginally at ₹1,078, up or 0.26 per cent.
While Parekh has had an initial look at the growth strategy of Infosys, with a focus on IT consulting and wrapping digital services around it, he said that there is still some work to do. Analysts agree.
“Many Indian companies are locked in their traditional business and need to speed up the process of creative disruption. Only then can they manage changes,” said DD Mishra, Research Director, Gartner."

 Tech Mahindra has won the HYSEA’s best company award for its corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts in the fields of environment sustainability and education. Infosys has been adjudged the best company for its efforts in the area of education.
The Hyderabad Software Enterprises’ Association (HYSEA) has instituted the annual CSR awards to identify and recognise efforts of corporates in a variety of CSR activities. 
Wells Fargo India Solutions and ADP too got awards for their educational initiatives, while Sumtotal Systems India and CA Technologies and Synchrony Financial got special jury recognition awards at the HYSEA’s third annual CSR Summit held on Tuesday.

“It is extremely important for all of us to understand that it is our duty to pay back to the community and a compulsion because we want to live in a better country, hence we must look beyond fake data and understand that GDP alone cannot be a sign of progress in our country,” Anshu Gupta, Founder Goonj and Ramon Magsaysay Award winner, said."
273,2018-02-15,Infosys,"Investors pitch for another Infosys buyback

Around 11.3 crore shares were bought back and after the process, Infosys still has ₹29,000 crore in its books
   -  THE HINDU


Around 11.3 crore shares were bought back and after the process, Infosys still has ₹29,000 crore in its books
   -  THE HINDU

  Investors have urged Infosys to use its cash hoard and go in for a buyback for two more years in order to give value to shareholders. 
Last year, Infosys completed a ₹13,000-crore buyback programme, the first in its 36-year history. Around 11.3 crore shares were bought back, and among those who tendered their shares were Sudha Gopalakrishnan, Rohan Murty and some financial institutions such as LIC. 
After the completion of the buyback, promoters hold 12.9 per cent in the company, marginally up from earlier.
Growth pangs
But Infosys still has ₹29,000 crore on its books, and it is this that has investors urging the management to consider another buyback, at a time when the company and its peers are finding it difficult to grow. 
For example, while announcing the third-quarter results for 2018 fiscal, Infosys said it expects to clock revenue growth of about 5.5-6.5 per cent, down from 6.5-8.5 per cent it had projected at the beginning of the fiscal.
“Infosys should continue to buy back 4 per cent of its equity next fiscal too,” said Madhu Babu, IT analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher. 
Others in the industry such as former Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan too feel that with growth rates maturing in the industry, capital allocation becomes key to shareholder value. 
“One-off buybacks don’t create shareholder value and it needs to be done consistently,” he said.
To be fair, Infosys has made some changes to its corporate policies, which include giving back up to 70 per cent of its free cash flow back to investors in the form of dividends. 
According to company officials, Infosys generates about ₹12,000 crore in free cash flow. 
“A share buyback would be a good option to enhance shareholder value and should be used instead of a dividend payout,” said Urmil Shah, IT analyst, IDBI Capital. Other tech outsourcing majors such as Accenture and IBM too are taking the buyback route. For instance, IBM has reduced its outstanding shares by 19 per cent from 2011 to 17 through buybacks. In 2011, IBM had $16.6 billion in cash flows; in 2017, that had come down to $2.5 billion. Accenture has done similarly.
Interestingly, Infosys could follow the trend of cross-town rival, Wipro, which has done two consecutive buybacks (this fiscal and the last one) to reward investors at a time when it faces growth pressures. In the quarter to December 2017, Wipro concluded the second buyback of 343.75 million equity shares. This resulted in a total cash outflow of ₹11,000 crore. 
Some analysts believe that things will get clearer for Infosys at the beginning of next fiscal, when the company issues its annual revenue guidance. If earnings in financial year 2018-19 continue to be muted, Infosys will be under pressure to declare a second consecutive buyback, said an analyst from a Mumbai-based brokerage house. 
He, however, pointed out out that he expects the growth to improve in the next fiscal."

271,2018-02-22,Infosys,"Infosys files counter-suit for ₹100 cr against former CFO 

Rajiv Bansal
   -  BL


Rajiv Bansal
   -  BL

Two-and-a-half months after Infosys submitted an application to SEBI to resolve its former CFO Rajiv Bansal’s severance pay issue, the software major has filed a counter-suit for ₹100 crore, alleging that he did not fulfil his obligations and breached trust.
While an Infosys spokesperson said: “We have no comments to offer,” industry watchers BusinessLine spoke to felt that this counter-suit could be an exercise to either delay the settlement or settle it out-of-court.
The issue pertains to the severance pay, of ₹17.38 crore, Rajiv Bansal was eligible for after he stepped down in December 2015.
While Infosys paid ₹5 crore, it held back the remaining amount after Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy termed the compensation “excessive” and alleged that the management had paid Bansal “hush money”.
Infosys then said the agreement with Bansal provided for non-compete obligations, as also other rights and obligations. “Certain payments to Rajiv under the agreement have been suspended pending certain clarifications with regard to such rights and obligations,” it had said in a statement.
The Infosys board and its then CEO, Vishal Sikka, admitted that there was an element of subjectivity involving the quantum of the severance pay to Bansal but said that since then, it has made changes to the company policies to ensure that such a thing doesn’t happen again.
The issue reared its head again after Sikka quit the company, in August 2017. In December, Infosys filed for a “settlement application” with SEBI, to neither admit nor deny the findings of any probe.
A “settlement application” is a process by which companies settle matters.
This “settlement application” was in response to a whistleblower writing an e-mail to SEBI, pointing out that the company had flouted corporate governance norms. The complaint alleged thati Infosys had not sought prior and separate approval of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, or ofi the audit committee regarding stopping of payments and initiating arbitration under the severance agreement.
Riled over the stick payments, Bansal moved the court against Infosys, demanding that his remaining dues be paid.
This latest round of counter-suit from Infosys, according to industry watchers, is a tactic used to delay the settlement process. “If the plea was filed with SEBI, why has the company taken so long to file a a counter-suit,” said a corporate lawyer who spoke on conditions of anonymity."
270,2018-03-04,Infosys,"Five of top-10 companies lose Rs 26,641 cr in m-cap, SBI takes biggest hit 
 Five of the 10 most valued Indian companies saw a combined erosion of Rs 26,641.48 crore in market valuation last week, with the country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) taking the steepest hit. The other firms which witnessed a decline in their market capitalisation (m-cap) for the week ended Thursday were TCS, ITC, ONGC and HDFC Bank. On the other hand, RIL, Maruti Suzuki, HDFC, Infosys and HUL finished the week with gains. 
The m-cap of SBI dived by Rs 11,696.44 crore to Rs 2,26,634.57 crore. The valuation of TCS plunged Rs 7,618.87 crore to Rs 5,81,388.28 crore and that of ITC tanked Rs 6,535.69 crore to Rs 3,21,521.62 crore. ONGC’s m-cap dropped to Rs 2,43,253.97 crore, a decline of Rs 577.50 crore, while HDFC Bank saw its valuation dip by Rs 212.98 crore to Rs 4,87,043.44 crore.
 In contrast, the m-cap of RIL surged by Rs 8,677.76 crore to Rs 6,00,285.50 crore. The valuation of Maruti Suzuki India soared by Rs 5,159.53 crore to Rs 2,68,129.28 crore and that of HDFC jumped by Rs 3,819.56 crore to Rs 2,99,923.16 crore. The m-cap of Infosys increased by Rs 1,004.69 crore to Rs 2,53,411.72 crore, while that of HUL spurted by Rs 573.59 crore to Rs 2,86,934.10 crore. 
In the ranking of top-10 firms, RIL stood at the numero uno position, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, ITC, HDFC, HUL, Maruti Suzuki India, Infosys, ONGC and SBI. Over the last week, the flagship Sensex recorded a fall of 95.21 points or 0.27 per cent."
269,2018-03-08,Infosys,"Not named by CBI in income-tax refund fraud case, clarifies Infosys
Infosys today clarified that the CBI has not named it as an accused party in the alleged fraud concerning the Income Tax department.
So far we have not been contacted by the CBI in connection with this matter. Infosys will co-operate with law enforcement agencies as and when we are approached. 
As per our obligations under the SEBI Listing Regulations and the Company’s Disclosure Policy, Infosys will make appropriate disclosures, the company said in a statement to the exchanges.
According to reports, some Income Tax officials, a Chartered Accountant and some Infosys staff filed tax using forged documents and claimed fake tax refunds from employees of companies, which include IBM, Vodafone, SAP Labs India, Biocon, Cisco and ICICI Bank. “The processing of e-returns is outsourced to Infosys Technologies Ltd, who validate the returns in bulk and generate list of cases where refunds have to be approved. The Assessing Officers of the I-T department posted in processing centre give the approval for release of refunds to assessees through their bank accounts,” according to reports.
The CA, a department statement said, was “found to be instrumental in filing false income-tax returns and making fraudulent refund claims” by citing inflated or false claims of loss from house property.
Subsequently, CBI conducted searches on the premises of an unidentified CA and claimed to have “seized” bogus claim documents of his various clients along with WhatsApp chat messages."
302,2018-03-09,Infosys,"Weekly Trading Guide
After falling for two consecutive weeks, SBI closed on a flat note last week. The stock was stuck in a narrow range between ₹309 and ₹321 in the past week. The immediate outlook is not clear. A breakout on either side of ₹309 or ₹321 will decide the next move. A strong break above ₹321 will ease the downside pressure and can take the stock higher to ₹327 — the 21-day moving average resistance initially. Further break above ₹327 level will increase the likelihood of the stock’s up move extending to ₹335 or even to ₹340 thereafter. On the other hand, if SBI breaks and closes decisively below ₹309, it will come under selling pressure. In such a scenario, the possibility of the stock falling to ₹300 or ₹297 on the back of profit booking will be high. Further break below ₹297 can drag the stock to ₹290 thereafter. Traders can hold the short positions taken at ₹315. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹322 for the target of ₹292. Move the stop-loss lower to ₹305 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹299.
ITC fell as expected in the past week breaking below the support at ₹253.5. However, this down move did not sustain. The stock reversed sharply recovering all the losses from its low of ₹250.5 on Thursday and close 2.5 per cent higher. The short positions recommended last week has been stopped out during this sudden reversal. The strong upward reversal last week has taken the stock well above the 21-day moving average resistance, which was capping the upside since November. Also, the strong bounce last week is technically significant as it has happened from a key long-term trend-line support level of ₹249. Immediate resistance is at ₹264, which is likely to be tested in the coming days. If ITC manages to surpass this hurdle, the downside pressure will ease. A rise to test ₹269 or ₹271 — the key 21-week moving average resistance is possible. But if the stock reverses lower from ₹264, it can fall to ₹260 or ₹257. Such a pull-back move will keep the stock in range bound between ₹250 and ₹264 for a while.
Contrary to expectation, Infosys surged 4.5 per cent last week. The 55-day moving average, which is about to cross 100-day moving average suggests that the downside could be limited and leaves near-term view positive. The current upmove can extend to ₹1,020. A break above ₹1,020 can take it to ₹1,030 and ₹1,035. The region between ₹1,030 and ₹1,035 is a crucial resistance. A strong weekly close above ₹1,035 will signal the reversal of the long-term downtrend that has been in place since June 2016. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹1,200 or ₹1,300 over the long term. But if Infosys reverses lower from ₹1,020 or from the ₹1,030-₹1,035 region, it can fall to ₹1,000 or ₹975. In such a scenario, the prolonged sideways range between ₹900 and ₹1,035 that has been in place since November 2016 will remain intact. So, a subsequent fall below ₹975 will then increase the possibility of the stock falling to ₹950 or ₹900. Investors can hold long positions.
RIL reversed higher in the past week after making a low of ₹895.9 on Tuesday. The stock closed 1.2 per cent higher for the week. The weekly candlestick reflects indecisiveness in the market. Resistance is at ₹937 and support is at ₹918 — the 21-day moving average. A breakout on either side of these levels will decide the next move. If RIL declines below ₹918, it can fall to ₹905. Further break below ₹905 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹893 or ₹882. As mentioned last week, a fall to ₹882 will form a double-top reversal pattern on the chart. A decisive break below ₹882 will confirm the pattern and increase the possibility of the stock falling to ₹845. Further break below ₹845 can drag it to ₹830 or even to ₹800. On the other hand, if RIL manages to break above ₹937 in the coming days, the downside pressure will ease. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹959 and ₹961. The region between ₹959 and ₹961 is a crucial resistance, which has to be broken to target ₹1,000.
Tata Steel tumbled about 3 per cent in the initial part of the week and made a low of ₹660.6. However, the stock managed to reverse sharply from this low and close 2.4 per cent higher for the week. Support is at ₹684, which is likely to limit the downside in the near term. A rise to test the resistance at ₹715 is likely in the coming days. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹715 will boost the momentum. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹740 in the short term. On the other hand, if Tata Steel reverses lower from ₹715, it can fall to ₹690 or ₹684 again. Such a pull-back move will increase the likelihood of the stock breaking below ₹684 and revisit ₹670 and ₹660 levels. If the stock breaks below ₹660, the down move can extend to ₹650. The 21-week moving average at ₹660 and a trend-line support at ₹650 are the key supports for the stock. A sharp fall breaking below ₹650 is less likely. Fresh buying interest may emerge in the ₹660-₹650 region.

SBI (₹319.8)
SBI began the week on a volatile note and swung between ₹301 and ₹323 on the first trading day of the week. But that was short-lived and the stock stayed in a narrow range for the rest of the week. As long as it sustains above ₹315, the bias will remain positive for the stock to break above the immediate resistance at ₹325. Such a break will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹335 initially. Further break above ₹335 will increase the likelihood of the upmove extending to ₹347 or ₹350 thereafter. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go long and accumulate on dips at ₹315. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹304 for the target of ₹345. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹323 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹330. Cluster of supports are poised in between ₹315 and ₹310. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if SBI declines below ₹310 decisively. Such a break can push the stock lower towards ₹306 initially. A strong break below ₹306 will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling to ₹295 or even ₹290 thereafter.
ITC (₹263.3)
The stock of ITC fell over 2 per cent initially in the past week. However, it managed to reverse higher from the low of ₹259 and recoup almost all the loss. Immediate resistances are placed at ₹266 and ₹268 levels. Supports are at ₹261 and ₹260. ITC can remain range-bound in the band between ₹260 and ₹268 for some time. On the charts, the bias is bullish for the stock to break the range above ₹268 in the coming days. Such a break can boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹271 or ₹272 initially. Further break above ₹272 will then increase the likelihood of the stock’s rally extending to ₹277 in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if ITC declines below ₹260 in the coming days, it can fall to ₹257 or ₹256 initially. A strong break below ₹256 may increase the likelihood of the stock falling to ₹252 or ₹250 thereafter. Short-term traders with a high risk appetite can buy the stock on dips at ₹261 and accumulate at ₹258. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹254 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹270 levels.
Infosys (₹1,038.4)
The stock extended its upmove for the third consecutive week and has closed on a strong note — above the crucial resistance level of ₹1,035, thereby giving an initial sign that the downtrend that has been in place since June 2016 has ended. Immediate support is between ₹1,035 and ₹1,030. As long as the stock sustains above ₹1,030, there is a strong likelihood of it rallying to ₹1,050 and ₹1,070 in the coming days. Such a rally will confirm the trend reversal. Inability to break above ₹1,070 may trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹1,030. In such a scenario, fresh buyers may emerge at lower levels and limit the downside. An eventual break above ₹1,070 will pave way for ₹1,100 and even higher levels. It will also gear up the stock to target ₹1,350 levels over the long-term. The near-term view will turn negative only if Infosys declines below ₹1,000. In such a scenario, the stock can fall to ₹980 or ₹975 on the back of profit booking. But such a fall below ₹1,000 looks less likely at the moment. Investors can hold the long positions.
RIL (₹918.5)
The stock of Reliance Industries (RIL) spiked lower to make a low of ₹861.7 on last Monday. Though it bounced back immediately, it did not gain momentum to breach the 21-day moving average resistance at ₹923. RIL has to break above this 21-day moving average resistance decisively for the downside pressure to ease and also to gain strength to move higher. Such a break will pave the way for a fresh rally to ₹950 and ₹960. But if RIL stays under ₹923, it can continue to remain under pressure. A dip to test a key support at ₹900 is possible then. A break below ₹900 can take it lower to ₹880 — a crucial short-term support level. If the stock manages to reverse higher from there, it can test ₹900 and even higher levels thereafter. In such a scenario, a range bound move between ₹880 and ₹960 can be seen for some time. But if RIL declines below ₹880 decisively, it can fall to ₹845 levels. As mentioned last week, a sharp fall to ₹845 will confirm a double-top reversal pattern on the chart and will leave the stock in a danger of tumbling to ₹800 or even lower.
Tata Steel (₹710.6)
Tata Steel fell sharply to make a low of ₹675 initially in the past week. However, it reversed sharply higher thereafter to recover all the loss and close 2.3 per cent higher for the week. The stock has been getting strong support from the 21-week moving average over the last three weeks. The price action on the chart keeps the bias bullish for the stock. Key resistance is at ₹715, which is likely to be broken in the coming days. Such a break can boost the momentum and take it higher to ₹740 and ₹750, which are the next key resistances. Inability to break above ₹750 can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹720 or ₹715. However, an eventual break above ₹750 will then pave way for the long-term targets of ₹850 and ₹900. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions. Retain the stop-loss at ₹585. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if the stock declines below the support at ₹670. In such a scenario, the stock can fall to ₹660 and ₹650. But such a break and fall below ₹670 looks less probable at the moment.

SBI fell over 3 per cent last week. The fall has dragged the stock well below the key support level of ₹315. A cluster of resistances in between ₹315 and ₹320 can cap the upside in the coming days. The price action last week has turned the short-term outlook bearish. Also, a complex head and shoulder reversal pattern on the daily chart increases the likelihood of the stock falling in the coming days. Traders holding long positions can book loss and exit at current levels. The stock can fall to ₹300 initially. A break below ₹300 can drag it further lower to ₹296 and ₹293 or even ₹290 thereafter. Traders with high risk appetite can go short at current levels and on rallies at ₹314. Keep the stop-loss at ₹317 for the target of ₹294.
Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹306 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹301. The downside pressure will ease only if the stock breaks above ₹315 decisively. Such a break can take it to ₹320 initially. However, the stock has to breach ₹320 for the outlook to turn positive.
ITC was stuck in a narrow range over the last few weeks. The stock has been in between the 21-day moving average support at ₹260 and the 100-day moving average resistance at ₹267 over the last three weeks. A breakout on either side of ₹260 or ₹267 will determine the next trend.
If ITC manages to surpass ₹267 decisively, it can move up to ₹272 initially. It will also be an initial sign that the downtrend that has been in place since July 2017 is being reversed. A further rally breaking above ₹272 can then target ₹277 or ₹280, confirming the trend reversal. On the other hand, if ITC remains below ₹267 and breaks below ₹260, it can fall to ₹257 — a key short-term support level. A strong break below ₹257 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹252 thereafter. Traders who have taken long positions on dips last week at ₹261 can hold it. Accumulate longs at ₹258. Retain the stop-loss at ₹254 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹270.
Infosys had a volatile 2017. At one point of time the stock had tumbled about 15 per cent. But it recovered all the losses and has gained 3 per cent in 2017. . This recovery rally, which has taken the stock above the crucial ₹1,030-₹1,035 resistance zone, is signalling a trend reversal and the worst seems to be over. Immediate support is in between ₹1,035 and ₹1,030 and then the next significant support is around ₹1,000. As long as the stock remains above ₹1,000, the outlook is positive. A rally to ₹1,070 is likely in the short term, which will confirm the trend reversal. It will pave the way for the stock to target ₹1,350 levels. Inability to break above ₹1,070 initially can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹1,050 and ₹1,035.
Investors can hold the long positions and accumulate on dips at ₹1,015. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if the stock declines below ₹1,000. Subsequent targets are ₹980 and ₹965. But such a fall below ₹1,000 is less likely as dips to ₹1,000 may find fresh buyers coming into the market.
RIL, which has surged a whopping 71 per cent in 2017, witnessed muted trading in the final week of the year. The stock managed to sustain above ₹900, but remained in a narrow range all through the week. Support is at ₹912 and immediate resistance is at ₹935. A breakout on either side of these levels will give a cue on the next trend. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹935 can take RIL higher to ₹960 — a crucial resistance that has been capping the upside since October. Inability to break above ₹960 can pull the stock lower to ₹935 or even further down. But a strong break above ₹960 can target the psychological ₹1,000 level.
On the other hand, if RIL breaks below ₹912 in the coming days, it can fall to ₹896 initially. A further break below ₹896 can drag it to ₹880 — a crucial short-term support level. As reiterated over the last couple of weeks, a strong break below ₹880 will indicate a double top pattern on the chart and can drag the stock to ₹854 or even lower thereafter.
Year 2017 was a robust one for Tata Steel. The stock surged a whopping 87 per cent last year. The strong 3 per cent rally last week has taken the stock well above a key resistance level of ₹715, which has been capping the upside over the last several weeks. This marks the end of the sideways consolidation and also the resumption of the overall uptrend. Resistance is at ₹743, which was tested last week.
A strong break and a decisive weekly close above this hurdle is needed for the stock to extend its rally. Such a break will boost the momentum for the stock to target ₹850 over the medium term. But if Tata Steel continues to remain below ₹743, it can dip to ₹715 or ₹710 in the coming days. An immediate break below ₹710 is unlikely at the moment. So, as long as the stock remains below ₹743, a range-bound move between ₹710 and ₹743 can be seen for some time. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions. Accumulate on dips at ₹720. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹615.

Infosys to test a key resistance

The upmove in Infosys is gaining momentum. The stock rose for the second consecutive week and closed 2.2 per cent higher in the past week. Immediate support is at ₹1,016. As long as the stock stays above this support, a rise to test the crucial resistance region of ₹1,030-₹1,035 is likely in the coming days. Whether Infosys breaks above ₹1,035 will be key in determining the next move.
Inability to break above ₹1,035 and a subsequent pull-back move can take the stock lower to ₹1,015, ₹1,000 or even ₹990 thereafter. In such a scenario, the broad ₹900-₹1,035 sideways range may remain intact. But if the stock breaks and closes decisively above ₹1,035, it will be the first sign indicating that the downtrend that has been in place since June 2016 has ended. The stock can then test ₹1,050 initially. A break above ₹1,050 can take it higher to ₹1,070. A fresh rally to ₹1,070 will confirm the trend reversal. In that case Infosys will all be set to target ₹1,200 and ₹1,250 levels again over the medium term. Investors can hold the long positions.

Near-term outlook is positive for ITC

ITC failed to sustain higher after opening the week with a gap-up and making a high of ₹267.4 last Monday. Though the stock reversed downwards to touch a low of ₹257.6 on Wednesday, it managed to claw back and close 1.2 per cent higher for the week. The 21-day moving average support at ₹258 halted the fall last week. The near-term outlook is positive. Immediate resistance at ₹269 – the 100-day moving average – is likely to be tested in the near term. A strong break and a decisive close above this hurdle can take ITC higher to ₹272 and ₹276 thereafter. Such an upmove will also give an initial sign that the downtrend that has been in place since July has ended. A decisive weekly close above ₹276 will confirm the same. On the other hand, if the stock fails to break above ₹269 in the coming days and reverses lower, it can fall to ₹264 initially. Further break below ₹264 will increase the likelihood of the pull-back move extending to ₹261 thereafter. The region between ₹261 and ₹259 is a key support zone which is likely to limit the downside.

Immediate outlook is unclear for RIL

RIL was stuck in a narrow range between ₹908 and ₹933 in the past week. The stock has been moving in a sideways range since the beginning of the month and is seeking direction. This leaves the immediate outlook unclear. Support is at ₹900 and resistance is at ₹940. A breakout on either side of these levels will decide the next movement leg for the stock. If it sustains above ₹900 and breaches ₹940 in the coming days, an upmove to ₹960 is possible. But if RIL breaks below ₹900 in the coming days, it can fall to ₹885 or ₹878 initially.
The level of ₹878 is a crucial short-term support. If RIL manages to bounce from there, a bounce-back move to ₹900 or ₹930 is possible thereafter. But if the stock breaks decisively below ₹878, it can come under more selling pressure. It will then increase the likelihood of the stock falling to ₹860 or even ₹845 thereafter.
Such a fall will confirm a double-top reversal pattern on the charts and will leave the stock in danger of tumbling to ₹800, or even lower, thereafter.

SBI is stuck in a sideways range

SBI was stuck inside a sideways range between ₹309 and ₹321 for the second consecutive week. The immediate outlook continues to remain unclear and there is no change in our view from last week. A breakout on either side of ₹309 or ₹321 will decide the next trend. If the stock manages to sustain above ₹309 and gains momentum to breach ₹321, the downside pressure can ease. Such a break can take it to ₹323 — the 21-day moving average resistance or ₹325 initially. Further break above ₹325 will increase the likelihood of the upmove extending to ₹335 or even ₹340 thereafter.
On the other hand, if SBI declines decisively below ₹309, it will come under more selling pressure. In such a scenario, there is a strong likelihood of the stock falling to ₹300 or ₹297 on the back of profit booking. Further break below ₹297 can drag the stock to ₹290 thereafter. Traders can hold the short positions taken at ₹315. Retain the stop-loss at ₹322 for the target of ₹292. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹310 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹305.
Tata Steel can resume its uptrend
Tata Steel fell initially in the past week. However, the stock managed to bounce back after making a low of ₹671 on Thursday and recovering most of the loss made during the week. The price action since November reflects a flag formation on the charts. This is a bullish continuation pattern. It indicates that the current uptrend is still intact and is likely to resume in the coming weeks. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹715 will confirm the pattern. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to test the crucial ₹740-₹750 resistance region. An eventual break above ₹750 will pave the way for the next targets of ₹850 and ₹900 over the long term. Investors with a medium-term perspective can go long at current levels. Accumulate longs on dips at ₹685 and ₹670. Keep the stop-loss at ₹585. The 21-week moving average at ₹667 and a trendline around ₹645 are key supports for the stock. The outlook will turn negative only if the stock declines below these supports, which looks less probable at the moment.

SBI (₹253.1)
 As expected, SBI fell breaking below the 200-week moving average (₹260) support last week. The stock tumbled to a low of ₹244.4, but managed to recover some of the loss before closing 3.6 per cent lower for the week. The crucial support at ₹245 is holding well as of now. Since the stock has been falling continuously over the last few weeks, as long as it sustains above ₹245, a corrective rally in the short term cannot be ruled out. A strong break above the immediate resistance in the ₹258-₹260 zone can trigger this corrective rally, targeting ₹270 in the short term on the back of profit booking. But if SBI fails to breach ₹260 and remains below it, a revisit of ₹245 is possible. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹245 and ₹260 can be seen for some time. The stock will come under renewed pressure if it breaks below ₹245 decisively. Such a break can take it to ₹238 initially. Further break below ₹238 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹205 or ₹200 over the medium term.
 




 
 
ITC (₹259.4)
ITC fell breaking below the key support level of ₹262 last week. Though the stock has bounced from its intra-week low of ₹253.4, the muted price action of this recovery move indicates lack of strength. Strong resistance is in the ₹263-₹266 region. ITC should surpass ₹266 decisively to ease the downside pressure. In such a scenario, the stock can rally to ₹270 and ₹275 again. But the indicators on the chart suggest a lower possibility of the stock breaking above the ₹263-₹266 resistance zone. Immediate support is at ₹257. A strong break below it can drag the stock lower to ₹250 in the coming days. A break below ₹250 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending towards ₹244. Further fall below ₹244 looks less probable at the moment. Short-term traders can go short on rallies at ₹262 and ₹265 with a stop-loss at ₹268 for the target of ₹252. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹259 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹256. Long-term investors, on the other hand can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220.
Infosys (₹1,163.4)
Though, Infosys is stuck in a sideways range for more than two weeks the price action keeps the bias positive. Inability to break above ₹1,169 can keep the stock range-bound between ₹1,130 and ₹1,169 for some time. But a decisive break above ₹1,169 can boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹1,200 initially. It will also increase the possibility of the stock breaching the psychological ₹1,200 mark and targeting ₹1,250 or even higher levels over the medium term. The 21-day moving average at ₹1,138 and a trend line at ₹1,130 are the key supports to watch. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below ₹1,130 decisively. Such a break, though less likely, will increase the possibility of the stock falling towards ₹1,110 and ₹1,100 in the short term. The region between ₹1,100 and ₹1,085 is a strong support for Infosys. A strong fall breaking below ₹1,085 is unlikely as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at lower levels and limit the downside. Both long and medium-term investors can hold the long positions.
RIL (₹912) 
 RIL fell sharply last week after failing to extend its up-move beyond the key resistance at ₹960. The stock tumbled over 6 per cent intra-week and made a low of ₹888.3. However, it managed to bounce from this low recovering some of the loss and closed 3.7 per cent lower for the week. The broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range within which the stock has been trading over the last few months, remains intact. The immediate outlook is unclear. Cluster of moving average (21-, 100- and 55-day moving average) resistances are poised in between ₹922 and ₹928. If RIL manages to break above this resistance cluster, it can rally again towards ₹950 and ₹960 — the upper end of the range. But inability to break above the ₹922-₹928 resistance zone and a pull-back move in the coming days can keep the stock under pressure. In such a scenario, RIL can fall below ₹900 and test ₹880 and ₹870 — the lower end of the range. Traders can continue to stay out of this stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges.
Tata Steel (₹605.6)
Contrary to our expectation, Tata Steel tumbled breaking below ₹630 last week. The stock plummeted 10 per cent in the past week and the stop-loss levels on the long positions have been breached. The uptrend that has been in place since 2016 is under threat now and initial signs of a trend reversal are emanating on the charts. The stock has closed below the 200-day moving average for the first time in two years. Cluster of resistances in between ₹635 and ₹650 can cap the upside. Intermediate bounces may find fresh sellers coming into the market at higher levels in the above-mentioned resistance zone. As long as the stock remains below ₹650, the outlook will remain bearish and a fall to ₹580 cannot be ruled out. A strong break below ₹580 will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹555. Short-term traders can go short on rallies at ₹630 and ₹650. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹685 for the target of ₹560. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹605 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹585."
266,2018-03-12,Infosys,"Infosys to voluntarily delist from Euronext’s Paris, London bourses
Five years after it listed on NYSE Euronext’s (NYX) London and Paris markets, Infosys has decided to voluntarily delist.
In a statement to the exchanges, the country’s second largest software exporter said: “Infosys announces its intent to voluntarily delist from Euronext Paris and Euronext London Exchanges.”
The announcement came after market hours. Infosys shares closed at ₹1,185, up by almost 2 per cent when compared to Friday’s close.
No change to ADS
Also, there will be no change to Infosys’ American Depositary Share (ADS) count, capital structure and the total stock float, as a result of the proposed delisting from the above exchanges, Infosys clarified. By offering ADS, foreign companies get access to a wider investor base, which can also lower costs of future capital.
Industry watchers opine that this development will not have any material impact on the company’s performance in Europe, which contributed to 24.4 per cent in the December-ended quarter, a growth of 18.7 per cent when compared to the year-ago period. There will be of no fundamental impact and the development is not of much consequence, said Urmil Shah, IT analyst, IDBI Capital.
Additionally, ADS holders can continue to trade on the Euronext Paris and London exchanges until the date of completion of the proposed delisting.
Once the approval for delisting goes through, a sales facility will be provided by Infosys to the holders of ADS trading on the Euronext Paris and London exchanges. ADS holders, who opt for the sales facility, will be able to sell on the NYSE in accordance with Euronext Paris and Euronext London rules. However, those shareholders who do not opt for the sales facility can continue to keep their ADS and will be able to trade on the NYSE.
Further, the delisting is a first for the company, which will continue to trade on NYSE and the Indian exchanges.
One of the primary reasons for delisting was due to the low average day trading volume of Infosys shares, which does not justify the related administrative requirements, which are expensive in those exchanges."

265,2018-03-15,Infosys,"Infosys to open tech hub in Connecticut

Setting up US hubs: The move is being seen as a bid to woo the Trump administration that has been critical of outsourcing firms for “unfairly” taking jobs away from the US workers.


Setting up US hubs: The move is being seen as a bid to woo the Trump administration that has been critical of outsourcing firms for “unfairly” taking jobs away from the US workers.

India’s second largest software services firm Infosys will set up a new technology and innovation hub in Hartford, Connecticut, and hire 1,000 American workers in the state by 2022.
Last year, Infosys had announced setting up of four such hubs and hiring about 10,000 locals in the US over the next two years.
Infosys has already inaugurated its first technology and innovation hub in Indianapolis, Indiana, and has announced another such hub in Raleigh, North Carolina, and a design and innovation hub in Providence, Rhode Island.
The move was also seen as a bid to woo the Trump administration that has been critical of outsourcing firms for “unfairly” taking jobs away from the US workers.
The hub in Connecticut will have a special focus on insurance, healthcare and manufacturing, Infosys said in a regulatory filing late last night.
""We are excited to announce the expansion of our presence in Connecticut and to create 1,000 technology jobs in the state,"" Infosys President Ravi Kumar said.
He added that the investment will further strengthen Infosys’ ability to serve clients’ needs throughout the New England region and expand the local workforce.
“Hartford’s position as the insurance capital of the world, paired with Connecticut’s world-renowned academic institutions, will place Infosys in close proximity to valued clients and accelerate the recruitment of highly-skilled local talent,” he said.
The Hub will include insurance and healthcare labs that focus on smart underwriting, claims fraud, Internet of Things and Cloud, and will employ data security and data-sharing features to help Infosys clients comply with all applicable privacy laws while promoting innovation, the statement said.
Infosys will also leverage the hub to train its employees and develop pioneering techniques with agile, development operations, cloud and information security projects, it added."

SBI is vulnerable for further fall (₹234.6)
The ongoing scams and frauds in the banking sector is keeping stocks in this space under pressure. SBI tumbled about 7 per cent breaking below the crucial support level of ₹241. The fall last week indicates that the downtrend is intact and is gaining strength. Key resistances are at ₹241 and ₹250, which can cap the upside in the short term. A fall to ₹226 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement support level is likely in the short-term. A bounce back-move to ₹241 from ₹226 cannot be ruled out. However, the upside is expected to be capped as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels and cap the upside. An eventual break below ₹226 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or 190 over the medium term. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go short at current levels and at ₹240. Keep the stop-loss at ₹248 for the target of ₹205. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹232 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹227. The downside pressure will ease only if SBI breaches ₹250 decisive. But that looks unlikely in the near term.
Short-term view is negative for ITC (₹256.3)
Weakness in the broader markets dragged ITC below the key support level of ₹258 in the final trading session of the week. The ₹258-₹259 resistance region can cap the upside in the near term. As long as the stock trades below ₹259, a fall to ₹251 or ₹250 is likely. Short-term traders can go short at the current levels and at ₹258. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹259.5 for the target of ₹251. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹255 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹253. A bounce-back thereafter from ₹250 can ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹257 or ₹258 again. But if ITC declines below ₹250 decisively, the downmove can then extend to ₹247 or ₹244 over the medium term. But such a fall will be a good buying opportunity for the medium and long-term investors. Cluster of supports are poised between ₹245 and ₹230, which can halt the downtrend. A strong upward reversal thereafter will mark the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend. Long-term investors can hold the long positions and accumulate at ₹247. Retain the stop-loss at ₹220.
Infosys consolidated within its uptrend (₹1,167.4)
The ₹1,140-₹1,130 region continues to provide strong support for Infosys. The stock made a low of ₹1,140 and has reversed higher from there. The ₹1,130-₹1,200 sideways range remains intact. Intermediate resistance is at ₹1,177. A break above it can take Infosys higher to ₹1,200. Inability to break above ₹1,200 can pull the stock lower and continue to keep it in the ₹1,130-₹1,200 range. A strong break above ₹1,200 is needed for Infosys to gain fresh momentum. Such a break can take it higher to ₹1,210. Further break above ₹1,210 will see the stock rallying to ₹1,250 and even higher thereafter. On the other hand, Infosys will come under pressure if it breaks below ₹1,130. Such a break will see an intermediate dip to ₹1,100. Further fall below ₹1,100 is less probable as fresh buyers may emerge at lower levels. Also, the overall bias is bullish for Infosys to breach ₹1,200 and extend its upmove over a medium and long term. So any intermediate fall below ₹1,130 will be a good buying opportunity. Both medium- and long-term investors can hold the long positions.
Immediate outlook is unclear for RIL (₹892.8)
RIL was stuck in a narrow range in the past week. The stock was range-bound between ₹887 and ₹911 and has closed on a slightly negative note. The immediate outlook is unclear. Traders can stay out of the stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges. As long as the stock remains below ₹900, a fall to test the crucial support at ₹870 is likely. A break below ₹870 can drag RIL to ₹860 and ₹850 thereafter. But if the stock manages to sustain above the support at ₹870 and reverses higher, the downside pressure will ease. Such a reversal will indicate that the broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range is intact. The stock has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time since last November. Intermediate resistance is at ₹900 and cluster of resistances are poised between ₹920 and ₹930. A strong break above ₹930 will pave way for a fresh rally to ₹960. RIL will gain fresh bullish momentum only if it breaks above ₹960 decisively. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹1,000 or even higher thereafter.
Downtrend intact for Tata Steel (₹566.6)
As expected, Tata Steel extended its fall for the third consecutive week. The stock was down 5.6 per cent last week. Tata Steel has tumbled 16 per cent over the last three weeks. Immediate support is at ₹550. But the stock is vulnerable to break below this level in the coming days as the downtrend has gathered momentum and any upmove would find fresh selling interest coming into the stock. Such a break can drag it to ₹540 or ₹530. The region between ₹540-₹530 is a strong medium-term support. Since the stock has been falling continuously over the last few weeks, a relief rally from the ₹540-₹530 support zone cannot be ruled out. An upward reversal from this support zone can take the stock higher to ₹585 or even ₹600. But if Tata Steel breaks below ₹530 decisively, it can tumble to ₹500 or even ₹480 over the medium term. Traders can hold the short positions. Revise the stop-loss lower to the level of ₹585. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹575 as soon as the stock dips to ₹555. Book profits at ₹545."
263,2018-03-29,Infosys,"‘Infosys, Wipro have not developed allotted land’
The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has found deficiencies in land allotment procedures in Telangana, leaving vast stretches of allotted land untapped for development by IT companies.
“Land allotments were recommended based on applications by the firms. However, no method was prescribed to assess the extent of land actually required by the firms. As a result, IT firms retained or held the allotted land without full development or utilisation,” the CAG said in its report on Telangana finances in 2016-17, released on Thursday.
For one, Infosys did not take up development in 296 acres (Phase II and III) out of the 446 acres allotted in May 2007. Wipro utilised only nine out of the 101 acres at Gopanapally allotted to it in June 2007, leaving 92 acres of the land idle without any development.
“No investments were stipulated in respect of four firms (Brahmani Infratech, Honeywell Technology, Taksheel Solutions and Linus Infotec). Wipro did not invest the amounts proposed by it, indicating lack of commitment. Nanotech failed to bring in any investment,” it pointed out.
The CAG said the government had accepted the audit observations. “They said it was done in order to attract multinational companies. Infosys had submitted its development plans for approval, while Wipro was being served with a show-cause notice calling for its plan,” it said.
The Department did not monitor development of infrastructure by IT firms in respect of land already allotted. The IT firms held the land allotted without development for years."

Near-term outlook is unclear for SBI (₹250.1)
Contrary to expectations of a fall, SBI witnessed a sharp bounce in the past week. The near-term outlook is unclear. The price action will be key in deciding the next move. Key resistance is in the ₹257-260 region. If SBI manages to breach ₹260 decisively, the downside pressure will ease. Such a break will trigger a relief rally towards ₹271 — a 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level — initially on the back of short covering. Further break above ₹271 will see the up-move extending towards ₹283 — a trendline as well as the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance level. A rally beyond ₹283 is unlikely as the upside is expected to be capped at this level. SBI will come under pressure again only if it breaks below ₹240 decisively. Such a break will bring the bears back into the stock. It will signal the resumption of the overall downtrend and increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹200 and ₹190 over the medium term. Traders can stay out of the stock and wait for a clear trend and a trade signal to emerge.
ITC can remain range bound (₹255.9)
ITC was volatile in the past week. Though it opened with a wide gap-down, it managed to reverse sharply higher closing the gap and surged to a high of ₹265.75 on the same day. However, ITC failed to sustain and came off from this high again, giving back most of the gains made during the week. It closed on a flat note. A dip to revisit the crucial support at ₹250 is likely in the near term. If the stock manages to bounce again from ₹250, it can move higher and remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. But if ITC declines below ₹250 decisively, a fresh fall to ₹247 or ₹244 is possible. As mentioned last week, a cluster of supports poised between ₹245 and ₹230 can halt the current downtrend. A strong upward reversal thereafter will mark the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend. So, investors holding the long positions can accumulate at ₹247 and retain the stop-loss at ₹220. A strong break above ₹265 will bring fresh bullish momentum and take ITC higher to ₹270 and ₹275 thereafter.
Short-term view is negative for Infosys (₹1,134.4)
Infosys tumbled 2.8 per cent last week. The short-term outlook has turned negative after last week’s strong fall. Immediate resistances are at ₹1,140 and ₹1,145. A break above ₹1,145 can ease the downside pressure and take the stock up to ₹1,160. Further break above ₹1,160 will increase the possibility of the stock revisiting ₹1,200 levels. If Infosys remains below ₹1,145, it can be under pressure. While below ₹1,145, a fall to ₹1,090 or ₹1,085 is likely in the short term. Further fall below ₹1,085 is less probable now. But if Infosys breaks below ₹1,085, it will indicate a double-top formation on the chart. This will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹1,050 or even ₹1,030 over the medium term. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go short at current levels. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,165 for the target of ₹1,085. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹1,120 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹1,110. However, the fall to ₹1,050-₹1,030 will be a good buying opportunity for long-term investors.
RIL hovers above a crucial support (₹882.8)
RIL seems to lack strength to breach the psychological level of ₹900. The stock made a high of ₹910 only to close 1.1 per cent lower for the week. A crucial support is at ₹870, which is likely to be tested. If RIL manages to bounce from there, the downside pressure will ease. It will keep the broader ₹870-960 sideways range intact and increase the possibility of the stock bouncing back to ₹900 and ₹920 initially. Further break above ₹920 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹960 — the upper end of the range in the short term. On the other hand, if RIL breaks below ₹870, it can fall to ₹860 or ₹855. A trend line as well as the 200-day moving average supports are poised between ₹860 and ₹855. A strong break below ₹855 will bring renewed pressure for the stock. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹820 or even ₹800 on the back of profit-booking. This down move below ₹855 could be swift as stop-loss orders are likely to be triggered below this level.
Tata Steel can consolidate sideways (₹570.9)
Tata Steel managed to sustain above the key support level of ₹550 last week. However, the price action on the chart reflects that the stock lacks strong buying interest. It made a high of ₹598.85 and has come off from it. A revisit to ₹550 is likely in the near term. A bounce from ₹550 can take it back to ₹600 again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹550 and ₹600 can be seen for some time. If Tata Steel manages to breach ₹600, the downside pressure can ease and a rally to ₹635 is possible. Further break above ₹635 looks unlikely at the moment as the bias continues to remain bearish. As such, an eventual break below ₹550 can take Tata Steel lower to ₹535. A strong break below ₹535 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or ₹500 over the medium term. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go short. Keep the stop-loss at ₹605 for the target of ₹515. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹555 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹545."
261,2018-04-01,Infosys,"Consider a call option on Infosys
 
The outlook for the stock of Infosys (₹1,131.80) remains positive, as long as it rules above ₹1,020. Infosys finds an immediate support at ₹1,097 and the next one at ₹1,068. A decisive close below the second key support level can drag the stock towards ₹743. The stock finds an immediate resistance at ₹1,175 and a close above that will trigger a fresh rally that can lift the stock to new highs above ₹1,120.
F&O pointers: Infosys futures witnessed a healthy roll-over of 88 per cent to April series. The Infosys April futures closed at ₹1,136.85 against the spot price of ₹1,131.80, signalling a roll-over of long positions. Option trading indicates that the stock is likely to move in the ₹1,100- ₹1,200 band where concentration of open interest positions is strong.
Event: Infosys will announce its full-year and quarter ended March 2018 results on April 13. Besides, it will also give an outlook statement for next year. Given the volatile situation, investors would do well to go by the outlook for Infosys.
Strategy: We advise traders to consider buying Infosys ₹1,160-call, which closed at a premium of ₹25.20. As the market lot for Infosys contract is 600 shares, this will cost ₹15,120 for traders.
 




 
A maximum loss of premium paid (₹15,120) will happen if Infosys fails to move past ₹1,185.20 at the time expiry.
However, profit potential is high if Infosys manages to climb sharply, particularly post results. We advise traders to hold the position at least till the end of third week of April contracts.
Traders could consider exiting the position if the premium dips to ₹7.50. The strategy is for traders who can withstand risk and volatility of market.
Follow-up: Hold Gail India position. As the stock adjusted to 1:3 bonus issue, the revised target is ₹412 and the stop-loss is ₹315."

SBI forms a bullish reversal pattern (₹259.8)
After an initial struggle, SBI managed to breach decisively the 21-day moving average (₹250) resistance towards the end of the week. The stock was up 3.8 per cent last week and has closed on a strong note. The level of ₹250 will now be a good support for the stock. The price action on the chart since March indicates the formation of an inverted head and shoulder pattern. This is a bullish reversal pattern. The neckline resistance of this pattern is at ₹262. A strong break above ₹262 will confirm this pattern and take SBI higher to ₹268 initially. Further break above ₹268 will pave way for the next targets of ₹275 and ₹280. On the other hand, if SBI fails to rise past ₹262 in the coming days, it can fall back towards ₹250 levels again. A break below ₹250 can then drag the stock lower to ₹240 levels again. Traders can go long on a break above ₹262. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹252 for the target of ₹280. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹268.
Near-term view is positive for ITC (₹260.6)
ITC remained broadly in a sideways range all through last week. The near-term view is positive. A rise to test the ₹264-₹266 resistance region is possible in the coming days. Whether ITC breaks above ₹266 or not will be key in deciding the next move. A strong break above ₹266 will bring renewed strength to the stock. Such a break can then trigger a fresh rally to ₹274. The rally to ₹274 will also mark the end of the downtrend that has been in place since February. On the other hand, if ITC fails to breach ₹266 and reverses lower in the coming days, it can fall to ₹260 or ₹257 again. The region between ₹257 and ₹255 is a key near-term support. A bounce from this support zone can take the stock ITC higher again and keep it range-bound between ₹255 and ₹266 for some time. But if ITC declines below ₹255, it can fall to test the crucial support level of ₹250. A break below it can drag it to ₹250. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at the level of ₹220.
Short-term outlook is negative for Infosys (₹1,129.3)
Infosys remained subdued and range-bound between ₹1,120 and ₹1,150. Key resistances are at ₹1,147 and ₹1,155. As long as the stock remains below these resistances, a fall to ₹1,090 cannot be ruled out. A bounce from ₹1,090 will ease the pressure and take Infosys higher to ₹1,150 levels again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range bound between ₹1,090 and ₹1,200 for sometime. But if Infosys breaks below ₹1,090, a fall to ₹1,050 or even ₹1,030 is possible over the medium-term. But further fall below the ₹1,050-₹1,030 support zone is unlikely as fresh buyers can emerge in the market. As mentioned last week, a fall to ₹1,050-₹1,030, if seen, will be a good buying opportunity for long-term investors. Traders who have taken short positions last week can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,165 for a revised target of ₹1,105. Move the stop-loss lower to ₹1,125 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹1,115. Medium and long-term investors can hold the long positions.
Near-term view is positive for RIL (₹909.7)
RIL snapped its four-week fall. The stock surged 2.8 per cent last week. Key resistances are at ₹921 and ₹928, which are likely to be tested in the near term. Inability to breach these hurdles can pull the stock lower to ₹900 or ₹890 levels again. But if RIL manages to breach ₹928 decisively, it can gain momentum. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹960 over the short term. A strong break above ₹928 will boost the momentum. Such a break can take RIL higher to ₹960 in the short term. The level of ₹960 is a crucial resistance for RIL. A strong break above it will pave way for the next targets of ₹1,000 and ₹1,020 over the medium. But if RIL reverses lower from ₹960, it can fall back to ₹920 or ₹900 levels again. In such a scenario, the broader ₹870-₹960 range will remain intact. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go long at current levels. Keep the stop-loss at ₹885 for the target of ₹955. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹920 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹935.
Resistance to cap the upside in Tata Steel (₹586.3)
Tata Steel remained lower but in a narrow range in the past week. The stock has been consolidating over the last couple of weeks within its overall downtrend. The level of ₹600 is a key near-term resistance. A strong break above it is needed for the downside pressure to ease. Such a break can trigger a corrective rally towards ₹630. But the upside is expected to be capped as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels. As such, a further rally beyond ₹630 looks less probable now as the bias continues to remain bearish on the stock. A revisit of ₹550 is likely in the coming days. A break below ₹550 can take the stock lower to ₹535 initially. Further break below ₹535 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or even ₹500 over the medium term. Traders who have taken short positions can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹605 for the target of ₹515. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹555 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹545.

The country’s second-largest software services major Infosys today reported 2.4 per cent growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 3,690 crore for the quarter ended on March 31, 2018. It had posted a net profit of Rs 3,603 crore in the year-ago period according to IFRS accounting norms, Infosys said in a BSE filing.
Revenues of the Bengaluru-based firm grew 5.6 per cent to Rs 18,083 crore in the January-March quarter compared with Rs 17,120 crore in the year-ago period.
The company said it expects revenue for 2018-19 to grow in the range of 6-8 per cent in constant currency terms and 7-9 per cent in US dollar terms. For the full fiscal 2017-18, profit was up 11.7 per cent at Rs 16,029 crore, while revenues grew 3 per cent to Rs 70,522 crore over the previous year.
“I am pleased with our healthy revenue growth, profitability, and cash generation in Q4. Our robust performance is a reflection of the strong impact we have with our clients and the dedication of our employees,” Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said.
He added that the company will execute its strategy around the four pillars -- scaling digital business (USD 2.79 billion in revenue currently), energizing client’s core technology landscape via AI and automation, re-skilling employees, and expanding localisation in markets like US, Europe, and Australia.
Infosys COO Pravin Rao said the company will be rolling out compensation increases for a large part of its workforce, effective April 1. The Infosys Board in its meeting today decided to retain the current policy of returning up to 70 per cent of the free cash flow of the corresponding financial year. “In addition to the above, out of the cash on the Balance Sheet, the Board has identified an amount of up to Rs 13,000 crore to be paid to shareholders,” it added.
This will be done through a special dividend of Rs 10 per share (resulting in a payout of about Rs 2,600 crore in June 2018). Also, an amount of up to Rs 10,400 crore has been identified to be paid out to shareholders for the Financial Year 2019 in a manner to be decided by the Board."

The controversial Panaya subsidiary, which led to the fall of Vishal Sikka, has now been put up for sale along with another subsidiary Skava. 
Infosys also announced a timeline for the sale stating it expects to sell both of them within March 2019. “The announcement of a timeline is quite surprising. One usually sells off a company and then makes an announcement. I am unable to understand the reason for declaring a timeline,” said Shriram Subramaniam of InGovern, a proxy advisory firm. 
The Israeli firm Panaya was bought by Infosys in 2015 for $200 million but a couple of years later, it ran into controversy after a whistleblower alleged to the management certain wrongdoings while acquiring the company. Later this turned out to be a bone of contention between the founders and then CEO Vishal Sikka, along with the Infosys board.
Subsequently, an internal audit committee set up by Infosys found no evidence supporting the whistleblower’s allegations.
However, Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy had demanded that the full report by Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher on these whistleblower’s allegations be made public. After Sikka resigned, the Infosys board — under its new Chairman Nandan Nilekani — gave a clean chit to the acquisition, and dismissed allegations of wrongdoing.
A strategic review
At the fourth-quarter results’ announcement, CEO Salil Parekh, after a strategic review meeting, said the acquisitions of Panaya and Skava were not in line with the new strategy. The company expects the sale to be completed by March 2019. Infosys has around 40 subsidiaries.
Infosys said upon reclassification, an impairment loss of ₹118 crore ($18 million) in respect of Panaya has been recognised in the consolidated profit and loss for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2018. Accordingly, assets amounting to ₹2,060 crore ($316 million) and liabilities amounting to ₹324 crore ($50 million) in respect of the disposal group have been reclassified and presented as ‘held for sale’,” Infosys said.
The corresponding write-down in the investment value of Panaya in the standalone financial statements of Infosys is ₹589 crore ($90 million), it added.
When asked whether this would impact future acquisitions, Chief Financial Officer MD Ranganath pointed out that the company will always look at strategic fits whenever it’s looking at an acquisition."

In the three months since Salil Parekh took charge as CEO, IT services major Infosys seems to have carried out some heavy-lifting — taking decisions ranging from rewinding its strategy to focussing on digital opportunities, shrugging off the predecessor’s SaaS model and putting up for sale its subsidiaries Skava and the controversial Panaya. 
The company also announced on Friday that it has acquired WongDoody Holding, a US-based digital agency, for $75 million. 
By taking the decision to exit the two subsidiaries, Infosys has decided to write off $90 million in Panaya on a standalone basis and about half of the $200 million it paid in February 2015 to acquire the Israeli technology firm. The combined value of both the subsidiaries is $316 million, with liabilities of $50 million. It has been classified as “held for sale” in its books. 
Parekh, who took over after Vishal Sikka resigned in August last year, believes that there are four pillars around which the company will be built. These are “scaling our Agile Digital business, energising our client’s core technology business using automation and AI, employee reskilling and expanding our localisation efforts in the US, Europe and Australia”, said Parekh.
Infosys said its net profit grew 2.4 per cent YoY to ₹3,690 crore for the fourth quarter of FY18. Revenues for the same period increased 5.6 per cent to ₹18,083 crore YoY. 
Infosys further said it expects revenue for FY19 to grow 6-8 per cent in constant currency terms and 7-9 per cent in US dollar terms. The revenue guidance is “in line with our expectations”, said Sanjeev Hota, AVP – Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

“On April 13, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire WongDoody...for a total consideration of up to $75 million including contingent consideration and retention payouts, subject to regulatory approvals and fulfilment of closing conditions,” Infosys said in a regulatory filing. The move, Infosys said, would strengthen the company’s creative, branding and customer experience capabilities. The acquisition is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, subject to customary closing conditions.
“With Infosys Digital Studios spanning the globe — from Bengaluru and Pune to New York, London, and Melbourne — the addition of WongDoody strengthens Infosys’ ability to fulfil the needs of global clients for comprehensive digital transformation solutions required to meet customer demand for next-generation, enhanced customer experiences,” it said.
Founded in 1993, WongDoody is headquartered in Seattle and has an office in Los Angeles. Its has clients across industries like telecommunications, consumer electronics, healthcare and consumer packaged goods.
“We are focussed on partnering with global brands and CMOs to help them on their digital transformation journeys, by developing a digital experience services ecosystem with services ranging from strategy, design and user experience, to creative and digital marketing across the customer experience value chain,” Infosys President and Deputy COO Ravi Kumar S said.
WongDoody’s expertise in driving innovative creative solutions is already yielding significant results in Infosys’ initial collaborations with clients, and this acquisition will further enhance the company’s capabilities in this space, he added."

253,2018-04-14,Infosys,"Infosys: Key metrics steady in a seasonally weak quarter

The fall in profit was as a result of the reversal of income-tax expense of $225 million in December 2017 quarter.


The fall in profit was as a result of the reversal of income-tax expense of $225 million in December 2017 quarter.

Starting with a clean slate and getting Infosys back to its old ways of being ‘boringly predictable’ seem to be focus points of the company’s management led by its new CEO, Salil Parekh.
And Infosys’ steady March quarter numbers, which met market expectations, its decision to sell a contentious subsidiary acquired by his predecessor (Panaya) and a largely stable guidance for FY19, all seem to point to a slow and but sure return to matching industry growth rates.




 
 
Client additions, key metrics such as utilisation and volumes, traction in key verticals have all been healthy, though attrition has increased continuously for the past three quarters.
During the fourth quarter, the company’s revenues increased by 1.8 per cent sequentially in dollar terms, while net profits declined by 28.2 per cent. The fall in profit was as a result of the reversal of income-tax expense of $225 million in December 2017 quarter.
Healthy client additions
In a seasonally weak quarter, Infosys managed volume (person months billed) growth of 1.1 per cent, and also managed an increase in realizations. Utilisation continues to be healthy, at 84.7 per cent.
The company added four customers in the $25 million category and one each in the $50 million and $75 million buckets, which suggests that the management transition hasn’t affected client traction.
Two large verticals − Manufacturing & Hi-tech, and Energy, Utilities, Communications − grew at a pace that was faster than the overall company’s revenue rate. Banking and Retail segments grew marginally. Thus growth has been reasonably broad-based for Infosys.
Attrition, at 19.6 per cent, continues to increase steadily and may be a cause for concern for the company.
Breaking from the past
Infosys has guided for a 7-9 per cent revenue growth rate for FY19, bang in line with the trade body Nasscom’s projected rate for the industry. By putting its subsidiary, Panaya, on sale (expected by March 2019), the company wants to steer clear of all the contentious issues surrounding its acquisition.
By bringing focus back on its core offerings and giving an increasing digital thrust to its service lines, Infosys looks set to achieve its guidance.
Dividend payouts, which were historically quite conservative, have also seen an increase. In fact, with the special dividend of ₹10 announced, the yield has risen to a heady 3.7 per cent, when 2 per cent used to be the ‘normal’ level."

Resistance caps the upside in SBI (₹251.2)
SBI failed to breach the key resistance level of ₹262 last week. The stock reversed sharply lower after making a high of ₹265.25 and closed 3.3 per cent down for the week. Immediate support is at ₹248. If SBI manages to sustain above this support, a bounce-back move to ₹262 is possible again. 
 




 
 
A strong break above ₹262 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹270 initially. Further break above ₹270 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹283 or ₹285. On the other hand, if SBI declines below the immediate support at ₹248 in the coming days, it can come under more pressure. Such a break can drag it to the crucial support level of ₹240. Whether SBI breaks below ₹240 or not will decide the next move. A bounce from ₹240 can keep it range-bound between ₹240 and ₹260 for some time. But a strong break and a decisive close below ₹240 can bring renewed pressure on the stock. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or ₹190 over the medium term.
ITC may remain range-bound (₹260.8)
ITC rallied as expected to test the resistance at ₹266. But it failed to sustain higher and came-off sharply from ₹268.2 and closed the week on a flat note. Inability to bounce from the current levels can keep the stock under pressure. Support is at ₹258. A break below it can drag the stock lower to ₹255 or even ₹250 in the short term. The region between ₹251 and ₹250 is a crucial support that has been limiting the downside since November. An upward reversal from this support region can take ITC higher to ₹260 and ₹265 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below ₹250 decisively. Such a break can take the stock lower to ₹245 or ₹244 initially. Further break below ₹244 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹235 or even lower. On the other hand, if ITC bounces from the immediate support at ₹258, it can move up to ₹265 or ₹267. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220
Infosys maintains its uptrend (₹1,169)
Infosys snapped its three-week fall as the psychological support at ₹1,100 held well. The stock made a low of ₹1,105 and surged to close the week 3.3 per cent higher. This upward reversal keeps the ₹1,100-₹1,200 sideways range intact. Infosys has been stuck in this range since February. As long as the stock remains above the ₹1,150-₹1,140 support zone, the possibility is high of it extending its upmove towards ₹1,200. Inability to break above ₹1,200 can drag Infosys lower to ₹1,150 or even lower. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound for some time. But if Infosys manages to breach ₹1,200 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹1,250 or ₹1,270. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 or even higher levels over the long term. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below the ₹1,100-₹1,090 support
Key resistance ahead for RIL (₹938.85)
RIL extended its rally for the second consecutive week. The stock surged 3.2 per cent in the past week. The near-term view remains positive. Support is in the ₹925-₹920 region. The stock can extend its current upmove and test the crucial resistance level of ₹960 in the coming days. Inability to break above ₹960 and a subsequent pull-back move will take the stock lower to ₹920. In such a scenario, the broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range will remain intact. RIL has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time. On the other hand, the stock will gain fresh momentum if it manages to breach ₹960 decisively. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹1,000 and ₹1,020 in the coming weeks. The outlook will turn negative only if the stock breaks below ₹870. But such a break look less probable at the moment. Traders who have taken long positions last week can hold it with a revised stop-loss at ₹920 and target of ₹955. Move the stop-loss further higher to ₹938 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹945.
Tata Steel lacks strength (₹593.3)
Tata Steel inched higher for the third consecutive week. The stock was up 1.5 per cent. Immediate support is at ₹588 — the 21-day moving average that is likely to be tested in the initial part of the week. An upward reversal from there will see the current rally extending towards ₹620 or even ₹630 in the coming weeks. Further break above ₹630 looks less likely now as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels. A pull-back fromthe level of ₹630 can drag the stock to ₹600 or even lower levels thereafter. On the other hand, if Tata Steel declines below the 21-day moving average (₹588) support, it can fall to ₹570 or ₹560. Further break below ₹560 will then increase the likelihood of the stock falling towards ₹550 or ₹545. The region between ₹550 and ₹545 is a key medium-term support. A break below ₹545 can take the stock lower to ₹535 initially. Further break below ₹535 will then increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or ₹500 over the medium term."

The company has forecast 6-8 per cent revenue growth for the year to March in constant currency terms and FY19 operating margin range at 22-24 per cent.


The company has forecast 6-8 per cent revenue growth for the year to March in constant currency terms and FY19 operating margin range at 22-24 per cent.

Shares of Infosys fell as much as 6 per cent in the morning trade as the company has reported less-than-expected margin guidance for the fiscal year 2018-19.
After opening on a weak note, the stock fell to an intra-day low of Rs 1,099, down 5.98 per cent from its previous closing price. On the NSE, the stock fell 5.92 per cent to an intra-day low of Rs 1,102.00.
The stock was the biggest contributor to the losses on the Sensex.
Global brokerage Nomura in a research note said “growth weakness in developed markets, BFSI and retail is a negative. We expect the stock to react negative to the margin guidance cut.''
The report further noted that “guidance for FY19 growth is in line with consensus, though a cut in EBI margin guidance to 22-24 per cent (as against 23-25 per cent earlier) was a disappointment''.
Infosys, on April 13, had reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 3,690 crore, or Rs 16.98 per share, in January-March 2018 quarter as compared to Rs 3,603 crore, or Rs 15.77 a share in the same period a year back.
For 2018-19, Infosys expects its revenue to grow in the range of 6-8 per cent in constant currency terms and 7-9 per cent in the US dollar terms. For financial year 2018-19 Infosys expects operating margin range at 22 per cent to 24 per cent.
The company said its revenues grew 5.6 per cent to Rs 18,083 crore in the January-March quarter compared with Rs 17,120 crore in the year-ago period. Net profit was up 11.7 per cent at Rs 16,029 crore, while revenues grew 3 per cent to Rs 70,522 crore in FY2017-18 over the previous year. 
According to Morgan Stanley, FY19 margin guidance has surprised negatively. Credit Suisse says EBITA margin guidance of 22-24 per cent (versus 24.3 per cent in FY18) is 100 bps below expectations and is disappointing given that the currency is slightly supportive for now.
Morgan Stanley expects the stock to pare some gains, given strong YTD price performance and disappointing outlook for next year. Infosys stock had risen 12.4 per cent this year up to Friday."

Salil Parekh, CEO and MD, Infosys

Salil Parekh, CEO and MD, Infosys
   -  BL

 With its four-pillar strategy that pivots around “Digital”, Infosys is refocussing on its client’s needs and has chosen to shift away from products, which was Vishal Sikka’s legacy.
At its fourth-quarter results announcement, CEO Salil Parekh revealed the final contours of a four-pillar strategy, which to a lot of industry watchers had resembled predecessor Sikka’s gameplan. 
For example, Parekh outlined “scaling our Agile Digital business, energising our client’s core technology business using automation and AI, employee reskilling and expanding our localisation efforts in the US, Europe and Australia” as his new mantra. 
This somewhat resembles Sikka’s “renew and new”, reskilling (using Design Thinking), and hiring in the US was a given once the regime changed in the US.
So, what has changed? Jimit Arora, Partner, Everest Group, explained that as part of the strategy review, the leadership has been decisive in terms of what aligns with Agile Digital. In this regard, Skava and Panaya were not fitting in strategy and hence being divested. This clear articulation of what the company seeks going forward seems to have convinced industry watchers.
Digital transformation
 “The focus on (and investment in) being relevant to clients as they make pace on their Digital Transformation journeys,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, Founder, Greyhound Research. Infosys has made two acquisitions in the digital space recently WongDoody and Brilliant Basics. “Several of its previous acquisitions have not been as successful as they had hoped and the leadership wants to refocus in the digital areas,” said Phil Fersht, CEO and Chief Analyst, HfS Research.
Panaya, the Israeli company which Infosys acquired in 2015 for $200 million, along with Skava, fitted well into Sikka’s vision. The automation technology firm was building new line-up of products and tools to make automation for large customers more efficient and cost-effective.
Was it really good, questioned an analyst. The answer in part can be seen from the numbers. Panaya has made losses of ₹83 crore and in a 2015 annual report it was mentioned that Panaya Pty is based in Melbourne but sources told BusinessLine that it is yet to commence operations. Parekh has taken a call to exit the two subsidiaries, write off $90 million in Panaya on a standalone basis and the combined value of both the subsidiaries is $316 million, with liabilities of $50 million. It has been classified as “held for sale” in its books. The decision to sell Panaya is interesting and reflects on the mindset of the new management under Parekh’s leadership. 
A merger isn’t just about the technology that comes with it but also the overall fitment in the broader scheme of things like cultural match which is the hardest task amongst all. 
“We must give Salil the time to explain and more importantly justify his decision to sell Panaya and not necessarily read it as undoing what Vishal did,” opined Gogia.
Other portfolios
However, Parekh has faith in other products portfolio — which includes Nia and Finacle — which he said would remain part of the portfolio going forward.
Have all these changes unnerved clients? For the most part, strategic inflection is largely a non-issue for clients, according to Arora, adding that the number of $50, 75 and 100 million clients have increase modestly (it added six clients in all these three buckets). This comes as music to Infosys’ ears especially when some of its clients have been dissatisfied with its services.
As the strategy has been laid out, Infosys is in the midst of a new normal — wherein technology shifts are rapid, the old model of billing man-hours are getting irrelevant and so is sending techies from India to the US in the backdrop of stricter curbs around H-1B visas.
All this will have an impact on margins. Infosys has acknowledged this by lowering of FY19 operating margin guidance to 22-24 per cent from 23-25 per cent for FY18. Typically, lower margin expectations help companies mine their clients better."

   -  Bloomberg


Armed with contracts worth $3 billion in the 2018 fiscal, and a revamped digital strategy, Infosys is hoping to grow at a faster clip.
In a call with analysts, COO Pravin Rao said that Infosys had seven large deal wins in the January-March quarter, which amounted to a Total Contract Value (TCV) of $905 million. However, in the last twelve months, large deal TCV declined by 12 per cent when compared to 2017. TCV indicates the total possible value of a deal but cannot be shown in the books.
A see-saw year
India’s second largest software major has been going through a see-saw year, partly due to spat between the co-founders and former CEO Vishal Sikka, which ultimately resulted in the latter quitting the company. Along with technology shifts, a stricter H-1B visa environment resulted in the company revising its guidance repeatedly last fiscal. Finally, Infosys grew its topline by 7.2 per cent, its lowest in as many years.
While Rao was optimistic about Infosys’ prospects in the 2019 fiscal, he also cautioned that certain top accounts in the US are witnessing some toughness. Infosys gets in excess of 70 per cent of its revenues from the US and BFSI segment. Absence of growth uptick in BFS (excluding Insurance) and Retail &CPG vertical which together account to 39 per cent of total revenues is a concern. Tepid growth in developed markets is also a concern, said Urmil Shah, IT Analyst, IDBI Securities.
The insurance industry continues to be impacted by changing technologies and consumer behaviour and insurance companies are under pressure to innovate fast. Among verticals, BFSI vertical revenues were up 0.1 per cent QoQ in constant currency and Retail &CPG vertical revenues were down 0.7 per cent QoQ in constant currency. Among Geographies, North America revenues were up 0.1 per cent QoQ in constant currency and revenues from Europe were down 0.2 per cent QoQ in constant currency.
New account openings
We expect growth for us in the vertical driven by new account openings and our offerings around McCamish and NIA, said Rao.
The larger play of Infosys around its 4 pillar strategy laid out by CEO Salil Parekh is expected to reap dividends soon. Also, the US economy in early stages of an economic rebound is expected to be good news for Indian outsourcing companies. “Strong traction in Europe and ‘green-shoots’ in North American market are positives,” said Madhu Babu, Research Analyst-Institutional Equities, Prabhudas Lilladher.
Infosys is not out of the woods as yet and this is reflected in the guidance (6-8 per cent in constant currency for 2019).
Shareholders rewarded
Infosys announced that as per the capital allocation policy for fiscal 2019, the Board has decided to pay off $2 billion (₹13,000 crore) and a special dividend of ₹10 per share, which translates into additional payout of $400 million. This $2 billion or approximately 4 per cent of its equity has been planned through a share buyback later this year."

Salil Parekh, CEO and MD, Infosys

Infosys has outlined a three-year roadmap, made some tweaks to its sales and reskilling initiatives, and plans to hire a significant number of non-engineers in its effort to get back to industry-leading growth.
In a call with investors, new CEO Salil Parekh outlined his vision for the company. “In the first year, we will stabilise the company; in the second, we will build momentum and in the third year, accelerate our business,” he said.
Four-pillar strategy
Parekh reiterated to analysts some of the things he said on April 13 — the four-pillar strategy and his effort to reignite growth at a time when some foreign institutional investors have reduced their holding in the company. At the end of March 2018, institutional holding dropped from 38.31 per cent to 35.24 per cent, as per shareholding data. Last fiscal, Infosys’ annual revenue grew 5.8 per cent. The overall market opportunity for digital is $160 billion.
Parekh told investors that since taking over, in January 2018, he had met many clients. They were, he said, unanimous that Infosys knows them best and would best help them navigate the complex business environment as a result of the rapid technological shifts such as digital and automation.
He explained his four-pillar strategy, which includes scaling digital business, energising its client’s core technology business using automation and AI (that forms more than 60 per cent of its business), employee reskilling, and expanding its localisation efforts in the US, Europe and Australia. Digital revenues are pegged at $2.79 billion or 25.5 per cent of its total business. Parekh, who had announced the acquisition of WongDoody, a digital company, also reiterated that the company will look at more M&A opportunities.
The call, with all the top leadership, including COO Pravin Rao and CFO MD Ranganath, dialing in, briefed investors in detail on the strategy that Parekh envisions for a “strong” Infosys.
As a part of this, the company gave out more details on a slew of initiatives. On the technology front, it has identified AR/VR, blockchain, 3D printing or additive manufacturing. Apart from the technological push, the company, which pioneered the model of hiring from engineering colleges and deploying them in projects that involved managing the backend system of banks, is now looking to hire designers. Rao said that the revamped hiring would include going to campuses in India and the US. “More importantly, a diversified talent mix would include designers who can create a user interface which appeals to our customers and building an onsite pyramid, a first in our 37 years existence would be our focus,” said Ravi Kumar S, President and Deputy COO.
This talent pool will be hired in India and the US, in the fields of economics, liberal arts and other connected skills and upskilling them through gamification techniques. The same strategy would be pursued in Europe, Rao added.
Infosys is also betting on automation in many of its service lines like IT infrastructure management and software testing. For example, in testing, Infosys is looking to increase automation from the present 40 per cent to 70 per cent.
Finally, on the sales front, Infosys has put in place a new approach that would focus on specific geographies."

India’s major IT company Infosys today announced that it would open its US Education Centre in Indianapolis, which the company said would train American workers and create 1,000 additional jobs.
The announcement made in the presence of the US Vice President Mike Pence comes a year after the company announced that it would establish an innovation hub in Indianapolis. In all, Infosys efforts in Indianapolis would create 3,000 new jobs in this state of Pence. Infosys, Pence said “brings new chapter in the life of the growing Indiana economy.”
The development is a reflection of President Donald Trump’s focus on job creation and making policies focused in this regard, he said. Pence thanked Infosys for joining Trump’s agenda on job creation.
The US Education Center of Infosys spread over 125,000 sq feet at an unused terminal of the former international airport of Indianapolis. Observing that this centre will deepen roots of Infosys in Indiana, its president Ravi Kumar said last year Infosys made an announcement of committing 2,000 American workers in Indiana. This centre would add another 1,000 local American employees in Indiana.
Since last May, Infosys has hired 4,000 American workers out of the 10,000 it plans in the next few years. “We have announced additional technology and innovation hubs in North Carolina, Connecticut and if one of its kind design hub in Rhode Island. We have announced educational partnerships with Perdue, North Carolina community college system, and we’re continuing to bear on bridging the skills gap in the United States,” Kumar said."

Taking four lakh people back to the classroom isn’t an easy task, even for a cash-rich company like Tata Consultancy Services, the $100-billion (market cap) IT services company.
Is it easier for TCS to hire skilled workforce from the outside? Not really. The skills required are not to be found. So, TCS embarked on its reskilling journey a few years ago, where it decided to train its entire workforce. More than 2,40,000 have already been trained.
In the Mysuru campus of Infosys, trainees have to go through a six-month training programme which includes studying of three programming languages, instead of one earlier. Additionally, courses on analytics and cloud computing are taught. According to Infosys COO UB Pravin Rao, the company is looking to replicate this training model in the US.
“Unless we make sure our people have the technical capabilities, we will not be able to serve our customers. Moreover, it isn’t viable to rehire and let go of existing people,” Ajoy Mukherjee, Chief HR Officer at TCS, told BusinessLine. However, the unanswered issue is the extent to which the industry will sustain investments in reskilling at a time of shrinking margins. According to Mukherjee, even if it were possible to hire enough talent from outside, it would be hard to replicate customer relationships, organisation-fit and the industry knowledge base that existing employees have.
Capgemini is taking a ‘going back to basics’ approach to retrain its workforce. “Compared to what is traditionally done, digital services (or the gamut of new skills needed) create a very different skill requirement as well as different ways of working,” says Ashwin Yardi, COO-India, Capgemini.




 
 
Tackling cost
Companies also provide training through internal online portals and mobile apps that make it easier to train at low cost.
“We track the competency of individuals at 4 levels — E0 to E3. Based on that, we expose them to the new technology. With four lakh people, classroom training for everyone is not possible and learning has to use digital technologies. Our virtual classrooms offer gamified learning. From this platform, you should be able to log into a server where you can solve problems by actually developing code on newer technologies,” says Mukherjee.
IBM has created a massive open online course platform for its one-lakh odd employees in India. “It has broken down learning into byte size. Most people have day jobs, so time becomes an issue. So with byte size modules, they can learn at their pace,” says Chaitanya N Sreenivas, Vice-President & HR Head, at IBM India/South Asia.
Companies such as TCS are open to hiring professionals with any educational background, provided they’ve spent time in new technology areas. Google, Amazon and IBM often don’t stress academic credentials either; proficiency in coding, and in areas where skills are in short supply, holds the key."

Infosys’ independent director Ravi Venkatesan has resigned from the board with immediate effect, the company said today.
The Bengaluru-based IT major, in a statement, said that Venkatesan plans to pursue an “exciting new opportunity“.
I joined the board at a time when Infosys was beginning the complex journey of transitioning from founder-led to professional management. This was also a time of tectonic industry shifts. I am pleased that this mission has been accomplished. Infosys is strong, in good hands, and is gaining momentum,” Venkatesan said.
An independent director since 2011, Venkatesan also served briefly as co-chairman before successfully transitioning this responsibility when Nandan Nilekani became chairman in August 2017.
It may be recalled that India’s second largest IT exporter, Infosys, had seen protracted stand-off between its founders led by NR Narayana Murthy and the previous management over issues of corporate governance and compensation to former executives.
The tussle had led to the sudden resignation of the then CEO Vishal Sikka last year.
Salil Parekh joined the Bengaluru-based company as the new CEO in January this year."

Ravi Venkatesan, who has been an independent director since 2011, has resigned from Infosys.
Venkatesan, who also briefly served as a co-chairman at India’s second largest software exporter, said in a statement that he is stepping down from the board to accept an “exciting new role”. He joined the board when Infosys was transitioning from a founder-led management to a professional one. 
“This was also a time of tectonic industry shifts. I am pleased that this mission has been accomplished. Infosys is strong, in good hands, and is gaining momentum,” he added. He continues to be the Chairman of Bank of Baroda,
Venkatesan’s exit comes in the backdrop of a slew of changes at Infosys following a bitter feud between its founders and Vishal Sikka, along with the board. In April 2017, at the height of the feud, Venkatesan was elevated as co-chairman (from independent director), a first for the IT major. Further, the move was then widely seen as a step to end the public spat. “If you got to fly a plane through a storm, it is helpful to have a co-pilot in the cockpit,” he had said then.
At the time of the tussle between the founders and the board, former Infosys CFOs TV Mohandas Pai and V Balakrishnan had repeatedly asked for the complete reconstitution of the board alleging that its members had failed in their corporate governance duties. In April, following the Uday Kotak Committee recommendations on corporate governance, Infosys appointed Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw as the Lead Independent Director of the board, which means that she can represent all independent directors in the board."

SBI (₹250.9)
SBI rose 3.7 per cent last week. This rally has eased the downside pressure and turned the near-term view positive. So, traders can exit and book loss on the short positions taken a couple of weeks back. An immediate resistance is in the ₹253-₹254 region, which is likely to be tested in the early part of the week. A break above ₹254 can take the stock higher to ₹259 and ₹260. Further break above ₹260 can extend the up-move to ₹264 and ₹265. The level of ₹265 is a crucial short-term resistance. Inability to breach this hurdle can pull the stock lower to ₹255 and ₹250. In such a scenario, SBI can remain range-bound between ₹230 and ₹265 for some time. If SBI breaks above ₹265 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹270 or even ₹280 levels in the coming weeks. It will also signal that the downtrend that has been in place since November last year has come to an end.





 ITC (₹283.9) 
 ITC reversed higher last week and was up 2.3 per cent. The 55-week moving average at ₹277 has been providing strong support for the stock over the last two weeks, keeping the overall bullish outlook intact. However, a crucial resistance cluster is ahead in the ₹285-₹290 region. ITC has to breach above ₹290 decisively to keep the current uptrend intact. Price action on the charts suggests that the possibility is high of the stock breaching ₹290 and targeting ₹295 initially. Further break above ₹295 will take the stock up to ₹305. On the other hand, if ITC reverses lower from ₹290 , it can fall to ₹280 or ₹275 — a key short-term support. An immediate break below ₹275 looks less probable at the moment. If the stock manages to sustain above ₹275, a range-bound move between ₹275 and ₹290 can be seen in the short term. If ITC breaks below ₹275, a fall to ₹270 or ₹268 is possible. Long-term investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220.





 Infosys (₹1,181) 
 Infosys remained subdued and closed on a mixed note last week. The 21-day moving average at ₹1,167 had provided strong support for the stock. As long as Infosys remains above this support, It can break above the crucial ₹1,200-₹1,205 resistance region. Such a break will mark the end of the prolonged sideways consolidation phase. The stock has been stuck in the band between ₹1,100 and ₹1,200 since January. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,205 will take the stock higher to revisit the previous highs of ₹1,278. Such a rally will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 and ₹1,375 levels over the medium term. The near-term view will turn negative if the stock declines below the 21-day moving average. In such a scenario, a fall to ₹1,140 or ₹1,135 levels is possible. Further break below ₹1,135 will see the down-move extending to ₹1,100 . Both medium- and long-term investors can hold their long positions.





RIL (₹988.5)
RIL managed to reverse higher in the past week and has recovered most of the loss made in the week earlier. The stock surged 3.6 per cent last week. Though the weekly chart gives a mixed picture, the daily candles leave the near-term outlook positive. A test of the psychological resistance level of ₹1,000 is possible. A strong break above ₹1,000 will take the stock higher to ₹1,030 . Whether RIL breaks above ₹1,030 or not will decide the next move. Inability to break above ₹1,030 can pull the stock lower to ₹1,000. A break below ₹1,000, will see the down-move extending towards ₹980 or ₹970. On the other hand, if RIL manages to break above ₹1,030 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum and rally towards ₹1,085. The 21-day moving average at ₹959 is a key support. The outlook will turn negative only if RIL declines below this support. A strong break below ₹959 will then increase the possibility of the stock falling to ₹930 or even ₹900 .





 Tata Steel (₹606)
Tata Steel has risen, breaking above the key psychological resistance level of ₹600 last week. This has eased the downside pressure and is also slightly turning the bias positive. The key resistance is in the ₹615-620 region is likely to be tested in the coming days. Traders who have taken short position last week on rallies at ₹590 and ₹596 can exit and book loss at current level. Whether Tata Steel breaks above ₹620 or not will be key in deciding the next move. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹620 ease the downside pressure. Such a break will take the stock higher to ₹635 or even to ₹650. This move above ₹620 could be swift on the back of short covering. On the other hand, if Tata Steel reverses lower from ₹620, it can fall to ₹600 initially. If it manages to bounce from this psychological support, a range-bound move between ₹600 and ₹620 can be seen for some time. But a break below ₹600 can drag the stock lower to ₹585."

 SBI (₹239.2)
SBI began the week on a positive note, but it was short-lived. The stock touched a high of ₹257.2 and came off sharply from there to close 4.7 per cent lower for the week. The near-term view is bearish. A fall to test the crucial support level of ₹231 is likely. If SBI manages to bounce from ₹231, the downside pressure would ease. A relief rally to ₹250 or ₹255 is possible then. Also, a range-bound move between ₹231 and ₹255 is possible for some time in such a scenario. But if SBI breaks below ₹231 decisively, it can come under renewed pressure. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or ₹195 over the medium term. The region around ₹195 is a strong long-term support which can halt the downtrend that has been in place since November last year. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go short at current levels and on rallies at ₹245. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹265 for the target of ₹200. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹240 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹225.





 ITC (₹282.1)
ITC was volatile last week. The stock has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹276 and ₹290 over the last three weeks. Last week’s candle on the weekly chart reflects indecisiveness in the market. This leaves the short-term outlook unclear for the stock. A breakout on either side of ₹276 or ₹290 will decide the next move. If ITC declines below ₹276, it can fall to test the ₹269-₹267 support region. A bounce from this support zone will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹280 and ₹285 again. But a strong break below ₹267can drag the stock lower to ₹260 or even ₹255. On the other hand, if ITC manages to sustain above ₹276 in the coming days and breaches ₹290, it can move higher to ₹296 initially. Inability to break above ₹296 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹289. But a strong break above ₹296 will see the stock rallying to ₹303 or ₹305. Such a rally will also mark the end of the downtrend that has been in place since last July. Long-term investors can hold the long positions.





 Infosys (₹1,183.7)
Infosys has been testing the psychological level of ₹1,200 over the last four consecutive weeks. However, the stock seems to be lacking fresh buyers to take it decisively above ₹1,200. It has been facing strong resistance around ₹1,210. A strong break above this hurdle is needed for Infosys to gain fresh momentum. Such a break will see Infosys testing the previous highs of ₹1,278 levels. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 and ₹1,375 levels over the medium term. On the other hand, if Infosys continues to remain below ₹1,200, a fall to ₹1,160 is possible in the near term. It will keep the broader ₹1,100-₹1,200 sideways range intact. The stock has been stuck in this range since January. Further break below ₹1,160 can drag the stock to ₹1,140 or ₹1,135. A bounce from ₹1,135 can trigger a relief rally to ₹1,160 or ₹1,170. But a strong break below ₹1,135 will see Infosys falling towards ₹1,100. Further fall below ₹1,100 is unlikely. Both medium- and long-term investors can hold the long positions.





 RIL (₹933.4)
RIL tumbled over 5 per cent last week. The stock hovers above an immediate support level of ₹929 — the 21-week moving average. This support has been limiting the downside over the last four weeks. If RIL manages to sustain above this support and reverse higher, it can move up to test ₹1,000 levels again. Inability to break above ₹1,000 can continue to keep the stock range-bound between ₹929 and ₹1,000 for some more time. But a strong break above ₹1,000 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹1,030 or ₹1,035. The region between ₹1,030 and ₹1,035 is a crucial medium-term resistance for the stock. Whether RIL breaks above ₹1,035 or not will be key in deciding the next move. On the other hand, if RIL breaks below the immediate support level of ₹929, it can fall to ₹900 or ₹890 in the coming days. A crucial medium-term trend deciding support is poised around ₹890. A decisive weekly close below ₹890 may trigger a sharp corrective fall to ₹850. So the price action around ₹890 will need a close watch.





 Tata Steel (₹591.5)
Tata Steel surged, breaking above the key ₹615-₹620 resistance region last week, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made an intra-week high of ₹636.3 and reversed sharply lower, giving back all the gains made and closed 2.5 per cent lower for the week. Technically, the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance at ₹631 has halted the up-move and triggered the reversal. This indicates that the downtrend that has been in place since January is intact. Immediate resistance is inbetween ₹600 and ₹605. Inability to bounce from the current levels and breach this hurdle can continue to keep the stock under pressure. A fall to ₹570-₹565 is likely. If Tata Steel manages to bounce from ₹565 to ₹570, a relief rally to ₹600 is possible. But a break below ₹565 can drag the stock to ₹550. Traders with high risk appetite can go short on rallies at ₹598 and ₹605. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹615 for the target of ₹570. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹590 when it moves down to ₹580."

Infosys has marginally reduced its CEO-to-employee pay ratio. 
The Median Remuneration of Employees to top management personnel was 273 in the 2018 fiscal, according to data from its annual report. In the 2017 fiscal, the ratio of median employee pay to the CEO was 283. Also, former Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka, who quit the company in August last year, was paid ₹13 crore in the 2018 fiscal. Median pay refers to average pay of an employee in an organisation
Sikka’s total compensation for fiscal 2016 and 2017 was ₹45 crore, according to annual report data. The lack of clarity on his pay-related information was one of the reasons for straining of relations between co-founder NR Narayana Murthy and the key Infosys management then. 




 
Also, this was construed as bad corporate governance and Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of proxy firm InGovern Research, had told BusinessLine then that there is asymmetry of information in the information provided to shareholders and in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure. Infosys had filed a copy of Sikka’s employment agreement to the SEC on May 18, 2016.
For the 2018 fiscal, COO Pravin Rao drew ₹8.22 crore in salary, same as in 2017 fiscal. However, he was given ₹4 crore worth of RSUs and 43,000 ESOPs totalling 70,250 units. David Kennedy, who quit along with Sikka and some other members of the Board, took home salary of ₹7.75 crore, which includes ₹6 crore of severance pay. Amongst other Infosys top management personnel, Mohit Joshi, President, saw his pay go up by more than 50 per cent. He took home ₹10.31 crore, in comparison to fiscal 2017 when he took ₹6.79 crore.
CFO MD Ranganath drew ₹7.98 crore, Presidents Ravi Kumar S and Rajesh K Murthy took home more than ₹19 crore."
233,2018-05-22,Infosys,"Sikka got Rs 13-cr remuneration from Infosys for FY18 
 Former Infosys Chief Executive Vishal Sikka, who quit in August last year after a protracted row with the company’s founders, received Rs 12.92 crore remuneration for 2017-18. He had received Rs 16.01 crore in 2016-17, according to the company’s annual report for last fiscal, ended March 31. Sikka had resigned as CEO and Managing Director effective August 18, 2017 and as Executive Vice-Chairman effective August 24.
According to the report, Sikka’s remuneration for 2017-18 included “$0.25 million (approximately Rs 1.60 crore) and $0.21 million (About Rs 1.34 crore) as part of 90 days base pay in lieu of notice and variable pay, respectively for fiscal 2018 on account of resignation”.
Additionally, it said, “remuneration for fiscal 2018 includes Rs 6.78 crore on account of exercise of 70,772 RSUs (restricted stock options)”.
Salil Parekh, who joined Infosys in January this year as the CEO and Managing Director, received a remuneration of Rs 3.98 crore. Infosys Chief Operating Officer UB Pravin Rao saw his remuneration going up by 5 per cent to Rs 8.22 crore last fiscal, from Rs 7.80 crore in the previous year. While he had stepped into the interim role after Sikka’s resignation as the company conducted the search process for the CEO role, Rao’s salary had remained unchanged. CFO MD Ranganath saw a 68 per cent hike in remuneration for last fiscal to Rs 7.98 crore, from Rs 4.75 crore in 2016-17.
Ravi Venkatesan, who quit the Infosys board earlier this month, had seen his remuneration increase by 38 per cent to Rs 1.43 crore. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw drew a remuneration of Rs 1 crore as director on the Infosys board. Nandan Nilekani, who was brought on Infosys Board on August 24, 2017, has voluntarily chosen not to receive any remuneration for his services rendered to the company.
“We have gone through turbulence, but the resilience of the company has shone through and we are now in a very safe and stable place. The strategy refresh we undertook in the last six months has clearly outlined the way forward for us,” Nilekani wrote in the report. He added that Infosys has a strong execution leadership team in place to steer the company towards its goals.
Former General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer David Kennedy, who also quit last year, took home salary of Rs 7.75 crore, including a severance pay of Rs 6 crore. Mohit Joshi (President) saw his remuneration increase by 52 per cent to Rs 10.31 crore. Ravi Kumar S (President and Deputy COO) and Rajesh K Murthy (President) took home Rs 9.54 crore and Rs 9.58 crore respectively."
232,2018-05-23,Infosys,"Another Infosys whistleblower points to lapses in governance standards; writes to SEBI, SEC

A whistleblower has fired a fresh salvo at Infosys, questioning the corporate governance standards at the software major.
In a letter to SEBI and US regulator SEC, the whistleblower accused co-founder and chairman Nandan Nilekani of conniving with the current Board to “bury” all the “wrongdoings” of the earlier Board. The letter added that Infosys has “quietly revealed in the annual report that they had signed agreements for mutual release of claims” with three directors who left the company last year.
Infosys had disclosed in its annual report that former Chairman R Seshasayee, and Jeff Lehman, the former head of nominations and remunerations committee of the board, had signed a mutual release of claims. A mutual release agreement is a document that allows for disputes to be settled quickly, in a professional manner.
At the time of his resignation, former CEO Vishal Sikka entered into a separation agreement, which included a mutual release and non-disparagement obligation, which is a clause used to protect an employee’s reputation.
Soon after Sikka and Seshasayee quit the Infosys Board, Nilekani was brought in to take charge. Nilekani had said at that time that he would review the prior investigations (concerning corporate governance lapses) conducted by third-party investigators in a “calm and dispassionate” manner. Later, he gave a clean chit.
The whistleblower had written to the regulators in April and had questioned the Board’s accountability in the acquisitions of Panaya and Skava, which was at the root of the bitter spat between co-founder NR Narayana Murthy and the former Board. In its annual results for the fiscal year 2018, Infosys announced its decision to put both the subsidiaries on the block.
“I think the current board led by Nandan Nilekani is a huge disappointment. He had forgotten the core principles of Infosys and failed to uphold the highest traditions of corporate governance practised by Infosys earlier,” the whistleblower said in the letter. A few days ago, Ravi Venkatesan who has been an independent director since 2011, resigned from Infosys to accept an “exciting new role”.
In the aftermath of the clean chit given to the acquisitions, Murthy had also asked that the report be made public.
Since the spat began, some executives had vociferously called for the Board to be reconsituted."

Salil Parekh, CEO and MD, Infosys


Infosys today said that stricter visa curbs in certain developed markets will not act as an impediment for growth as it has a strong local hiring plan.
Addressing analysts at Morgan Stanley’s Annual India Summit, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said: “I think, in general, what we see in many of our markets such as Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the US, independent from the current political situation, the overall sentiment is to enhance more local job activities.”
What we are building with this localisation approach is really gearing towards making sure that our business model evolves in the right way, without sacrificing the best elements of the business model for the future, he added. Recently, Parekh outlined that local hiring and training manpower in the US form a part of the company’s revamped four-pillar strategy to reignite growth. This is similar to the strategy it has pursued in India, wherein it hires engineers from colleges and trains them.
Infosys has already hired 4,000 in the US and last year, India’s No 2 software exporter had said that it will hire 10,000 graduates from colleges. This development also comes in the backdrop of the Donald Trump administration already tightening the screws around H-1B and now even planning to terminate a provision in H-4 visa, which allows a spouse of an H-1B holder to work in the US. 
This is likely to impact 70,000 H-4 visa holders who work onsite for companies such as Cargill and Goldman Sachs. A decision on this will be taken any time between July and September.
“We think the environment is such that if we do the things the right way, this is going to further expand the business. So, we don’t see it as a constraint but the dynamic globally is different and the business model needs to evolve to adapt to it,” he said."

 IT major Infosys today said its proposal for voluntary delisting of its American Depositary Shares (ADSs) from Euronext’s Paris and London exchanges has been approved by the Board of Directors of the two bourses.
In March this year, Infosys had announced its intention to delist the ADSs on account of the “low average daily trading volume of Infosys ADS on these exchanges, which is not commensurate with the related administrative requirements.”
“The voluntary delisting of its ADS’ from the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges has been approved by the Board of Directors of Euronext Paris SA and by Euronext London Ltd,” Infosys said in a BSE filing today.
During the five-year period of the listing on Euronext Paris and Euronext London, the average daily trading volume of Infosys ADSs was significantly lower than its average daily trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), it pointed out. It added that there will be no change to its Infosys share/ADS count, capital structure or float as a result of the delisting from the above exchanges.
Also, Infosys ADSs will continue to be listed on the NYSE. “The delisting procedure will allow Infosys ADS’ listed on the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges to be sold on the NYSE. A sales facility will be provided to the holders of Infosys ADS’ trading on the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges...” it said.
The sales facility is slated to begin on June 18 and end on June 29. The last day of trading of Infosys ADSs on Euronext Paris and Euronext London will be July 4 and will be delisted the following day. Holders of such shares can choose to participate in the sales facility to sell their ADSs on the NYSE in accordance with Euronext Paris and Euronext London rules, Infosys said.
If they choose otherwise, they can continue to keep their ADSs and be able to trade them on the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges until the date of completion of the proposed delisting and only on the NYSE thereafter. Infosys had started trading on Euronext Paris and Euronext London in February 2013."

We are doing this one in small bits and pieces as we see big potential and relevant for our digital native enterprise, this will be a new launch under the same umbrella of data do more, which was largely focussed on the internal data, this will help us conceal the second party data or third-party data,” Satish HC, Executive Vice-President, Data & Analytics — Infosys, told BusinessLine. 
The new offering will be a part of the company’s Data & Analytics division but it is being built as a new unit, which will have its own set of management. 
“We are setting aside a dedicated leadership team in my organisation – I would set it up like a dedicated component just like an analytics team and then there is a technology and services team and there is a team which looks after the start-up and partner ecosystem, this is going to be as one such independent entity but part of the same data ecosystem,” Satish said.
Two components
The data marketplace will have two components to it — data and platforms. For the data part, Infosys will work with data providers such as media companies and technology companies such as Google and Microsoft, and create solutions to problems that haven’t been solved yet. 
For the platform part, Infosys will work with enterprises to pull all the relevant data from across the organisation and look at how they can monetise it. Infosys will also connect them with potential clients and help package the information in a way that can be consumed by individual companies. 
“There are enterprises looking at monetising data they already have. They often struggle with how to monetise it. That’s where Infosys will help them monetise it and then connect them to potential customers on the platform,” Satish said. 
Pact with Microsoft
One such partnership will be with Microsoft where the Bengaluru-based firm will help Microsoft create solutions for small and medium businesses using Microsoft Azure. 
“Microsoft is going big on small and medium business, so if we create solutions that are not very heavy to build, we can actually help save some of the solutions on Microsoft Azure platforms, where their offerings go beyond, technology, software and cloud. It will also be solutions for small of medium-size retailer for example,” Satish said."

 IT major Infosys has reduced its per capita electricity consumption by 53 per cent against the baseline year of 2008. 
The company, which released its 11th Annual Sustainability Report, said 43.7 per cent of the company’s electricity requirements (amounting to more than 100 million units a year) is sourced from renewable sources. 
“Today, the company has an installed capacity of 46.1 MW of solar across India and has reduced demand for connected electrical load by 32 MW through retrofits across its campuses over the last eight years,” report said.
The company has 19 LEED platinum-rated buildings, 4 GRIHA 5-star rating buildings, and 2 LEED EB (existing building) campuses with the highest levels of green certification. 
Its green building footprint extends to 11.7 million sq ft. Additionally, 10.8 million sq ft is undergoing certification. 
Carbon emission
In line with the company’s commitment to become carbon neutral and focus on social development alongside carbon emission reduction, Infosys has implemented six community-level carbon offset projects which included one household biogas project, four high-efficiency improved biomass cook stove projects, and one rural electrification project.
As of fiscal 2018, Infosys covered over 1,600 villages in six districts across Karnataka, Rajasthan, Odisha, Maharashtra and Jammu & Kashmir through the household biogas project, high-efficiency improved biomass cook stove projects, and the rural electrification project.
Through these projects Infosys reduced carbon emission by 153,309 tCO2e as of March 31, 2018 bringing cheer to over 1,00,000 families in rural India.
Conservation of water
The company has reduced its per capita water consumption by 57 per cent in 2017-18 (against the baseline year 2008), and its year-on-year reduction is 20 per cent. 
In the current year, Infosys has recycled close to 2.5 million kl of water - this amounted to 83 per cent of the total water withdrawal. 
Scientific waste disposal
Infosys has 17 biogas and composting plants that treat more than 3.6 million kgs/annum of organic waste. 1.2 million kgs/annum of STP sludge is treated at the Bengaluru and Mysuru campuses through automated solar dryers.

VISHAL_SIKKA1

 
 
Teradata has filed a lawsuit against SAP for copyright infringement, trade secret misappropriation and antitrust violations, which could drag its former CTO Vishal Sikka to court.
Cloud and data analytics company Teradata has alleged that SAP lured it into a joint venture to gain access to its Intellectual Property (IP), steal its trade secrets and use them to quickly develop and introduce a competitor product. Subsequently, SAP HANA was launched in a short span of time, after which the German major terminated its joint venture with Teradata, as per the company filings.
The lawsuit has been filed in the US District Court of Northern District of California. Teradata has alleged that SAP has been indulging in this kind of anti-competitive behaviour for a decade. The lawsuit coincides with the time when Sikka was the brain behind SAP’s HANA.
When contacted, a SAP spokesperson said: “SAP was surprised to learn of the complaint filed by Teradata. Although SAP generally does not comment on pending litigation, SAP may issue a statement, if appropriate, after it has had an opportunity to review the complaint.”
The lawsuit has not named any individual as party to this. But the terms and conditions of Sikka being held accountable for this is unclear but in the process of court proceedings, Sikka may be summoned to court. In the US, once a lawsuit is filed, both parties get to look at each other’s documents, emails, which take several months and eventually names of parties involved come out. This means that theoretically, he could be called to depose. A lot of it is driven by contracts. Generally, an employee is contractually legally bound to depose even if he or she is no longer working with the company, according to Ravi Bhola, Partner, K&S Partners, an IP law firm. An email sent to Sikka went unanswered.
Teradata has additionally alleged that SAP is now attempting to coerce Teradata customers to forcibly use SAP HANA, in exchange for upgrading their ERP systems. Teradata has not minced any words in its lawsuit and has even called out SAP’s product as “inferior” and its efforts as neither pro competitive nor innovative.
The filing also mentions that by doing this, SAP was preventing Teradata access to customer information and given the high cost of switching to alternate ERP systems, customers get locked in. This, Teradata has deemed as anti-competitive. SAP has a dominant position in ERP.
Teradata has sought an injunction, which is a court order by which an entity or an individual is restrained from performing a particular act, against SAP, in addition to monetary damages, which has not been quantified yet."

Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani has reassured shareholders that the company is stable and is ready to get back into faster growth mode.
Addressing shareholders in the 37th Annual General Meeting (AGM), which also coincides with the 25th year of listing in the stock markets, Nilekani said that India's second largest software exporter has taken several steps to remedy stability concerns.
“When I stepped for the second time into Infosys in August last year, one of the concerns raised was about the company's stability and we have taken several steps to remedy this. We have a stable board and management and everyone is united,” he said. Now the focus will be in relentless execution, Nilekani added.
Nilekani's assurance comes in the backdrop of a bitter battle between some of the founders and some former board members and Vishal Sikka, which distracted the company and resulted in 5.8 per cent growth, lesser than Nasscom growth projection for the industry.
Nilekani further pointed out that under the leadership of new CEO Salil Parekh, Infosys introspected internally and discussed with several of its clients the way forward. “We now have evolved from leveraging classic software development methods to approaching software creation in a more agile, digital ways,” he said.
The Chairman concluded his speech by saying that it is the resilience of the team that has seen Infosys through some rather testing times in the year that went by and helped deliver 'strong' financial performance. Infosys closed the year with $10.8 billion in revenues."
222,2018-06-24,Infosys,"Infy board stable, will deal with all issues: Nilekani 

Infosys shareholders questioned the management on the Panaya acquisition, but Chairman Nandan Nilekani reassured them that there is a stable Board that will ensure that such things do not happen again.
The acquisition, which caused a spat between founder Narayana Murthy and former CEO Vishal Sikka over corporate governance issues (raised by a whistleblower), eventually resulted in the latter leaving the company. 
At the AGM, shareholders repeatedly brought up the Panaya acquisition. “Why is the company selling Panaya when it is incurring losses,” asked Sadananda Shastri, a veteran shareholder. PN Nayak, another shareholder, said that the company should clarify why so many subsidiaries are incurring losses. 
CEO Salil Parekh answered cryptically, sayinig that the company would be careful in its due diligence process in future acquisitions. 
As in every AGM, at least four of them wanted Murthy to be on the Board, to which Nilekani said that all suggestions from shareholders would be considered. The last time co-founder NR Narayana Murthy along with his family members attended an AGM was in 2016. 
Nilekani pointed out that under the leadership of new CEO Parekh, Infosys introspected and also discussed the way forward with several of its clients. 
Infosys closed the year with $10.8 billion in revenues. By and large, investors this year were happy with the company’s performance, especially in a year when it finished a ₹13,000-crore buyback and a dividend payout of ₹43.50 per share for fiscal 2018."

   -  REUTERS

 A whistleblower has written to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and SEBI accusing Infosys of not making adequate financial disclosures and remaining silent in the role of a former board member in the Panaya acquisition.
In a letter, a copy of which is available with BusinessLine, the whistleblower has said that Form 20F document, which needs to be filed every year, has not been done, yet. On June 23, Infosys concluded its 37th AGM and, as per the rules, the American Depository Receipt (ADR) shareholders were made to vote on the financial statements without getting the full information, the letter mentions.
Form 20F is a document mandated by the SEC for companies listed in the US and gives details of key risks and the effectiveness of internal controls, which are relevant for ADR shareholders to approve the financials. This document has to be filed within six months of the end of the company’s fiscal year. Infosys has till September to file this document but in the past it has been doing so in May/June before its AGM.
The whistleblower has alleged that this year no document has been filed and the AGM is over. “Typically, a company delays its annual filing with SEC only when there is an ongoing investigation by SEC,” the note said. 
Questions raised
The note also raises a question of a possible link between the former co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan, who resigned from the board recently, and an ongoing investigation of Infosys. “Is there any ongoing investigation by SEC and is there any connection to Venkatesan leaving the company and any investigation,” the note asks. 
When contacted, an Infosys spokesperson said: “The company will file Form 20F within the stipulated time and has sufficient time to do so. Speculation that Form 20F is not filed in time or there is an ongoing SEC investigation is baseless and incorrect.”
The investigation, which the note refers to, is regarding the acquisition of an Israeli company Panaya, which set off a bitter feud between Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy and some former members of the board such as Vishal Sikka and R Seshasayee over the valuation and propriety of the deal. A few months ago, the whistleblower had sent an email seeking answers to what changed Panaya from a “strategic acquisition to a completely value less one”.
Subsequently, in April, after Sikka and Seshasayee left and Nandan Nilekani took over as Chairman, the new CEO, Salil Parekh, along with the current board members decided on an impairment loss of ₹118 crore ($18 million) in respect of Panaya and Skava. Both the companies’ assets amounted to ₹2,060 crore ($316 million) and liabilities to ₹324 crore ($50 million) and have been reclassified and presented as ‘held for sale’.
Venkatesan was on the board when this decision was taken. “I request you to require the company to inform the shareholders on the exact reasoning for the delay as well as confirm whether any ongoing investigation with SEC is pending,” the note concluded.
Mohan R Lavi, a Chartered Accountant, said that, technically, Infosys still has time to file its Form 20F and may be close to taking a decision on disposing of Panaya. 
Parekh, on the sidelines of the AGM, told reporters that the company would be careful in its due diligence process in future acquisitions."

The move comes close on the heels of a whistleblower writing to market regulator SEBI and its US counterpart SEC, accusing Infosys of not making adequate financial disclosures and the role of a former board member in the Panaya acquisition, which could have prompted SEC to conduct an investigation.

 As Infosys looks to report its first-quarter numbers, it has an enviable task to follow the strong set of numbers posted by TCS.
Salil Parekh, the new CEO of Infosys, gets into his second quarter, with one eye on how the old legacy business is transitioning with the adoption of automation. His other eye would be on how “digital”, an all encompassing term for work done using cloud, AI, analytics and the works, is progressing. While he has categorically stated that the first year would all be about ‘stabilising’, analysts are interested in seeing where this stability is headed. 
“The company-specific issues seem to be a thing of the past. Now, we expect large deal wins and project ramp ups to gain momentum,” said Urmil Shah, IT analyst, IDBI Securities. In Q4, Infosys disclosed Total Contract Value (TCV) amounting to $905 million, which is high, especially in a March-ended quarter which tends to be slow in comparison to Q1 and Q2. 
However, Infosys, which used to be the bellwether when it came to performance, has lost that tag to TCS, which has consistently outperformed its rival on almost every parameter due to internal issues and an inability to quickly transition into new tech areas. 
New technologies
For Infosys, transition issues and a high profile management spat have had an impact on the performance. “We will keep an eye on how Infosys is adopting new technologies for its clients,” said DD Mishra, Research Director, Gartner.
Infosys is expected to post a revenue growth of 5.6 per cent, better than the 1.8 per cent growth it posted in the fourth quarter of 2018 fiscal, according to analysts that BusinessLine spoke to. 
Harit Shah, Research Analyst, Reliance Securities, believes that all the IT exporters’ US dollar revenue is likely to be adversely affected owing to the strengthening of the dollar against major cross-currencies including the euro, the British pound and the Australian dollar. 
This is bound to impact the margins of all IT companies. For Infosys, EBIT margin is expected to decline by 90 basis points (0.9 per cent) due to wage hikes and currency fluctuations, according to Shah. In effect, EBIT margin guidance is expected to be in the range of 22-24 per cent, lesser than TCS’ 25 per cent.
As Infosys battles this transition, visa-related issues have have shown no signs of abatement for the $167-billion Indian IT sector. Most companies have resorted to employing ‘locals’, in addition to automation and partnerships with start-ups to service their clients. 
Digital revenue
For Infosys, digital revenue is 25 per cent of its total revenues and while it is still not margin accretive, the fact that it is grabbing mindshare of non-CIOs within an organisation seems to be positive. 
Infosys has guided for a 7-9 per cent revenue growth rate for FY19, in line with Nasscom’s annual projection. 
In the last three months, S&P BSE IT index has outperformed Sensex and has gained 12.9 per cent, compared to 5.9 per cent returns by Sensex."
216,2018-07-12,Infosys,"Will Infy Q1 emulate TCS’ good show?
After the stellar performance by TCS, all eyes are on Infosys, which is scheduled to declare the June quarter results on Friday. Analysts expect EBIT margin to decline 100 bps due to wage revision and higher visa costs. However, most analysts believe the software major will maintain revenue growth guidance at 6-8 per cent in constant currency for FY19, with a better deal flow outlook. Brokerages expect net profit to grow 1-3 per cent sequentially and 6-9 per cent year-on-year."

The country’s second-largest software services major, Infosys, has reported 3.7 per cent growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 3,612 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared to a net profit of Rs 3,483 crore in the year-ago period.
Revenue from operations of the Bengaluru-based firm grew 12 per cent to Rs 19,128 crore in the April-June quarter compared with Rs 17,078 crore in the year-ago period, Infosys said in a BSE filing today.
Infosys board has approved issuance of one free share for every share held (that is a 1:1 bonus issue).
“The board in its meeting...has considered, approved and recommended a bonus issue of one equity share for every equity share held and a stock dividend of one American Depositary Share (ADS) for every ADS held, as on a record date to be determined,” the company said in the regulatory filing.
Infosys has maintained revenue growth outlook at 6-8 per cent in constant currency terms for fiscal 2019. It had also maintained FY 2018-19 operating margin guidance in the range of 22-24 per cent.
“The strong revenue and margin performance in this quarter shows that our dual emphasis on agile digital and AI (artificial intelligence) driven core services is resonating with our clients,'' Salil Parekh, CEO and MD of the company, said.
He added that the company sees “good traction in the market”.
The results were announced after the market hours. Infosys shares closed 1.12 per cent higher at Rs 1,309.1 apiece on BSE.
The company had said in April that it will pay up to Rs 13,000 crore to shareholders, including Rs 2,600 crore, through special dividend, as the company looked to meet shareholder demands for higher returns.
Infosys had also said that it will continue with its policy of returning up to 70 per cent of its free cash.
Infosys’ scorecard came just days after India’s largest software exporter, TCS, posting a 23.4 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 7,340 crore for the June quarter, delivering what analysts said were street-beating results.
The Tata Group company saw its income from operations growing at 15.8 per cent to Rs 34,261 crore for the first three months of the current financial year, registering a strong growth on all counts."

The ghost of the Panaya acquisition continues to haunt Infosys, clearly affecting its profitability for the June quarter, though there was some cheer for the shareholders with the IT major announcing a 1:1 bonus.
India’s second-largest software exporter recorded a ₹270-crore fall in the fair value of Panaya. This resulted in a 2.1 per cent reduction in net profit to ₹3,612 crore on a sequential basis, with a consequent decrease in basic earnings per equity share by $0.02.
On a year-on-year basis, however, the net profit grew 3.7 per cent.
Infosys retained its annual revenue guidance of 6-8 per cent, in spite of the rupee depreciating 5 per cent. Revenue for the quarter came in at ₹19,128 crore, registering a 12 per cent year-on-year increase, and a 5.8 per cent sequential growth.
EBIDTA for the quarter stood at ₹4,703 crore, registering a 3.1 per cent yearly growth, but declined by 2.3 per cent on a sequential basis due to wage hikes and sales-related investments. Revenue for the quarter was led by growth in retail (up 6.4 per cent Q-o-Q), and energy verticals (up 5.3 per cent).
Not fast enough
The company’s momentum on digital revenues continued steadily, but is not growing fast enough, according to analysts. During the quarter, the digital revenue stood at $803 million or 28.4 per cent of total revenues, a sequential growth of 8 per cent and year-on-year growth of 25.6 per cent in constant currency terms.




 
In comparison, TCS’ digital revenues grew 44 per cent on a yearly basis. There was some concern with respect to financial services’ revenues as the company had placed big bets on its growth; however, on a sequential basis, it reported a decline to 32.6 per cent from 31.8 per cent and from 33 per cent on a year on year basis.
“Right now, they are meeting customer expectations but not exceeding them,” said DD Mishra, Principal Analyst, Gartner. Overall, the numbers were in line with analysts’ expectations. “Infosys has done well but has not been beating the street expectations, which are reasonable,” said Urmil Shah, research analyst, IDBI Capital.
Both attrition and new additions increased, which is a cause for worry as higher attrition usually results in a thinner buffer. The number of employees rose to 2,09,905, up from 2,04,107, and attrition grew to 23 per cent from 19.5 per cent on a sequential basis.
During the quarter, Infosys added four clients in the $100-million category, taking the number of clients in this category to 24."
213,2018-07-15,Infosys,"Infosys to create new return form for GST Council
The GSTN Group of Ministers (GoM) has asked Infosys to create a new tax return filing form in an effort to simplify I-T returns for businesses.
Addressing newspersons at the ninth GSTN GoM meeting, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said taxpayers who file 37 returns a year will file just 13 returns when the new format comes into vogue. “It will be a single-page return form and will be approved by the GST Council in the next few days,” he added.
The efforts to simplify the filing of GST returns is seen as a practical approach in the face of mounting criticism over the complexity and time that businesses have to spend on compliance. Further, filing of returns would be done in a staggered manner between the 10th and 20th of each succeeding month, said Sushil Modi. Many businesses found this complex and tedious, and made representations to the government to simplify the tax filing.
“Reporting and maintenance of accounts were a challenge, but this is a good step,” said Ambar Kasliwal, co-founder, BigWin Infotech.
Infosys has been awarded the ₹1,380-crore contract to develop and run GST’s backend system, which initially met with several tech-related glitches.
There were additional issues with regard to taxation of several items, which subsequently the government revised (for 200 items). Businesses had also complained about the non-user friendly software through which they had to file returns. “The complexity and ambiguity will be removed, coupled with the time and effort to file would reduce which are positives,” said Bhavik Mehta, founder, FinREQ, a fintech start-up.
Additionally, according to Krupesh Bhatt, co-founder, LegalDesk, the simplification of forms will help in reducing errors and reduce the time to fix complex tax filings.
Further, Infosys has also developed a software which can help in identifying large number of tax defaulters while filing GSTR1 and GSTR3B. Sushil Modi said the reports generated by the analytics software will be sent to State governments to take action against defaulters.
So far, the number of returns filed was 12.48 crore and number of payment transactions stands at Rs 4.26 crore, Modi said. In June, GST revenue mop-up rose to ₹95,610 crore when compared to ₹94,016 crore in the previous month,according to Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia.
Despite the initial glitches, Modi said that collectively they have addressed the problem and Infosys' performance has been good. However, a few months back, the issues with GSTN glitches came to a head when trader's body CAIT said that the GST portal has brought much harassment and mental agony to traders by its non-smooth functioning and has proved a major roadblock in success of a good taxation system (like GST). The body then had said that will contemplate taking the software major to court if issues are not resolved. Infosys has already denied the allegations as “completely inaccurate”."

While big IT companies have plenty of openings, they still have only a small percentage (of the total jobs) involved in cutting-edge tech, he said. Currently, the top 3 together employ around 8 lakh.
“For technologies like Java, or roles like application maintenance or software testing, people prefer to go to software exporters. On the other hand, for roles such as Data Scientists or Artificial Intelligence (AI), they flock to new-age companies,” said Amandeep Kaur, Founder, Phoenix TalentX Branding, an employer branding company. Others share Peter Drucker’s saying that culture eats strategy for breakfast.
Culture matters
According to Neha Bagaria, Founder and CEO, JobsForHer, an online portal that connects women looking to restart their careers, “Culture matters a lot, and these companies, given their size, have a hierarchy, and people get pigeon-holed in a job role.”
Additionally, new-age companies pay salaries that are at par with software exporters. Typically, entry-level employees get ₹15,000-20,000 per month. “Many a time, start-ups match these salaries and offer additional incentives such as stock options so they can have skin in the game,” added Bagaria.
This also reflects a change in the psyche of job-seekers: in the past, they were more fixated on a brand name, in addition to pressures from the family to work in a ‘stable’ company. Job-seekers are more open to failures, and the stigma associated with failures is fading away, said Kaur.
Some in the industry believe that there will be a mix of new age companies and mature organizations on a job seeker’s radar. While culture, work-life balance, social consciousness are some factors that have moved up the priority list, especially for the younger generation - brand and growth opportunities still remain high on the list for many, said Arjun Pratap, Founder and CEO, EdGE Networks."

Infosys has filed its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended March 31, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a few days after a whistleblower had raised concerns about poor corporate governance practices.
The financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 20-F have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by International Accounting Standards Board.
Infosys had filed the Indian Annual Report with the Indian Stock Exchanges (BSE/NSE) on May 21, 2018, the company said in a statement."
208,2018-07-20,Infosys,"All things equal, how did TCS hurtle past Infosys?
Retail shareholders in India generally sing paeans of their companies at AGMs. However, over the past three years, some Infosys shareholders have been persistently questioning the company’s continued lacklustre performance, drawing comparisons with TCS.
This year was not any different. Shareholders did question India’s second largest software exporter, asking why TCS is sprinting far ahead while Infosys is lagging.
The numbers tell a big part of the story. TCS started off FY19 on a strong note, with the June quarter earnings beating analysts’ expectations. Infosys, on the other hand, sputtered and performed just in line with analyst estimates.
What changed
In 2009, Infosys’ market capitalisation was 1.5 times bigger than TCS’. Less than a decade since, TCS (at $100 billion) is 2.6 times larger than Infosys ($41.72 billion).
So, all things being equal — the shifts in technology, old business getting redundant and strict curbs on US visas — how has TCS managed to stay ahead in the race?
“TCS has done the best job of understanding how to build and leverage organisational assets to compete. Customers around the world perceive and experience it as being a very strong company,” said Peter Schumacher, CEO at Value Leadership Group, an offshoring expert.
Breaking it down, TCS laid its bets on technologies like big data, AI and mobility for enterprises across all industries much ahead of Infosys, which has made some unconvincing attempts branching out (for example, the Panaya acquisition). “You have to see the storm before it comes and that is what good CEOs do,” said the CEO of a large multinational captive in India which does business with TCS.
Internal problems
The gap between TCS and Infosys was further accentuated due to internal problems plaguing the latter in the last four years — from a confusing shift in strategy to a public spat between the co-founders and former board members.
Contrast this with TCS, which, in the seven years under N Chandrasekaran leadership, turned into an industry bellwether. Its revenue grew almost four-fold, from ₹30,029 crore in FY10 to ₹117,966 crore in FY17, representing a CAGR of 21.6 per cent.
However, before comparing them, it is important to first note the fundamental cultural differences between the two organisations. TCS has always been a larger and more stable company with a stronger focus on governance enabled by a somewhat more conservative risk appetite.
“Over time it has innovated, taken calculated risks such as the major investments in global delivery centres made in South America, ventures in Japan and even some acquisitions (French IT services firm ALTI),” said Sanjoy Sen, Doctoral Research Scholar, Aston Business School.
It didn’t help that the technology industry itself has turned on its head, making the business model of bodyshopping increasingly inconsequential.
TCS, meanwhile, has continued its march over Infosys. Areas such as digital, where client spends are moving up, have raked in around ₹26,000 crore for TCS, against ₹18,000 crore for Infosys.
Leadership change
Even after Chandrasekaran, in an unexpected move, left TCS in early 2017 to take over the reins of Tata Sons, the company has continued to perform well, now under CEO Rajesh Gopinathan (refer table). “Now it is not about getting the work done at the lowest cost, but about hand-holding clients and telling them how their businesses can thrive,” said Rohit Turkhud, Partner, Fakhoury Global Immigration.
Based on Value Leadership’s recent discussions with leading CIOs in Europe, TCS is perceived as being the best firm by far. Infosys is playing in the second league and corporate decision makers expect it will continue to lag.
Collaborative culture
“They (TCS) have done the best job creating an open, collaborative, learning culture. In contrast to Infosys, customers recognise that TCS has a track record of transforming successfully and building organisational capabilities internally,” said Schumacher of Value Leadership.
Though the financial services sector is among TCS’ largest success stories, it has slowly but surely developed a wider and more balanced client portfolio. For instance, it has developed business in the aerospace and automotive sectors, and collaborates with sister companies like Tata Technologies.
Infosys probably started with a similar culture in its early days, albeit smaller in size and more hungry. However, multiple changes in leadership and related governance challenges, together with large-scale infusion of senior executives with a quick-win mindset, have impacted the company, said Sen of Aston Business School."

Near-term resistance ahead for SBI (₹260.9)
SBI fell initially last week, but managed to claw-back later. The stock tumbled about 3 per cent to make a low of ₹250.3 and reversed sharply higher, recovering all the loss. Near-term resistance is in the ₹263-265 zone. If the stock manages to breach ₹265 decisively, it can move up to ₹270 or ₹272 initially. Further break above ₹272 will turn the outlook positive. It will then pave the way for the next targets of ₹280 and ₹285. But inability to break above the ₹270-272 resistance zone can trigger a pull-back move to ₹263 or ₹260. The region between ₹257 and ₹255 is a crucial support to watch. SBI will come under pressure if it declines below ₹255 decisively. In such a scenario, the possibility will increase of the stock tumbling towards ₹240 or even ₹234 thereafter. Short-term traders with high-risk appetite can go short on a break below ₹255. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹263 for the target of ₹243. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹253 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹249.
Short-term outlook positive for ITC (₹270.4)
The support in the ₹267-₹266 region, as expected, limited the downside for ITC. The stock made a low of ₹266.2 and bounced back from those levels, recovering all the loss, and closed 1.1 per cent higher for the week. This retains the positive bias. The indicators on the chart are also positive. The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 200-day moving average and is on the verge of crossing over the 100-day moving average. This is a positive sign, indicating that the downside could be limited in the coming days. Resistance lies between ₹277 and ₹278, which is likely to be tested. A strong break above ₹278 will boost the momentum. Such a break can take ITC higher to ₹285 and ₹287. On the other hand, if the stock fails to break above ₹278, a pull-back move to ₹273 or ₹270 is possible. In such a scenario, the stock may remain range-bound between ₹267 and ₹277 for some time. The bias will, however, remain positive. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220.
Bullish outlook intact for Infosys (₹1,348.3)
Infosys surged 3 per cent last week. The 21-day moving average at ₹1,306 continues to provide strong support. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if the stock declines decisively below the 21-day moving average. The next targets are ₹1,250 and ₹1,235. But such a fall looks less probable as the price action on the weekly chart last week indicates that Infosys is finding fresh buying interest around the psychological ₹1,300 mark. The stock retains its bullish outlook. There is also high probability of it sustaining above its the 21-day moving average support in the coming days. Immediate resistances are at ₹1,360 and ₹1,380. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹1,380 will pave the way for long-term targets of ₹1,450 and ₹1,475 levels. The ₹1,450-1,475 zone is a crucial long-term resistance region. Investors holding long positions should look to book some profits at these levels. Both medium- and long-term investors can book partial profits at ₹1,450.
RIL hovers below a key resistance (₹1,128.5)
RIL extended its rally for the second consecutive week and was up about 3 per cent. The stock has skyrocketed over 15 per cent over the last couple of weeks. A key resistance is near the current levels of ₹1,140-1,150, which is likely to be tested in the near term. Whether RIL breaks above ₹1,150 or not will decide the next move. A strong break above ₹1,150 will take the stock higher to ₹1,180. Further break above ₹1,180 will see the rally extending to ₹1,200 or even higher. On the other hand, if RIL fails to breach ₹1,150 in the coming days, it can come under pressure. In such a scenario, the possibility is high of the stock reversing lower on the back of profit-booking. A pull-back from the ₹1,140-1,150 resistance region can trigger a corrective fall to ₹1,060 or even ₹1,035 over the short term. The levels of ₹1,060 and ₹1,035 are key short-term supports that are likely to limit the downside. A fall below ₹1,035 looks less probable at the moment as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at lower levels.
Downtrend is intact for Tata Steel (₹503.4)
Tata Steel plummeted 10 per cent last week. The sharp fall in the past week has dragged the stock well below the crucial support level of ₹540. Cluster of resistances between ₹530 and ₹550 can cap the upside as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels. A fall to ₹475 or ₹470 is likely in the coming days. Short-term traders can wait for a bounce back and go short at ₹525 and ₹540. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹560 for the target of ₹475. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹510 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹495. The region between ₹475 and ₹470 is a crucial support for Tata Steel. The 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level and a long-term trendline supports are poised between this region. A rally from this support zone can trigger a relief rally to ₹530 and ₹550. But a break below ₹470 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹425 or even ₹400 thereafter. As such, the price action around the ₹475-470 support zone will need a close watch."

 IT major Infosys has decided not to completely sever ties with Panaya and Skava, the two companies it has put on the block. It is instead open to selling the licences of their products.
The acquisition of Panaya in 2015 had resulted in a major crisis at Infosys after a whistle-blower raised concerns over the lack of transparency in the deal. The acquisition was initiated by Infosys’ then CEO and MD, Vishal Sikka. The controversy over the deal finally led to his exit in 2017.
‘Nothing wrong’
Infosys’ Chief Operating Officer UB Pravin Rao told BusinessLine that there was nothing wrong with the acquisitions of both Panaya and Skava, and that they were not bad products. “...but now the realisation is that there are other strategic priorities ... much more in line with our DNA. So, we can continue to leverage them in a different form, rather than from an ownership perspective.” 
He said Infosys had realised that it was not necessary to own the two companies, but that they could be licensed.
As on March 31, 2018, the fair value of Panaya was assessed at $130 million. In 2015, Panaya was bought for $200 million, and another $230 million was invested in the company as part of the acquisition cost. 
The final sale price for Panaya is expected to be lower than the recorded fair value as of March 31, 2018, the filing said."

Infosys is slowly returning to normalcy after going through a rather turbulent phase during the last few years. Analysts, however, say it will take some time before it starts performing to its potential. In an interview with BusinessLine, the company’s Chief Operating Officer Pravin Rao UB shares the management’s vision for the future. 
How do you analyse the performance of Infosys, two quarters after the new CEO took over?
From a client’s perspective, a lot of things have matured. It is reflected in slightly better growth for the industry. Last few years, there was a focus on cost takeout on one side of the business and we were not ready to invest in new areas at the same pace. Now that is changing. In the last year and beginning of this year, projects are maturing and moving from pilot to mainstream. The industry itself will grow faster and there is enough runway for it to grow further (currently $155 billion) in the next 5-10 years.
Do you think the industry itself has changed over the past few years? 
Overall, these are interesting times in the industry with a lot of disruptions, new business and operating models. It is a great opportunity but the Indian industry needs to reinvent itself. The next few years will be much more radical than the past. So, re-skilling is a big thing for the industry with new technologies and services that will drive the future. We have changed training methodologies and provided options such as allowing an employee to access it anytime, anywhere, online or offline.
Some analysts have said that Infosys is just getting its act together when it should actually be accelerating...
We have still some engines which are not firing. Issues were there with our consulting business. Now that is improving and it will take some more time to do so. Digital is firing well with 28 per cent of our revenues coming from that segment. In the last two quarters, we have articulated what digital means to all our stakeholders.
After Salil Parekh took over as CEO, he unveiled a new strategy for the company. Was that done to make a clean break from the past? 
See, the strategy is evolutionary. I would not call it a radically different strategy but a continuation of what we do. Some course corrections were made and tweaks done to identify the path for the next 2-3 years. There was a perception created that we were not doing much work on digital. If you see the 28 per cent revenues coming from digital, it did not happen overnight. In the new thinking, we decided that Panaya and Skava (two companies which were acquired during Sikka’s time) were not strategic for us. It is not that they are bad products. We decided that we do not need to own those products to drive our digital push. We intend to sell licences of Panaya and Skava. Even in the last quarter, we did so. On the other hand, we have said that Finacle and Nia continue to be strategic for us. It is a subtle shift in the strategic direction and not a radical one.
So, when Panaya was acquired, was there less visibility about how it might eventually pan out for the company? 
There was a lot more expectations on leveraging Panaya software for our enterprise clients. But with the migration to cloud, there was a slowdown where people were focussing on newer tech. What we expected in the beginning and the roadmap for the future was not in alignment. It is more about strategic thinking. We don’t have to own it. We can continue to licence it. Even if our competition is using it, it should not make too much of a difference. Skava, on the other hand, helped us in our digital footprint. It was used in mobility and space and now in the last three years it has morphed into a full-fledged e-commerce platform and competes with the likes of Hybris (a subsidiary of SAP) and others. 
It was right at that time of acquisition but now there are other strategic priorities. There was nothing wrong with the product or the strategy at that time. But now the realisation is that there are other strategic priorities where we need to focus on and which are much more in line with our DNA. So we can continue to leverage them in a different form rather than from an ownership perspective. 
 Instead of selling the companies at a discount, wouldn’t it have been better to keep them? Are there any bidders for Panaya? 
Finally, it is the market which determines the value. We felt that instead of making continuous investments and there has to be x amount of management bandwidth we have to devote to and therefore, it was better to not own it. There have been some conversations with certain people regarding its sale and we will announce it when they get finalised. 
 One can see that the gap between the leader of the pack and Infosys is growing wider. What do you attribute that to? 
Five or six years back, there were two leaders and then the rest of us were fairly well behind. Since then, I think we did remarkably well. About two, three years back, we were number one or two growing at 12-13 per cent. But with the beginning of the year, our competitor has grown dramatically. It is only in the recent past, the gap has widened. It is a cycle and they have executed their strategy well. So, we have to focus on our strengths and grow from there. 
You have been with the company for a long time. How did you feel when the company went through a lot of turbulence?
I joined the company when there were less than 50 people, which were about 32 years ago. I don’t think I would have even dreamed of the growth the company ended up having and the position it has attained. I am really proud of being part of an iconic brand and being part of this journey. 
What we have experienced during the last few years is the evolution of a company which is transiting to the next stage. We are moving to a new set of leadership and it takes time to settle down. 
It is the resilience of the organisation that it has managed to withstand all the noise and distractions.
 Something which could have been avoided?
I would rather attribute it to learning. It is a growing organisation and you learn...and hopefully, we will be growing to be a hundred-year-old company. We have just completed one-third of the journey. 
Hopefully, we won’t make the same mistakes again. Today, we have the ability to take more risks, some will work and some won’t. I think the big takeaway is that the organisation has been resilient and one should give credit to those who built this company to such an extent that it has been able to withstand the shocks and distractions and still has been able to come out of it. We have hardly had any client attritions during those years."
204,2018-08-09,Infosys,"TCS in talks with other software majors to market its automation software
 
India’s largest software exporter TCS has begun working with external organisations to market its automation software Ignio.
When asked if TCS is willing to engage other services companies such as Infosys and Wipro to sell Ignio, Harrick Vin, Vice-President, TCS and Global Head, Digitate, told BusinessLine that the company is already in the process of doing so, although none of the partnerships have fructified yet.
“We already have 10 partners on board which includes Unisys, which has relationships with the US government. So far TCS does not work with the US government. Unisys will help us get that. We are also starting to engage with other large systems integrator like TCS to sell Ignio,” Vin said.
Growing revenues
After TCS launched Ignio, the company said that the division has crossed $31 million in revenues last year, making it one of the fastest growing companies in the segment, growing at 100 per cent year-on year since going live in 2015. About 86 percent of these revenues came from licensing while rest came from services.
The company has over 50 clients using Ignio, with an average contract value of about $550,000 per year.
“We want to become the fastest growing products company to reach $100 million in revenue, Vin added without giving any timelines. “Many of the customers we work with have never been TCS customers. Also, while most of them started on a small scale are taking Ignio to multiple departments within the enterprise.”
Ignio already has over 550 people working for it, including 300 scientists and researchers. Digitate has already filed for over 75 patents. The company said it will continue to invest in the brand and continue to hire.
“We are EBITDA positive. So we don’t have any issues of cash,” Vin said. “We will continue to invest in R&D as well as people.”
Digitate
Digitate is a unit within TCS which houses Ignio. TCS has consciously tried to disassociate itself from Digitate to ensure that Digitate is viewed as a products company and not a services unit within TCS.
“While we (Digitate) have no plans to be an independent company, we have a separate brand identity which we’d like to preserve. Ignio is only our first product. We are working on several other products that’ll come out over a period of time,” Vin said.
In terms of revenue, Ignio is still a small fraction of TCS’ overall digital revenues. But it presents a much bigger opportunity for the tech firm.
According to Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and MD, Tata Consultancy Services, at the time of inception of Ignio, five years ago, the company estimated its potential revenues at $2 billion. That was an estimate when the software was being built only for enterprise infrastructure services delivery. Since then it has expanded its scope to applications and business processes, increasing the overall growth opportunity for Ignio.
“Rapid breakthroughs in digital technologies — such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and automation — are reshaping businesses and fostering creative disruptions. The revenue and customer growth for ignio has been over 100% y-o-y. The success and growth of ignio reaffirms TCS’ Business 4.0 strategy, helping customers leverage technology to innovate and gain a competitive advantage,” said, Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and MD, Tata Consultancy Services.
Ignio competes with a host of automation companies such as BluePrism, AutomationAnywhere and IBM Watson."
203,2018-08-13,Infosys,"Infosys commits to start work on its campus near Kolkata

 IT major Infosys has committed to start work on its software development centre in Kolkata investing around ₹100 crore in the first phase. This will be the IT major’s first facility in West Bengal.
Other major IT companies like TCS, Cognizant and Wipro already have a presence in the State through their own campuses.
Infosys’s software development centre, coming up on a 50-acre plot in Newtown — on the north-eastern fringes of the city — is expected to generate employment for 1,000 engineers initially. 
The first phase of the construction will see the setting up of a 5,25,000 sq ft facility.
“The project will be completed within 15 months from the date of obtaining all statutory clearances,” the company said in a press release.
The announcement comes on a day the West Bengal Chief Minister laid the foundation stone for the ‘Bengal Silicon Valley Hub’ — an area covering 100 acres in Newtown. 
The hub is an attempt to woo the IT industry. Infosys’s campus will be a part of this proposed IT hub.
Infosys, sources said, took possession of the land earlier this year. It has also got the plot registered.
Breaking the deadlock
Incidentally, the decision to allot land to the IT-behemoth was taken in 2010 under the then Left Front government. 
The company had also paid the full amount of ₹75 crore (or ₹1.5 crore an acre) to the authorities. 
However, the project has since then been on the back-burner with Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress – which came to power in 2011 – refusing to grant an ‘SEZ’ (special economic zone) status for the project.
The deadlock was finally broken last year when the State government decided to offer matching fiscal benefits to Infosys, compensating for the denial of the SEZ status. 
A formal announcement on the benefits was later cleared by the Bengal Cabinet, sources said.
Amongst the benefits that the West Bengal government cleared included that 49 per cent of the land will be on lease and used for IT purposes. The remaining 51 per cent will be freehold land and can be used. Previously, the entire land was allotted to the company on a 99-year lease."

Infosys has announced that the board of directors at its meeting on Saturday has accepted the resignation of M.D. Ranganath as the Chief Financial Officer and a key managerial personnel. Ranganath will continue in his current position as Chief Financial Officer till November 16, 2018. The board will immediately commence the search for the next Chief Financial Officer.
In tendering his resignation, Ranganath stated, “After a successful career spanning 18 years in Infosys, including as CFO for the last three crucial years, I now plan to pursue professional opportunities in new areas.”
Commenting further, Ranganath added, “I am grateful to Infosys for giving me the opportunity of serving as CFO of this global iconic company. I am proud that over the last three years, during a critical phase of the company, we delivered strong and consistent financial outcomes, maintained high standards of financial reporting, built a world-class finance team, further strengthened the company’s competitive position and, thereby, enhanced value to the stakeholders. I thank the board, management team, my colleagues in the finance team and all the stakeholders for their wholehearted support during my tenure. I wish the management team all the best as I pursue opportunities outside the company.”
Nandan M Nilekani, Chairman of the Board said, “Over the last 18 years Ranga has played a pivotal role in the growth and success of Infosys. During his long stint in the company, I have seen him in a wide spectrum of leadership roles and in each of them he has delivered results with distinction. With Ranga as CFO, the company has in the last three crucial years, delivered a strong and resilient financial performance on multiple fronts, implemented an efficient capital allocation policy and earned the respect of all stakeholders through enhanced value creation. On behalf of the board, I thank Ranga for his excellent contribution to the company and wish him all the very best in his endeavours.”
Salil Parekh, Chief Executive Officer said, “Ranga and I have worked closely over the past few quarters in shaping the strategic direction of the company. I admire his strong financial acumen, deep understanding of the company’s business and ability to deliver consistent results. He played a crucial role as the CFO and provided strong leadership for the company. I am confident that over the next few months Ranga will ensure a smooth transition. I thank him for his lasting contribution and wish him all the best.”
During his long tenure of 18 years in Infosys, Ranga has been a part of the Infosys leadership team and has played several leadership roles in the areas of consulting, finance, strategy, risk management and M&A and has worked closely with the board and its committees in formulating and executing strategic priorities for the company."

His departure is an irreplaceable loss for Infosys at this critical juncture. I wish him the best in his future endeavours,” said Infosys founder Narayana Murthy, while reacting to Ranganath’s resignation.
“I have worked with Ranga for over 15 years. He is clearly one of the best chief finance officers (CFOs) in the country. His ability to take tough decisions in challenging situations, his solid financial expertise, strong value system, unfailing courtesy and flawless execution have always distinguished him as an exemplary leader and a key asset for the company,” said Murthy.
Murthy further said: “He has been instrumental in raising investor confidence in the company during the last five years by managing costs and margins. He is a rare individual who understands all the important stakeholders - clients, delivery teams, employee aspirations, finance, investors, governance, the law, and the role of an ethical business in building a better society.”"

The shares of IT major Infosys closed 3.2 per cent lower at ₹1,385.20 on Monday on the BSE, reacting to the Saturday decision of its Chief Financial Officer MD Ranganath to step down from the company.
Ranganath, who took over as CFO in October 2015 and spent 18 years in India’s second-largest software exporter, will exit the company on November 16, said Infosys.
Analysts believe that his exit will not make much impact on the company’s performance. “His exit is a loss to the company. And is a negative in the short term. However, the way Infosys has managed the changes at the CEO level and other senior management exits, we are confident that Ranga’s exit will not have any material impact on Infosys’ medium- to long-term performance,” said Urmil Shah, Research Analyst and Associate Vice-President, IDBI Capital.
Ranganath was instrumental in not letting margins slide in a significant manner and analysts consider that in the last three years doing so was an achievement. This, they attribute was due to change in the way outsourcing has changed, in addition to tougher scrutiny on H1-B visas and severe competition for outsourcing projects. Also, Infosys witnessed a bitter spat between its co-founders and Vishal Sikka on corporate governance lapses, which eventually led to the latter resigning. Additionally, there were senior management changes and Infosys’ current CEO Salil Parekh has outlined a new strategy since taking over in January this year.
‘Good margin profile’
“He did play a key role in making sure that Infosys maintained good margin profile and financial performance in the last three years when the company saw multiple senior management changes, but going forward we see this development in line with the new CEO’s objectives,” said Shah.
During Ranganath’s tenure, operating margins came down to 23.7 per cent in the June quarter from 25 per cent.
This is the second CFO-level exit seen in Infosys since 2015 when Rajiv Bansal quit owing to differences with the management over Panaya acquisition and even has a case under arbitration over a part of his severance package.
“The (recen) rally hardly leaves stomach for news of continued rebuilding of the top leadership and the ensuing distraction to business. Hence, we would expect the stock to lose some of the steam that had been built up in the recent past,” said Motilal Oswal which maintained a buy rating with a target price of ₹1,600."

199,2018-08-20,Infosys,"The curious case of Infosys CFO’s resignation
The resignation of Infosys CFO MD Ranganath within three years of his predecessor Rajiv Bansal putting in his papers has caught the IT industry by surprise.
The Infosys board announced on Saturday that the resignation of Ranganath, a veteran, has been accepted. The board put on record its appreciation of his contribution towards the growth and success of Infosys.
“During his long stint in the company, I have seen him in a wide spectrum of leadership roles and in each of them he has delivered results with distinction.
“With Ranga as CFO, the company has, in the last three crucial years, delivered a strong and resilient financial performance on multiple fronts, implemented an efficient capital allocation policy, and earned the respect of all stakeholders through enhanced value creation,” said Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani. Industry sources pointed out that it was quite unusual for a CFO to quit before the board could find a replacement for him.
While the board has said that it will start the search for a person to replace him immediately, clearly it was caught unawares by the development, the sources said.
Sources said colleagues at Infosys expected Ranganath to get a seat on the board as a reward for successfully managing the crisis, along with top executives, when NR Narayana Murthy and others had raised issues about the way the acquisitions of Panaya and Skava were handled.
Murthy had put out a media statement within hours of Ranganath quitting saying he was an outstanding executive.
According to multiple sources BusinessLine spoke to, his colleagues had expected an announcement during the recent AGM about Ranganath’s elevation to the board."

 India’s second largest IT services firm Infosys has hired over 4,700 locals in the US since last year, including nearly 500 people for its technology hub in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Last year, the company had announced that it will hire about 10,000 locals and establish multiple technology and innovation hubs across the US with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), user experience, emerging digital technologies, cloud, and big data. These hubs have been set up in Indiana, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The latest one to open is in Raleigh, North Carolina.
“Infosys announced that it has hired more than 4,700 Americans since Spring 2017, including nearly 500 in North Carolina, as part of the company’s campaign to hire 10,000 Americans and accelerate the pace of innovation for American industry,” the Bengaluru-based firm said in a statement.
The North Carolina Hub will help Infosys work more closely with clients in the region to develop cross-functional solutions to business challenges in areas like ML and AI among others, it added. The Hub will also train, upskill and reskill Infosys and client employees in the technologies required to help American businesses accelerate their digital transformations, the statement said.
Infosys Foundation USA is also providing multiple grants for classroom technology and computer science training to teachers and schools. To date, these grants have reached 3,938 students, 102 teachers and 94 schools across the state, it said.
“Supported by academic institutions in North Carolina and around the country, the Hub allows us to co-locate, co-innovate and co-create alongside our clients and build on our passion for creating the next generation of top US technology talent through world-class education and training,” Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said.
Infosys, like many of its peers, has been ramping local hiring in key markets like the US, the UK and Australia to tackle increasing scrutiny around work visas by various governments. This is also part of Infosys’ three-pronged strategy of focussing on stabilising the company’s business in 2018-19, build momentum the next year, followed by acceleration in 2020-21."

194,2018-09-02,Infosys,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (₹308.8)




 
SBI inched higher in the initial part of the week and then remained range-bound for the rest of the week. The stock closed 2.8 per cent higher for the week. Though the daily candle chart gives a mixed outlook, the weekly chart is bullish. A key near-term resistance is at ₹312. Inability to breach this hurdle and a subsequent fall below ₹303 — the 21-day moving average support — can drag the stock lower to ₹290 in the short term. But the downside is likely to be limited as a break below the ₹290-285 support cluster is unlikely. On the other hand, if SBI manages to break above ₹312, an up-move to ₹320 can be seen. The level of ₹320 is a key short-term resistance. A strong break and a decisive close above this hurdle will boost the momentum. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹350 or even ₹370 over the medium term. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions. Retain the stop-loss at ₹283. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹318.
 
ITC (₹319.1)




 
The uptrend in ITC remains intact and is gaining momentum. The stock surged 2.8 per cent last week and closed at a key resistance level of ₹319. A pull-back in the initial part of the week can take the stock lower to ₹315 or ₹312. But further fall below ₹312 looks unlikely at the moment. The levels of ₹312 and ₹307 are significant supports for ITC, which are likely to limit the downside in the short term. A bounce back from either ₹315 or ₹312 will increase the likelihood of the stock breaking above ₹319 decisively. Such a break can take ITC higher to ₹327 — the next crucial resistance level. As mentioned last week, a strong break above ₹327 will give the stock fresh momentum. In such a scenario, ITC will gear up for a fresh rally to ₹360 over the medium term. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Short-term traders who have taken long positions at ₹297 can hold with a stop-loss at ₹303. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹308 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹321. Book profits at ₹330.
 
 
Infosys (₹1,440)




 
Infosys surged over 4 per cent last week. The 21-day moving average is continuing to provide strong support. This support has been limiting the downside in the stock consistently since April. Immediate resistance is in the ₹1,447-1,450 region. Inability to breach ₹1,450 can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹1,400 or ₹1,390. But a strong break above ₹1,450 can take Infosys higher to ₹1,490 or ₹1,500. The region between ₹1,490 and ₹1,500 is a key resistance. A corrective fall after testing this resistance region cannot be ruled out. Long-term investors can book partial profits at ₹1,480 and keep the stop-loss for the rest of the holdings at ₹1,360. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions, retain the stop-loss at ₹1,360 and book profits at $1,485. The uptrend in Infosys will come under threat only if it declines below the 21-day moving average (₹1,393) support decisively. Such a break will trigger a fall to ₹1,350 . Further break below ₹1,350 can then drag the stock to ₹1,320 or even lower thereafter.
 
 
RIL (₹1,240.9)




 
RIL began the week on a positive note and surged about 4 per cent intra-week to record a high of ₹1,328. However, the stock lost momentum and reversed sharply lower, giving back all the gains made and closed 3 per cent lower for the week. The near-term outlook is negative. Resistance is around ₹1,280. As long as the stock remains below ₹1,280, the possibility of the stock breaking below ₹1,229 — the 21-day moving average — is high. Such a break can take RIL lower to ₹1,210 initially. A strong break below ₹1,210 will turn the outlook to negative. In such a scenario, a sharp fall to ₹1,160 or even lower levels is possible on the back of profit-booking. On the other hand, if RIL manages to reverse higher from the immediate support levels of ₹1,229 or ₹1,210, the downside pressure may ease. A bounce-back move to ₹1,260 or ₹1,270 is possible in that case. A decisive break and close above ₹1,270 will bring back the bullish momentum. It will then increase the possibility of the stock revisiting ₹1,300 and ₹1,320.
 
 
Tata Steel (₹601.6)




 
Tata Steel surged 4.6 per cent last week, recovering all the loss made in the earlier week. With this up-move, the stock has regained its strength. Support is in the ₹593-₹590 region, which is likely to limit the downside in the near term. A break below ₹590 can drag the stock lower to ₹570 or ₹565. But such a fall looks less probable as the indicators on the chart are positive . The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 100-day moving average. This is a bullish signal. Immediate resistance is at ₹619 . The possibilityof the stock breaking above this hurdle is high. Such a break can will see the current uptrend extending to ₹625 and ₹635 levels in the coming days. The region between ₹635 and ₹640 is a crucial resistance. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹640 will confirm that the downtrend that has been in place since January has reversed. As such, the price action around the ₹635-₹640 resistance region will need a close watch to get a cue on the direction of the next move."

The Infosys Mysuru campus has been awarded the LEED EBOM (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design - Existing Building Operation & Maintenance) Platinum certification by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC).
Infosys now has 18.25 million square feet of the highest rated green buildings – of which 16.9 million square feet are LEED Platinum rated and 1.35 million square feet are GRIHA 5-star rated buildings.
The LEED Green Building Rating System is a globally accepted benchmark for design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. Infosys has the largest building area certified as LEED Platinum in the IT office space category. To make its campuses sustainable and resource efficient, Infosys has since 2008 followed a two-pronged strategy to design new buildings to the highest energy efficiency standards and implement deep retrofits in old buildings.
At the Mysuru campus, efficiency improvements were achieved through large-scale retrofit projects in existing buildings, including food courts, training centres, guest houses and sports complexes.
Major interventions included the complete re-engineering of chiller plants, air handling units, building management system (BMS) retrofit, UPS and lighting retrofit. These initiatives have helped Infosys lower its operating costs, enhance equipment life, create healthier indoor air quality, and improve occupant comfort and satisfaction. 
Some of the key features that contributed to this accreditation are:
Water efficiency: The campus was the first to pilot a unique smart irrigation system in 2017 and has also installed smart water meters as well as ground water injection systems to reduce water usage and capture the maximum rainwater. In FY2018 the campus reduced per capita water consumption by 20.6 per cent compared to the previous financial year. The Infosys Mysuru campus is a model for water sustainability due to the various lakes created for rainwater harvesting and demand-side measures to reduce water consumption.
Energy efficiency: The campus has a central command centre for an Integrated Building Management System (IBMS) that helps with remote energy performance management to ensure the efficient operation of buildings. In FY2018 the campus reduced its per capita energy consumption by about 5 per cent compared to FY17.
Waste management: The campus in 2016 became the first to have a fully automated solar-heat assisted greenhouse dryer capable of treating 3.5 tonnes of sewage sludge per day. In addition, the campus has a biogas plant to treat food waste generated in the food courts of the campus.
Renewable Energy: The total installed solar power capacity at the campus is 603 kilowatt (kW), which generates 0.9 million kWh solar power. In FY2018 the campus procured 23.65 million kWh of green power.
Over the years, Infosys has demonstrated leadership in implementing innovative technologies and practices to foster sustainability, leading to high operational efficiency, while minimising the environmental impact."

 Infosys Ltd has lost an arbitration over severance package to its former CFO Rajiv Bansal and has been asked to pay outstanding amount of Rs 12.17 crore, with interest, the firm said Tuesday. “The arbitral tribunal has communicated its decision in the arbitration proceedings in relation to the severance agreement between the company and its former CFO, Mr Rajiv Bansal,” Infosys said in a BSE filing.
As per the award, Infosys is required to pay Bansal the outstanding severance amount of Rs 12.17 crore, with interest, it added. “While the award acknowledges that Infosys had bona fide disputes, its counter claim for refund of previously paid severance amount of Rs 5.2 crore and damages, has been rejected,” the filing said, adding that the arbitral award is confidential.
Infosys said it will take legal advice for further action on the issue. The IT firm had agreed to pay Bansal a severance amount of Rs 17.38 crore or 24 months of salary, but the company suspended payments after he got Rs 5 crore as co-founder N R Narayana Murthy and others objected to the severance package as excessive.
Following this, Bansal had dragged his former employer to arbitration to claim the remaining Rs 12 crore of his severance pay. Bansal’s severance payout has been one of the issues that Infosys founders had raised to allege governance lapses at the Bengaluru-based firm.
When Bansal left Infosys in 2015, Infosys had agreed to pay him Rs 17.38 crore in severance pay, equalling 24 months of pay."

 Infosys will have to pay its former CFO Rajive Bansal the remaining ₹12.17 crore of the severance package it owes him.
In a notification to the exchanges, Infosys said the arbitral tribunal, which went into this issue, added that while Infosys had bona fide disputes with Bansal, its counter-claim for refund of the previously paid severance amount of ₹ 5.2 crore and damages has been rejected. 
Infosys paid Bansal only ₹5.2 crore of the promised exit payout of ₹17.38 crore. Bansal dragged the company to court, and subsequently, in 2017, invoked his right to an arbitral tribunal on the issue of Infosys holding back a substantial portion of his severance pay.
It is understood that the severance pay was halted as co-founder NR Narayana Murthy had said that such a large payout may be viewed by some as “hush money”, and castigated the board for not having made all disclosures with respect to it.
Some proxy advisory firms and other investors, too, raised the issue of high exit payouts, saying they were unprecedented and went against the culture of Infosys. All this happened when Vishal Sikka was CEO, and R Seshasayee the Chairman; both of them resigned a year ago."

“The Arizona Technology and Innovation Hub will have a special focus on autonomous technologies, Internet of Things (IOT), full-stack engineering, data science and cyber security,” Infosys said in a statement.
 Infosys has so far opened two Technology and Innovation Hubs in Indianapolis, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina. Infosys has also announced an additional Technology and Innovation Hub in Hartford, Connecticut and a unique Design and Innovation Hub in Providence, Rhode Island.

Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) is the department of the Canadian government that provides services for federal departments and agencies.
As a part of the deal, Infosys Public Services, a subsidiary of India’s second largest software exporter, will implement the SAP-based solution and set up a network, along with managing it.
Further, Infosys will work with Ernst & Young LLP (EY) and SAP Canada Inc. to digitise PSPC procurement system through the implementation and management of a cloud-based electronic procurement solution. The new platform will enable PSPC to purchase various goods and services through a single portal, easily configure specific requirements, and access data, reporting and analytics information in real-time to support more effective decision-making. 
“Navigating their programmes, services and aligning to a digital future requires organisations to not only identify the right technologies to implement, but also to enable them quickly and at scale,” said Eric Paternoster, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys Public Services.
This deal’s expansion scope will be based on the experience within PSPC, after which the government will determine whether to expand the solution to other federal departments and agencies. Provincial and municipal organisations will later be offered an option to use this platform to streamline their procurement processes and reduce the administrative burden while engaging with around 1.8 lakh government suppliers, Infosys said.
These are efforts taken by Infosys to deepen its roots in the Americas from where it gets around 70 per cent of its revenues. Recently, Infosys announced the opening of a technology and innovation hubs in North Carolina, Arizona, with plans to hire 1,000 workers by 2023. 
Infosys shares closed at ₹717 or 1.5 per cent higher when compared to previous day’s close."

 SBI (₹270) 
SBI plummeted 7 per cent last week breaking below the key support levels of ₹275 and ₹270. The stock made an intra-week low of ₹253.6 and recovered some of the loss before closing the week at ₹270. Near-term resistances are at ₹275 and ₹278. As long as the stock trades below ₹278, the outlook will remain negative and a fall to ₹256 is possible. A bounce from ₹256 can take the stock higher to ₹270 levels again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹256 and ₹278 is possible. But if SBI breaks below ₹256 decisively, it will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹245 or ₹243 in the coming weeks. Traders can go short if SBI reverses lower from the ₹275-278 resistance region. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹291 for the target of ₹245. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹270 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹260. The outlook for the stock will turn positive only on a strong rise past ₹278. In such a scenario, a relief rally to ₹287 and ₹290 is possible.





 ITC (₹303.7) 
ITC managed to stay afloat amid a strong sell-off in the broader markets last week. The stock made a smart recovery after falling about 3 per cent intra-week and closed just 1 per cent lower for the week. This reflects the inherent strength in the stock. It will come under pressure only if it declines below ₹295. The next targets are ₹290 and ₹285. But as long as ITC sustains above ₹295, the broader uptrend will remain intact. Immediate resistances are at ₹307 and ₹309. A strong break above ₹309 will take ITC higher to ₹317 or ₹321 over the short term. Further break above ₹321 will then target ₹327 — the next crucial resistance level. As being reiterated over the last few weeks, a decisive break above ₹327 will boost the momentum and trigger a fresh rally to ₹360 over the medium term. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Traders with a medium-term perspective can make use of dips to go long at ₹298 and ₹293. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹270 for the target of ₹355.





Infosys (₹706.3)
Infosys tumbled 4 per cent last week. The sharp fall over the past week has taken the stock decisively below the 21-day moving average support that has been limiting the downside over the last five months. It also indicates early signs of the uptrend, that has been in place since September 2017, getting reversed. The region between ₹718 and ₹720 is a key resistance, which has to be breached to ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take Infosys higher to ₹740 and ₹750 levels again. But as long as the stock remains below ₹721, there is a strong likelihood of it breaking below the crucial support level of ₹690 in the coming days. Such a break will confirm the trend reversal and drag Infosys to ₹660. Further break below ₹660 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹630 and ₹625. Short-term traders with high-risk appetite can go short on a bounce to ₹710 and ₹717. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹732 for the target of ₹670. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹695 when it moves to ₹685.





 RIL (₹1,216.8) 
 RIL fell, breaking below the key support level of ₹1,225 and closed about 3 per cent lower for the week. A complex head-and-shoulder reversal pattern is visible on the chart. This is a bearish pattern indicating a reversal of the current uptrend .The neckline resistance of this pattern is poised around ₹1,237. Also, another key resistance is at ₹1,253. The outlook will turn positive only if RIL manages to breach ₹1,253. This will see the stock revisiting ₹1,300 and ₹1,320 levels. But as long as the stock trades below ₹1,253, a fall to ₹1,175 or ₹1,170 cannot be ruled out in the short term. A bounce from the ₹1,175-1,170 support zone can trigger a relief rally to ₹1,200 and ₹1,220. But a break below ₹1,170 will increase the likelihood of the stock falling to ₹1,100. Traders with a medium-term perspective can wait for a bounce and go short at ₹1,225 and ₹1,245. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,265 for the target of ₹1,120. Revise the stop-loss to ₹1,205 when the stock moves down to ₹1,190.





 Tata Steel (₹615.3) 
Tata Steel seems to have remained insulated from the broader market sell-off. Though the stock tumbled about 6 per cent intraday on Friday, it managed to recover all the loss and close the week 1.5 per cent higher. Key resistance is at ₹640. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹680 and ₹700 thereafter. But if the sell-off in the broader market intensifies, the upside in this stock could be capped at ₹640. In such a scenario, Tata Steel can remain range-bound between ₹575 and ₹640 for some time. The outlook will turn negative only if Tata Steel declines below ₹575 — the 21-week moving average. Such a break can drag it to ₹550. But the price action on the chart indicates that the stock is likely to sustain above ₹575. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹560. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹620 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹635. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹635 as soon as Tata Steel moves up to ₹655."

SBI (₹265)
SBI was range-bound between ₹261 and ₹274 and closed 1.8 per cent lower for the week. The bias remains negative and any intermediate bounce in the coming days could be short-lived. A strong break below ₹261 — the 200-week moving average — can take the stock lower to ₹255. If SBI manages to bounce from ₹255, a relief rally to ₹270 is possible. But a strong break below ₹255 will increase the downside pressure. Such a break will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling to ₹245 thereafter. On the other hand, if SBI sustains above ₹261, a bounce to ₹275 is possible. The region between ₹275 and ₹277 is a key resistance zone. A strong break above ₹277 is needed to ease the downside pressure. This break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹285 over the short term. Traders with a high-risk appetite can go short on rallies at ₹273 and ₹276. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹291 for a target of ₹245. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹267 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹259.





ITC (₹296.7)
ITC shares fell 2.3 per cent and were down for the fourth consecutive week. Clusters of moving average and trendline supports are poised in the ₹290-₹280 region, which is holding well for now. ITC made a low of ₹289.5 last week and bounced from there. If the stock sustains above ₹290, an up-move to ₹305 and ₹307 is possible. A strong break above ₹307 will take the stock up to ₹317 or even ₹321 over the short term. It will confirm the end of the corrective fall that has been in place since early September. But if ITC reverses lower from the ₹305-307 resistance region, it can fall back to ₹295 and ₹290 levels again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹290 and ₹307 is possible for some time. A break below ₹290 can take ITC lower to ₹285 and ₹280. Investors can hold their long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Medium-term traders who took long positions last week on dips at ₹298 and ₹293 can hold them. Retain the stop-loss at ₹270 for a target of ₹355.





Infosys (₹727.8)
Infosys surged 3 per cent last week, recovering most of the loss made in the week earlier. The sharp bounce in the past week has triggered the stop-loss on the short positions recommended last week. The price action over the past two weeks leaves the immediate outlook unclear for the stock. Key support is at ₹690 and resistance is in between ₹740 and ₹750. Infosys can remain in a broad sideways range between ₹690 and ₹750. A breakout on either side of ₹690 or ₹750 will then decide the next move. A strong break above ₹750 can take the stock higher to ₹757 initially. A break above ₹757 will then take the stock fhigher to ₹770 thereafter. On the other hand, if the Infosys stock breaks below ₹690, it can come under selling pressure. This break will drag the stock lower to ₹660 on the back of profit-booking. It will also confirm that the uptrend since August 2017 has reversed. Further break below ₹660 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹630 and ₹625





RIL (₹1,258.2)
Contrary to expectations, RIL surged over 3 per cent last week. The short positions recommended last week have been stopped out on the strong bounce-back move witnessed last week. The head and shoulder reversal pattern mentioned last week has got negated. A key support is at ₹1,242. As long as the stock remains above this support, an up-move to ₹1,280 is possible. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,280 will boost the momentum. Such a break will then pave way for a fresh rally to ₹1,350 or even higher levels. The bullish outlook will get negated if RIL declines below ₹1,242 decisively. Such a break can drag the stock lower to ₹1,200 or ₹1,195 in the near term. Further break below ₹1,195 will then increase the likelihood of the downmove extending to ₹1,185 or ₹1,180. The level of ₹1,180 is a crucial long-term trend-line support for the stock. The uptrend that has been in place since the beginning of this year will come under threat if RIL declines below ₹1,180.





Tata Steel (₹580.35)
Tata Steel tumbled over 7 per cent last week. The stock is poised above a crucial support level of ₹575. Whether Tata Steel bounces from this support or not will determine the next move. A bounce from ₹575 will ease the downside pressure. In such a scenario, an up-move to ₹605 or ₹615 can be seen in the near term. An inability to breach ₹615 levels can drag the stock to ₹590. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹575 and ₹615 can be seen. But if Tata Steel manages to breach ₹615, it can extend its rally to ₹637 and ₹640 thereafter. On the other hand, if Tata Steel breaks below ₹575, it can fall to ₹559. Further break below ₹559 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹540 or ₹535 thereafter. Medium-term traders can retain their long positions. Keep the stop-loss at ₹560. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹605 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹613. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹615 as soon as Tata Steel goes up to ₹630."

 As Infosys looks to announce second quarterly numbers, the market expects the software services major to maintain its revenue guidance in constant currency and raise its margin guidance for the remaining quarters.
This comes in the backdrop of the quarter, being a seasonally strong one for the IT industry, withoutsourcing projects are bagged. There is also the tailwind from a depreciating rupee.
At the beginning of 2018-19 financial year, Infosys gave a guidance of 6-8 per cent for the year. Industry body Nasscom has projected a 7-9 per cent growth for the industry. 
Analysts that BusinessLine spoke to said that India’s second largest software exporter is expected to clock $2.9 billion revenues, a 2.7 per cent increase on a sequential basis and a 6.5 per cent increase year-on-year. However, it is the annual guidance and a higher margin projection that analysts are looking forward to. A Sharekhan report said that it expects Infosys to maintain revenue guidance.
Infosys had said in beginning of the year that its expects EBIT margins for the fiscal to be in the range of 22-24 per cent, lower than TCS’ margins which came in at 26.5 per cent. 
Urmil Shah, Research Analyst- Institutional Equities, IDBI Capital, said “We expect upward revision in guidance to the tune of 100 basis points (1 per cent) due to rupee depreciation which will be offset the 100 basis points investments that the company has outlined for its growth.”. 
Infosys’ performance also needs to be seen in the backdrop of its CFO MD Ranganath resigning in August.
A Motilal Oswal IT analyst said, the seasonal strength, coupled with the benefits from a favourable currency, is likely to drive a continued recovery for the technology sector. The analyst expects Infosys to raise its margin guidance by 50 basis points (0.5 per cent) considering the depreciating rupee.
TCS, which kicked off the earnings a few days back, delivered a steady performance helped by revenues from retail sector and banking, financial services and insurance clients but faced some EBIT margin pressures.
Analysts are also keeping an eye on Infosys management commentary regarding deal win ramp ups. 
Abhishek Shindadkar IT Analyst with Equirus stated that TCS leads by a mile in terms of (client) account management.-”The $50 million+ client additions are higher than Infosys, Wipro and HCL put together,” he said. While additions in $ 1-20 million bucket were twice that of Infosys.
“Transition to $50 million+ clients have been tepid,” added Shindadkar."

Infosys reported 13.8 per cent growth in second quarter and consolidated profit at Rs 4,110 crore, on a sequential basis.
Revenues for India’s second largest software exporter grew by 7.7 per cent to Rs 20,609 crore compared to Rs 19,128 crore in previous quarter. 
Infosys also retained its annual growth guidance of 6-8 per cent, in line with analyst expectations.

172,2018-10-16,Infosys,"‘Infosys will sustain recruitment momentum’
In what could bring cheer to campus graduates, Infosys said that it will continue to hire in the upcoming quarters.
“We expect to see an uptick in demand and in line with that, see a good momentum in hiring,” replied UB Pravin Rao, COO, Infosys, when asked by BusinessLine.
This sentiment coming in the backdrop of TCS stating a few days back that it will hire 28,000 engineering graduates this fiscal, a first in the last three years is bound to uplift the mood among graduates.
The country’s second largest software exporter, however, did not specify how many graduates it plans to hire. In the second quarter of 2019 fiscal, Infosys added around 7,800 employees and in the June-ended quarter 5,798. “It reiterates the 'beginning of the end' of the lack of optimism about Indian IT companies’ future.
While Infosys has announced its intention to hire from campuses, it has seen a high level of attrition over the past three quarters. For example, attrition in the second quarter was 22.2 per cent and in the first quarter 23 per cent. Infosys closed 2018 financial year with 2,04,107 employees, adding 3,800 employees for the whole year when compared to the previous year.
The Indian IT sector over the past few years has significantly reduced campus hires due to a combination of factors. As growth slowed down, projects reduced and clients started to focus more on ‘Digital’ for which new skillsets were needed.
Recently, LinkedIn in its workforce report pointed out that jobs requiring digital skills fuelled employment growth in the first half of 2018. Another of its report stated jobs such as Machine Learning Engineer, Application Development Analyst, Back End Developer, Full Stack Engineer, Data Scientist, Customer Success Manager, Digital Marketing Specialist, Big Data Developer, Sales Recruiter and Python Developer were most sought after.
The demand for Machine Learning Engineers has grown 43 times between 2013- 2017 and that of Application Development Analyst32 times."

Infosys managed to match TCS in revenue growth and also in terms of recording significant traction in key verticals such as financial services and retail in the seasonally strong second quarter of the current fiscal.
But in several important parameters such as operating margin, attrition, and addition of large-sized clients, Infosys has fallen behind TCS. Looked at in isolation, however, the quarter’s performance may be deemed satisfactory for Infosys, coming as it does after a reasonable June period.
In the September quarter, Infosys’ revenues increased by 3.2 per cent sequentially in dollar terms (4.2 per cent in constant currency), while net profits rose by 8.8 per cent. TCS’ revenue growth too was 3.2 per cent.
The operating margin, despite significant depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, remained stable at 23.7 per cent. TCS, on the other hand, recorded a nearly 150 basis improvement and reported operating margins of 26.5 per cent.
Key verticals deliver
For Infosys, revenues from large segments such as financial services, retail and manufacturing grew by 3.7-4.9 per cent sequentially in the September period; TCS too recorded broad-based growth in many verticals.
Revenues from digital offerings grew by a healthy 12.7 per cent during the quarter for Infosys, and now account for 31 per cent of the overall pie. TCS’ digital business grew by a stronger 16.5 per cent. In terms of large-sized client additions, Infosys has lagged TCS significantly. Infosys witnessed a decline of one client in the $100 million bucket, while TCS had four additions in the category. The number of $10 million clients increased by 10 for TCS, while for Infosys the count rose by five. Attrition, at 22.2 per cent, continues to be a concern for Infosys, versus just 10.9 per cent for TCS.
On the revival path
From an IT industry standpoint, the healthy dollar revenue growth recorded by the top two players indicates that the software services space is set on the path of a broadbased revival.
Infosys has reiterated its guidance of 6-8 per cent revenue growth for FY19 and may finish closer to the upper end of the band, while TCS is likely to record double-digit growth.
Thus, the premium valuation multiples accorded to TCS (26 times trailing earnings) vis-à-vis Infosys (19 times) is not likely to go away any time soon."

Infosys (Buy)
CMP: ₹704.5
Target: ₹800
In our recent report on Infosys, we had cited the gestation that one should expect for the company’s revenue-margin duality, given the ongoing investments and the high attrition rate.
2QFY19 performance was a case in point, with CC revenue growth of 4.2 per cent q-o-q (8.1 per cent y-o-y) exceeding our estimate of 3.5 per cent and EBIT margin of 23.7 per cent (flat q-o-q despite currency tailwinds) missing our estimate by 40 bp. PAT of ₹4,100 crore grew 5.9 per cent q-o-q (1.8 per cent q-o-q excluding 1QFY19’s one-off provision), marginally below our estimate of +6.9 per cent q-o-q, primarily due to lower margin.
For FY19/20, we upgrade our revenue estimate marginally by 0.4 per cent/0.7 per cent and lower our EBIT margin estimate by 60 bp/85 bp. The offset implies unchanged FY20 EPS of ₹43.
Infosys trades at 16x FY20E earnings, still at a meaningful discount to TCS. Visibility on revenue growth lent by 2Q execution and deal wins makes a case for some convergence, though the respective executions on margins will continue to warrant a gap. Our TP of ₹800 discounts forward earnings by 17x."

Citi believes 2018 will be marginally better than 2017 for Indian IT. The brokerage prefers Infosys over TCS given better visibility post Q2. Macquarie has raised the price target to Rs 775, and has retained “outperform” rating. But it says Infosys still remains a work in progress, and, hence, 20 per cent valuation discount to TCS is warranted.
Jefferies has raised the price target on US-listed stock to $11.40 from $11, and has given “buy” rating. EBIT margin of 23.7 per cent was 80bps below estimate and investments are likely to accelerate in H2 vs H1 suggesting further margin pressure at least in the near-term.

169,2018-10-17,Infosys,"IT firms’ buybacks hamper their future biz investment: Moody’s
 Share buybacks by information technology (IT) firms in the country impede their ability to invest for their future business needs, global ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service said on Wednesday.
It can be noted that the last few years have seen a high number of share buybacks from the country’s cash-rich IT companies.
“High levels of cash outflows to shareholders are reducing the ability of Indian IT services companies to respond to business demands, including acquisition of new technology, as well as research and development to meet fast-evolving customer needs,” said Saranga Ranasinghe, Assistant Vice-President, Moody’s Investors Service.
The agency, however, said Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, the top two software exporters, can be an exception to it. “TCS and Infosys, therefore, have the financial strength to invest in their businesses and respond to external pressures, despite their high shareholder payouts,” he said.
According to the agency, TCS and Infosys have cash balances of USD 6.6 billion and USD 4.4 billion, respectively.
However, others who had done buybacks, including Genpact, Marble II (Mphasis) and HT Global IT Solutions (Hexaware), have retained little cash for growth spending after returning large amounts to shareholders, it said. These three firms have a limited ability to incur fresh debt at their current rating levels, the agency added.
In the last year, five of the six IT firms it rates have returned back 130 per cent of cash flow from operations less capital spending to shareholders. 
The agency said it is important for companies to maintain “solid liquidity buffers” to respond to changing business conditions in the face of challenges like rising competition, pricing pressure and increasing employment costs. It expects the Indian IT firms to have a good showing in the next two years, largely due to demand for digital solutions."
167,2018-10-20,Infosys,"Calendar bull-call spread on Infosys 
The outlook for Infosys (₹684) remains positive. The stock finds an immediate support at ₹642 and resistance at ₹724. A conclusive close above the latter will trigger a fresh rally in Infosys.
In that event, it could register a new peak and may reach ₹810. The stock finds a crucial support at ₹590; a close below this level will alter the bullish view. We expect the stock to remain bullish and touch a new peak.
F&O pointer: The Infosys futures is quoting in discount, with respect to the spot price due to dividend (₹7), for which the ex-date is October 25. The counter witnessed a healthy roll-over of 22 per cent to the November series. Trading in Option indicates that the stock could move in a ₹650-750 range.
Strategy: We advise traders to consider a calendar bull-call spread on Infosys. This can be initiated by selling the current month ₹680-call and simultaneously buying the ₹680 November call. They closed with a premium of ₹9.05 and ₹24.90, respectively. As the market lot is 1,200 units per contract, the strategy will cost ₹19,020. This will be the maximum loss one could suffer in this strategy, if Infosys dips below ₹680 at the time of (November) expiry.
However, the potential for profit is huge if Infosys takes a dip in the next four days and gains sharply in the next series. We advise traders to hold the position till mid-November. The position will turn positive once Infosys moves past ₹695.85. Traders could consider exiting from the position if the loss mounts to ₹9,500. This strategy is for traders who can withstand the risk in options trading."

SBI (₹285.4)
SBI skyrocketed 15 per cent last week. The stock tested the ₹290-292 resistance region on Friday and has come-off slightly after making a high of ₹292.65. As long as it trades below ₹292, an intermediate dip to ₹280 or ₹276 cannot be ruled out. Key supports are at ₹279 and ₹276. A strong break below ₹276 can drag SBI initially to ₹268. A further break below ₹268 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹260 or ₹257 over the short term. On the other hand, if SBI manages to bounce from ₹276, the outlook will remain bullish. In such a scenario, the possibility of the stock breaching above ₹292 will be high. A strong break above ₹292 will trigger a fresh rally to ₹311. A further break above ₹311 can then take SBI to the next target of ₹322. Short-term traders with a high-risk appetite can go long on dips at ₹282 and accumulate at ₹279. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹271 for the target of ₹305. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹285 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹292.





ITC (₹282.3)
ITC fell in the initial part of last week, but managed to bounce from the low of ₹273.15. The price action on the chart indicates that the stock is getting fresh buying interest below the support level of ₹275. This keeps the bias positive. An up-move to ₹287 and ₹292 is likely in the near term. Inability to breach ₹292 can drag it to ₹280 and ₹275 again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹275 and ₹292 can be seen for some time. But a strong break above ₹292 can take ITC higher to ₹298 and ₹300. A further break above ₹300 will then pave way for the next target of ₹307. The bullish outlook will get negated only if ITC makes a decisive close below ₹275. Such a break will increase the possibility of the stock falling to ₹270 or even ₹265 in the coming days. Traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹283 and ₹280. Retain the stop-loss at ₹273 for the target of ₹298. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹285 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹289.





Infosys (₹662)
Infosys surged over 9 per cent intra week, but failed to sustain higher. The pull-back from ₹693.9 indicates that the stock is getting fresh sellers at higher levels. Near-term resistance is in the ₹680-682 region. As long as the stock trades below this resistance zone, a fall to test the key support level of ₹630 is possible again. If Infosys manages to bounce from ₹630, it can remain range-bound between ₹630 and ₹700. However, the outlook will continue to be negative as long as the stock remains below ₹700. An eventual break below ₹630 can drag Infosys lower to ₹600 and ₹590. Traders can hold the short positions taken at ₹670 and ₹675. Retain the stop-loss at ₹710 for the target of ₹600. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹665 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹655. The outlook will turn positive only if the stock manages to rise past the psychological level of ₹700. The next targets are ₹720 and ₹730. However, such a strong up-move looks less probable at the moment.





RIL (₹1,074.2)
RIL traded in a narrow range between ₹1,047 and ₹1,093 last week. The near-term outlook is unclear. Immediate resistance is in the ₹1,088-1,090 region. If RIL manages to breach ₹1,090 decisively, an up-move to ₹1,130 or ₹1,135 is possible. A strong break above ₹1,035 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its rally to ₹1,185 or even ₹1,200. But a pull-back from ₹1,135 can drag the stock lower to ₹1,080 and ₹1,050 and keep it range-bound between ₹1,030 and ₹1,135 . On the other hand, if RIL fails to breach ₹1,090, it can break below the near-term support level of ₹1,050 and fall initially to ₹1,030. A further break below ₹1,030 will increase the selling pressure and drag RIL to ₹1,010 and ₹990 thereafter. Traders who have taken short positions at ₹1,075 and ₹1,085 on rallies last week should remain cautious. Stop-loss can be lowered to ₹1,105. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹1,060 as soon as RIL declines to ₹1,045. Book profits at ₹1,015.





Tata Steel (₹573.7)
Tata Steel tumbled about 4 per cent intraweek to make a low of ₹530. However, it managed to reverse higher sharply, recovering all the loss, and closed over 4 per cent higher for the week. A key resistance is at ₹583. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹595 and ₹600. It will also confirm an inverted head and shoulder pattern on the chart. A pull-back from the ₹595-600 region can find support in the broad ₹580-₹570 region. An eventual break above ₹600 can then target ₹615 and ₹625. On the other hand, if the stock reverses lower from ₹583, it can fall to ₹570 or ₹565. A further break below ₹565 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹550 and ₹540. Traders holding short positions at an average price of ₹561 should remain cautious and revise the stop-loss lower to ₹585. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹557 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹552. Book profits at ₹540."

K Venkatasubramanian
After a period of continuous disruptions, with several senior management changes over the last three to four years, Infosys (₹662) is set for a reasonably smooth digital ride. With a new CEO, the focus on growth seems to have returned for Infosys.
A rapidly expanding digital services business, healthy large-sized deal wins and solid traction in key verticals are positives for the company.
At the current price, the stock trades at a reasonable 16 times its likely per share earnings for FY20. The company’s PE multiples have hovered around 18-19 times over the past three years. Despite rallying more than 40 per cent over the past one year, the shares of Infosys still appear to be attractive for investors with a two-to three-year horizon.
There is considerable valuation comfort, with underlying earnings growth likely to take an upward trajectory over the next few years, more so as the rupee remains weak against the dollar.
In the first half of FY19, Infosys’ revenues grew by 14.7 per cent to ₹39,737 crore, while net profits rose by 7.1 per cent to ₹7,721 crore. The company’s revenues have grown at a compounded annual rate of 9.8 per cent between FY15 and FY18.
As clients increasingly demand automation of normal application services and look at increasing spends on advanced technologies, Infosys upped the focus on its digital offerings significantly. The digital business accounted for 31 per cent of the company’s revenues in the September quarter, up from 25 per cent in the same period last year. In fact, revenues from digital services have been growing in double-digits even on a sequential basis for the past four to six quarters.
The financial services vertical has picked up pace in the last few quarters, while retail and manufacturing have steadily increased contribution to revenues over the past one year.
Thanks to elevated oil prices, and the resultant increase in capex spends of clients in the space, the energy and utilities vertical has rebounded well too. These segments together contribute more than 70 per cent of Infosys’ revenues, indicating broad-based growth for the company. Over the last one year, the company has added four new clients in the $100-million bucket; three in the $50-million category and as many as 19 customers in the $10-million bracket.
In fact, in the recent September quarter, the company signed $2-billion of large-deals.

Hindustan Unilever has lost 12 per cent so far from its one-year high of ₹1,808 touched in end-August 2018. While it may still look a bit pricey trading at 60 times its trailing 12-month earnings, a solid recovery in consumption, post-demonetisation and GST move, a stronghold in the rural market (40 per cent of sales) — which is growing faster than the urban segment — and a diversified product portfolio with market leadership in several categories make HUL (₹1,633) a good long-term bet. Investors can take exposure to the stock now and also accumulate on any further dips due to market volatility.
Consumption has posted a convincing comeback after derailing due to demonetisation and GST. After recording a flat (year-on-year) growth in domestic volumes in the June 2017 quarter due to the GST transition, HUL’s volumes have gained traction, growing 10-12 per cent in each of the quarters beginning October to December 2017.
Superior product mix, as well as price increases to pass on rise in input prices, have helped the company record a price/mix led growth of 4-6 per cent over the last few quarters. Profit growth in these periods has also been strong, at 14-27 per cent in each of the last four quarters. All segments of the company — be it home care, beauty and personal care or food and refreshments — have more or less been contributing equally to the strong show.
In the near to medium term, while rising interest rates and a tight liquidity situation among lenders may dampen discretionary consumption to an extent, consumer non-durables may continue to do well.
HUL, with its wide reach as well as differentiated products across price points will be a beneficiary. Going forward, increasing consumer preference for premium products as well as the company’s pricing power to pass on any cost increases will drive improvement in realisations and margins. For the next leg of growth, HUL is focusing on widening the reach of products in under-penetrated categories in hair/personal care.
Towards expanding the market for its ‘naturals’ portfolio, the company is following a three-pronged strategy of introducing natural variants in its existing brands, building a bouquet of natural products under the ‘Lever Ayush’ brand and also building specialist natural brands such as Indulekha.

The stock of Titan Company (₹871), is a good long-term buy for your portfolio. Continued growth in market share in the jewellery segment, launches across product segments and the success of its gold savings and gold exchange schemes that bring new customers, are reasons behind the stronger-than-industry-average growth.
While the last few years have been challenging for the gems and jewellery industry with new regulations and higher import duty on gold which hit consumer sentiments, Titan has managed a decent show. Between 2013-14 and 2017-18, the company recorded revenue growth of 9 per cent and net profit growth of 12 per cent (CAGR). Operating margins of the jewellery and watches segments have improved, thanks to better product mix and cost-cutting. In the jewellery segment, EBIT margins were 9-10 per cent in 2015-16; they now stand at 11-13 per cent.
Revenue growth is likely to be higher over the next five years, given the GST-led push to shift in consumer demand from the unorganised to branded jewellers,
Higher import duties, if any, may not significantly impact Titan, as its gold exchange scheme is working well. The company sources a chunk of its requirement from old gold that customers bring for exchange.
While the Q1 2018-19 performance was not good , stronger-than-expected revenue growth is expected in Q2. The company, in its Q2 preview, reported that growth in the jewellery segment was good, despite headwinds, including higher gold prices, weak consumer sentiment and fewer wedding dates. Higher sales of diamond jewellery and launch of new collections in studded gold jewellery and silver were reasons for the healthy growth. The watches segment continued to see good momentum in the quarter, led by new products across affordable, work and fashion categories.
The stock has corrected from ₹1,000 in April. At current levels, the stock discounts its estimated earnings for 2019-20 by 40 times. It was trading at 53 times, its one-year forward earnings, a year back.

The Reliance Industries (₹1,074) juggernaut seems set to roll on, with the company firing on multiple cylinders. Its financial performance has been consistently healthy with profit growth of 19 per cent in 2016-17, 20 per cent in 2017-18 and 18 per cent Y-o-Y in the half-year ended September 2018. This has been driven by the massive investments made by the company in its mainstay hydrocarbon businesses — refining and petrochemicals — and in its new-age consumer businesses – digital (RJio) and retail. Strong growth in these segments has more than offset the decline in fortunes in the oil and gas exploration business that has shrunk sharply due to declining volumes.
RIL should continue to do well in the years ahead, thanks to its deep coffers and execution capabilities that allow it to invest big, achieve massive scale, and dominate industries. A diversified presence across businesses hedges risk. The mega investment phase in its hydrocarbon segments seems to be plateauing, for now. But growth in these cyclical businesses should remain healthy with the commissioning of some new facilities in the quarters ahead and also due to regulatory benefits such as fuel specification changes by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).
Meanwhile, RIL continues to invest aggressively in the retail and digital businesses, which are likely to keep growing rapidly. This is in line with the company’s plan to grow the profits of the consumer businesses to the extent of the hydrocarbon businesses; currently, the consumer businesses contribute about a quarter of total operating profits. Addition of retail stores and telecom subscribers are likely to continue at a brisk pace. Organic growth is being supplemented through strategic acquisitions. Listing of the digital and retail businesses sometime in the future could mean significant value unlocking for RIL shareholders. Investors with a long-term perspective can buy the stock.
The RIL stock made a roaring comeback from February 2017, more than doubling until August this year. But since then, the stock has lost about 20 per cent, largely due to the ongoing market weakness. This provides an entry point for long-term investors. The stock now trades at about 16.5 times the trailing 12-month earnings, lower than the average 17 times over the past year.

Amid the persisting challenges in the banking sector, HDFC Bank (₹1,947) has managed to put up a good show over the past few years, even as its peers have been weighed down by asset quality issues.
Strong loan growth, steady net interest margin and a stable asset quality have kept the private lender’s earnings in good stead.
HDFC Bank, the largest private bank, has been steadily growing its loan book by about 20-25 per cent (year-on-year) on an average over the last seven to eight quarters. It has been gaining market share, as public sector banks continue to consolidate their loan books. HDFC Bank has also retained its top slot within the private bank space over the past three years.
At the current price, the stock trades at about 3.1 times its one-year forward book value, lower than its three-year average of 3.4 times.
This offers long-term investors a good opportunity to buy the stock at the current levels, given that the bank’s earnings are likely to grow by 18-20 per cent over the next two years. The bank’s recent September quarter performance has also been noteworthy.
It delivered 24 per cent Y-o-Y growth in domestic loans in the September quarter, led by good traction in both retail and corporate loans. Notably, the pace of growth in the bank’s core net interest income that had moderated in the past two quarters, has witnessed a pick up in the latest September quarter.
From 17.7 per cent Y-o-Y growth in the March quarter, net interest income grew by a slower 15.4 per cent in the June quarter.
However, in the latest September quarter, HDFC Bank’s net interest income grew by a higher 20.6 per cent. Overall, the bank’s net profit for the quarter has grown by 20.6 per cent Y-o-Y, a healthy performance, given the ongoing challenges within the sector.
HDFC Bank’s GNPAs that had been hovering around the 1 per cent mark in the past, has inched up slightly over the past one year. In the latest September quarter, the bank’s GNPA stood at 1.33 per cent of loans."
163,2018-11-09,Infosys,"What can shareholders make out of campus visits to companies?
The shareholders of Infosys will have a chance to visit the company’s Mysuru campus on November 24. Those who are keen to explore and experience the ‘state-of-the-art’ campus in Mysuru are requested to register on the company website between October 25 and November 15, the IT major has said.
“As the company can host only a limited number of individuals on this visit, shareholders will be accommodated on a first-come-first-served basis. This offer is open to shareholders only, and is not extended to family and friends,” it added.
The company will provide transport from its registered office in Electronics City, Bengaluru, to Mysuru and back, and bear the costs of the visit.
Companies inviting their shareholders to visit their premises is not new at the global level. Even in India, some have made plant visits a routine affair.
Bimetal Bearings had arranged a meeting of their shareholders to visit its strip mill plant at Sembiam, Chennai, in 2014.
In 2013, 190 shareholders and 29 joint shareholders had visited the Mumbai plant of Hind Rectifiers.
This is a nice gesture from the company to involve the shareholders and make them understand how the business is being run or conducted.
This can even be recommended by the market regulator as a good corporate governance practice. The shareholder, as part-owner of the company, gets to interact with its employees, who can throw some light on the performance of the management as well as the company.
Shareholders should know their right to inspect the statutory registers at the registered office of the company.
Companies can improve upon visits by arranging an interactive session between visiting shareholders who can talk freely and air grievances with the management team that includes the auditors. Like AGM and board meeting minutes, even the minutes of shareholder visits can be disclosed to the exchanges.
The management can also allow the shareholders to raise questions post visit within a stipulated time.
On the shareholders’ part, instead of treating this as a fun outing, they should prepare well by studying all the necessary documents before visiting the company.
Shareholders of Infosys may not have much to see on product or assembly line, as it is a service provider. However, they will get to see the tech company’s people power in action, and no doubt, the picturesque campus will enthral the visitors."

Infosys said on Wednesday that it will open its next Technology and Innovation Hub in Texas and hire 500 American workers in the state by 2020. Infosys has hired over 6,200 American workers since May 2017.
The Hub will be located in Richardson, Texas and have a special focus on the telecommunications, retail and banking sectors.
These new Texas employees will include recent graduates from the state’s prestigious colleges, universities and community colleges who will benefit from upskilling through Infosys’ training curriculum, the company said in a statement.
“Digital is rapidly changing every industry, and our hubs will allow us to co-locate, co-innovate and co-create alongside our clients,” said Pravin Rao, Chief Operating Officer, Infosys.
To date, Infosys has opened two Technology and Innovation Hubs, one in Indianapolis, Indiana and another in Raleigh, North Carolina.

 India’s second largest IT services major Infosys will set up a technology and innovation hub in the American state of Texas and hire 500 American workers in the state by 2020. 
The hub will be located in Richardson, Texas and have a special focus on telecommunications, retail and banking sectors, it said in a statement.
Last year, Infosys had announced setting up of four such hubs and hiring about 10,000 locals in the US by 2019. Infosys has hired over 6,200 American workers since May 2017. “Infosys’ investment in Texas reinforces the company’s commitment to driving digital transformation for American enterprises by leveraging local talent alongside the best global talent,” the statement said. 
These new Texas employees will include recent graduates from the state’s network of colleges, universities and community colleges who will benefit from upskilling through Infosys’ world-class training curriculum, it added.
“We are excited to announce the expansion of our presence in Texas, which is another important step in our continued investment in driving digital transformation for American businesses,” Infosys Chief Operating Officer Pravin Rao said. He added that digitalisation is rapidly changing every industry, and the hubs will allow the company to “co-locate, co-innovate and co-create” alongside its clients.
Ravi Kumar, President at Infosys, said the investment in Texas will further improve the Bengaluru-based company’s ability to serve clients by broadening the STEM talent pipeline in the state and provide training for the specialist skills that its clients need.
To date, Infosys has opened two Technology and Innovation Hubs - one in Indianapolis, Indiana and another in Raleigh, North Carolina. The company has also announced to set up more such hubs in Hartford, Connecticut and Phoenix, Arizona, as well as a unique Design and Innovation Hub in Providence, Rhode Island.
Also, Infosys Foundation USA provides multiple grants for classroom technology and computer science training to teachers and schools. To date, more than 4.7 million students; 13,000 teachers and 21,000 schools across America, including over 11,164 students, 256 teachers and 252 schools in Texas, have benefited from computer science training and classroom equipment funded by Infosys Foundation USA."

 IT services firm Infosys on Wednesday said it will set up three innovation hubs in Australia and create 1,200 jobs in the country by 2020.
The Bengaluru-based company is already setting up similar hubs in the US - its largest market - and expects to hire 10,000 local workers by 2019.
“The creation of 1,200 IT jobs in Australia by 2020, of which around 40 per cent will be Australian university graduates from a range of fields including computer science and design,” Infosys said in a statement.
It added that the new innovation hubs will serve as a platform to enable Infosys to co-create and co-innovate alongside clients, academia and government to accelerate innovation and upskilling of talent in emerging technologies and solutions. No investment details were disclosed.
Infosys said this approach provides the company with a strong foundation to meet rising demand for expertise in areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), user experience, cyber security, digital platforms, big data and cloud.
“Today marks an important milestone for our company in our 20 year journey in Australia,” Pravin Rao, Chief Operating Officer at Infosys, said.
As a key technology partner of Australian business, Infosys is proud to announce its commitment to accelerating digital skills in the region through the creation of 1,200 skilled jobs, the development of our new innovation hubs and deepening partnerships with academia, he added.
Infosys, like many of its peers, has been ramping local hiring in key markets like the US, the UK and Australia to tackle increasing scrutiny around work visas by various governments.
This is also part of Infosys’ three-pronged strategy of focussing on stabilising the company’s business in 2018-19, build momentum next year, followed by acceleration in 2020-21.
Infosys said it has recruited 75 graduates, and more than half have completed their induction training and are ready to be placed on strategic client projects.
“Under this programme, graduates start their Infosys learning journey in our Sydney and Melbourne training centres. They can choose from high demand areas, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, user experience, cyber security, cloud and big data,” Infosys Senior Vice President for Australia and New Zealand Andrew Groth said.
So far, Infosys has opened two technology and innovation hubs, one in Indianapolis, Indiana and another in Raleigh, North Carolina in the US.
Infosys has also announced setting up of more such hubs in Hartford, Connecticut and Phoenix, Arizona, as well as a unique design and innovation hub in Providence, Rhode Island.

Around 40 per cent of the jobs will be filled by Australian university graduates from a range of fields including Computer Science and Design.

158,2018-11-21,Infosys,"Infosys hits 5-month low; chart suggests further down

While Infosys has announced its intention to hire from campuses, it has seen a high level of attrition over the past three quarters


While Infosys has announced its intention to hire from campuses, it has seen a high level of attrition over the past three quarters

Shares of software services exporter Infosys on Wednesday fell as much as 2.99 per cent to ₹ 622.20, its lowest since June 22. The stock breached below its 200-day exponential moving average, which is a bearish sign.
The scrip has broken below the support at ₹ 629.5 also, the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the uptrend from August 22, 2017 low to October 1, 2018 high, suggests it may fall up to the next support at 590.75, the 50 per cent retracement level.
The Trend Intensity (TI) indicator rises to 16, suggesting a new downtrend has started. The MACD is negative and below its signal line."
155,2018-11-28,Infosys,"Is Infosys getting ‘boring’ for its employees?
 
With two more quarters to go, IT giant Infosys has already witnessed the exit of as many 37,430 employees, which is 90 per cent of those who quit the company during the entire FY18.
At the same time, there has been a significant increase in the number of hires during the first two quarters compared with the entire fiscal last year: 13,598 hires compared with 3,743 for the entire FY18.
However, the company, in its 2018 annual report, stated that it received 15.4 lakh applications compared with 12.93 lakh in 2017.
While Infosys continues to remain an attractive option for software engineers, the attrition rate has grown too.
“In my view, lack of onsite opportunities (due to visa tightening), coupled with lack of cutting-edge projects, is the reason why so many people are leaving the company,” the head of an executive search firm, who did not want to be named, said. He pointed out that over half of 37,430 who left this fiscal had work experience in excess of six years.
An Infosys spokesperson did not comment on the trend and said the company will stick to its statement shared during the Q2 results.
In Q2, Infosys had said that attrition had fallen marginally from 23 per cent in Q1 to 22.2 per cent.
ALSO READ: ‘Infosys will sustain recruitment momentum’
Kris Lakshmikanth, CEO, Headhunters India, said that the increased attrition is largely due to an organisational rejig driven by the need to balance the workforce with millennial talent that is flexible to work on new-age technologies such as machine learning or AI.
Infosys, like others in the $155-billion IT industry, is preparing the current and future workforce for the work ahead.
But this transition is coming with a lot of pain for employees, a former top executive with Infosys told BusinessLine.
While hiring has come down, it cannot be inferred that this is due to lack of demand. The company had seen an uptick in demand in the quarter ended September, UB Pravin Rao, COO, Infosys, had said.
However, he did not specify how many graduates Infosys plans to hire. Going by the past year’s hiring numbers that should sound like music for the software engineers. Infosys closed the 2018 financial year with 2,04,107 employees.
For the country’s second largest software exporter, which essentially built the Indian outsourcing industry, the past few years have been tough.
After Vishal Sikka quit as CEO due to differences with the founders, Nandan Nilekani, one of the founders and who took over as Chairman (following Sikka’s exit), said in a press conference that he wanted Infosys to be “boring”.
While he may not have meant it literally, millennials in fact find these companies “boring”.

According to Neelam K, a full (software) stack developer at a leading health-tech start-up, there was no dilemma when it came to choosing between Infosys and the start-up she is working in.




 
“To me, the question — whether to work for a large company with an unclear career path or work for a start-up where there is no hierarchy and where one could work across different technologies —was a no-brainer,” she said.
 
“Millennial people don’t want to work on old technologies,” said Vaibhav Datar, a mid-life career coach for companies and entrepreneurs.
Also, unlike 10-15 years ago, job stability is no longer a concern with the sheer volume of start-ups looking for fresh talent.
“Today’s millennials are showing a clear preference for product companies over service companies and the attraction of better pay and faster adoption of new and exciting technologies is also driving them to start-ups, said Ravi Kaklasaria, Founder & CEO, SpringPeople.
While the churn goes on, Infosys continues with its hiring plans abroad.
India’s second largest IT services firm had said in 2017 that it will hire about 10,000 locals across the US, focusing on AI, user experience, machine learning, cloud and big data. Since announcing its intent, Infosys has hired around 5,000 locals.
In a similar effort, the company, a few days ago, said that it will launch three “Innovation Hubs” in Australia by 2020, which will create 1,200 jobs."

Infosys has inaugurated its new technology and innovation hub at Hartford in the US. The company has hired more than 7,000 American workers in the last 18 months as part of its ongoing commitment to accelerate the pace of digital innovation for American enterprises.
“The Hartford hub...will help Infosys work more closely with its clients in the region and will serve as the global hub for Infosys’ InsurTech and HealthTech efforts. The hub will feature living labs for the future of insurance, future of healthcare and the future of manufacturing among others,” Infosys said in a BSE filing today.
Infosys COO UB Pravin Rao said the inauguration of Hartford technology and innovation hub is an important milestone in the company’s ongoing efforts to help American enterprises revitalise their core businesses.
“This hub, along with five other hubs around the country, will help us to seamlessly collaborate with our clients to develop agile, cross-functional digital solutions to today’s most pressing business needs,” he added."
152,2018-12-14,Infosys,"Infosys forms joint venture with Hitachi, Panasonic Corp
Infosys has formed a joint venture with Hitachi, Panasonic Corporation and Pasona to strengthen its presence in the Japanese market. As part of the agreement, Infosys will acquire 81 per cent of the shareholding in Hitachi Procurement Service Co, Hitachi’s fully owned subsidiary.
Hitachi, Panasonic and Pasona will be minority shareholders of the entity. Consideration for 81 per cent stake, subject to closing adjustments, is ¥2,762 million (approx Rs 174.58 crore).
“As part of the transaction, Infosys Consulting Pte. Ltd. will acquire an 81 per cent stake in HIPUS from Hitachi by way of an acquisition of existing shares,” Infosys said in a regulatory filing today.
Hitachi will transfer 2 per cent each to Panasonic and Pasona, and will hold the remaining 15 per cent. The transaction is expected to close by April 1, 2019, subject to customary closing conditions.
“The transaction is in alignment with Infosys’ strategy to strengthen its presence in Japan and invest in local capabilities to serve the local and global needs of Japanese corporations,” the filing said.
Hitachi Procurement currently handles indirect materials purchasing functions for the Hitachi Group.
“...iconic companies coming together, will accelerate business process transformation leveraging digital procurement platforms for the local and global needs of Japanese corporations,” a company statement said.
Infosys will bring its expertise in procurement processes, consulting, analytics and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotic process automation to the venture.
Combined with Hitachi and Panasonic’s knowledge of their procurement functions and local teams, and Pasona’s human capital and BPM networks in Japan, the entity will provide differentiated, end-to-end, efficient and high value procurement capabilities to corporations, the statement said.
“This joint venture will help Japanese corporations transform their procurement processes using next-generation digital platforms, as we bring together the combined power of deep procurement expertise, technology, global expertise and local skills,” Infosys President Ravi Kumar said.
Infosys Executive Vice President and Head (Corporate Strategy) Deepak Padaki said Japan is a strategic market for the company.
“This transaction is a significant demonstration of our commitment to building a local presence in the region in order to partner with our Japanese clients and accelerate their digital journey,” he added."

151,2018-12-16,Infosys,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (₹289.1)
SBI opened the week on a negative note with a wide gap-down of ₹14 at ₹261.1. The stop-loss on the long positions recommended was hit. However, the stock managed to claw-back from the low of ₹261.1, recovering all the loss and closed on a positive note. The stock was up 5 per cent for the week. A crucial near-term resistance is at ₹294. Whether SBI breaks above this hurdle or not will determine the direction of the next move. Inability to breach ₹294 can pull the stock lower to ₹278 or ₹274 in the near term. A further break below ₹274 will then target ₹269. On the other hand, if SBI breaks above ₹294 decisively, it can gain strength. Such a break can take the stock initially higher to ₹310 and ₹312. A strong break above ₹312 will then pave way for the next target of ₹322 thereafter. Short-term traders can go long on a break above ₹294. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹282 for the target of ₹318. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹307.





ITC (₹275.6)
ITC broke below the key support level of ₹271 in the initial part of the week. However, negative sentiment was short-lived as ITC reversed sharply higher, recovering all the loss from the low of ₹268.2. Though the daily candles on the chart give mixed signals, the weekly candles are relatively positive. Support is in the ₹272-271 region. As long as the stock remains above this support zone, there is a strong likelihood of it breaking above the near-term resistance level of ₹279. Such a break can take ITC initially higher to ₹285 or ₹287. A further break above ₹287 will increase the possibility of the stock extending its up-move towards the 21-week moving average resistance level of ₹293. The bullish outlook will get negated if ITC breaks and closes decisively below ₹271. The stock can, thus, fall initially to ₹267. A bounce from ₹267 can take the stock higher to ₹271 and ₹272 again. But a strong break below ₹267 will increase the downside pressure. This will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹262 thereafter.





Infosys (₹705.6)
Infosys is retaining its strength. The stock was up for the third consecutive week. It surged 3.6 per cent, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹687 and closed on a strong note. The outlook is bullish. Immediate support is at ₹698 and the next key support is at ₹688. Also, there is an inverted head and shoulder pattern visible on the daily chart. This is a bullish reversal pattern. The neckline support of this pattern is at ₹684. Intermediate dips in the near term are likely to find fresh buyers coming into the market. An up-move to ₹721 is likely in the near term. Inability to breach ₹721 can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹700. But an eventual break above ₹721 will boost the momentum. This will increase the likelihood of the stock revisiting ₹740 and ₹750 levels. Traders can go long at current levels and also accumulate on dips at the levels of ₹701 and ₹693. Keep the stop-loss at ₹675 for the target of ₹760. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹715 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹730.





RIL (₹1,111.7)
RIL fell for the second consecutive week. The stock was down about 2 per cent last week. However, the sharp bounce from the week’s low of ₹1,055 gives a breather for the stock. The 200-day as well as a trend-line, both poised around ₹1,055, has provided strong support for RIL. The near-term outlook is mixed. Resistance is at ₹1,128. If RIL manages to sustain above ₹1,100 and decisively break above ₹1,128, the near-term outlook will turn positive. An up-move to ₹1,160 is possible. A further break above ₹1,160 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹1,185. On the other hand, if RIL declines below ₹1,100, it can fall to ₹1,055 again. A further break below ₹1,055 will increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹1,030 or even ₹1,010 thereafter. Broadly, RIL has been range-bound between ₹1,050 and ₹1,200 since October. A decisive breakout on either side of ₹1,050 or ₹1,200 will determine the direction of the next move. Traders can stay out of this stock until a clear trend emerges.





Tata Steel (₹513.4)
Tata Steel snapped its three-week fall. The stock reversed higher from the low of ₹486.9, recovering all the loss and closed 1.1 per cent higher for the week. Though the stock has bounced back, the price action seems to be lacking strength. This leaves the bias negative and keeps the broader downtrend intact. Cluster of resistance is poised in the ₹530-540 region, which can cap the upside in the near term. If Tata Steel manages to breach ₹540, an upmove to ₹565 and ₹570 is possible. But while below ₹540, a fall again to ₹485 and ₹480 cannot be ruled out. A bounce from around ₹480 again can keep the stock range-bound between ₹480 and ₹540. But a strong break below ₹480 can drag Tata Steel lower to ₹460. The level of ₹460 is a crucial long-term trend support, which may have the potential to halt the downtrend that has been in place since the beginning of this year.

The Infosys Foundation, the philanthropic arm of IT-major Infosys, contributed Rs 2.2 crore towards the construction of basic amenities in five schools situated in Karnataka’s Kolar District.
Authorities said that this is part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Some of the initiatives include the construction of toilet blocks and water purification plants at a few schools run by the state government.
Previously, the Infosys Foundation sponsored the construction of a building at the new English school in the Uttara Kannada district.
They also supported the development of infrastructure in other districts of the state as well as aided a project for the Yojak Centre for Research and Strategic Planning for Sustainable Development.

Infosys has appointed Nilanjan Roy as Chief Financial Officer, almost exactly a year after Salil Parekh’s appointment as CEO.
Roy joins Infosys from Bharti Airtel and will take over the reins from Jayesh Sanghrajka from March next year, the company said in a filing. 
Sanghrajka will then resume his role as Deputy CFO once Roy takes over. 
Further, Roy has spent more than a dozen years in Airtel where he was the global CFO.

146,2018-12-24,Infosys,"Infy unlikely to raise buyback price above ₹900-mark, say analysts
Infosys is unlikely to raise the buyback price above the ₹900 per share-mark it had offered during the previous round which was worth ₹13,000 crore.
Analysts that BusinessLine spoke to said that India’s second-largest software exporter, which is understood to be readying a second  buyback, is likely to offer much below the price in the earlier round.
Infosys announced at its March-ending annual results that as per the capital allocation policy for fiscal 2019, the board has decided to pay off ₹13,000 crore and a special dividend of ₹10 per share, as part of its plan to payout up to 70 per cent of its free cash flow every financial year. In fiscal 2018, Infosys bought back shares at a premium of 27.8 per cent at ₹900 per share. An email sent to Infosys did not elicit a response.




 
 
“A share buyback augurs well to enhance shareholder value and restores confidence amongst shareholders,” said Urmil Shah, IT analyst, IDBI Capital.
Madhu Babu, Research Analyst — Institutional Equities, Prabhudas Lilladher, is of the opinion that Infosys should continue to buy back 4 per cent of equity this year too, as this would lead to gradual shrinkage of net cash on the balance sheet. According to data, Infosys generated free cash flow of $360 million in the September-ended quarter, and in the last fiscal had cash flow of around ₹12,000 crore.
Buyback was not a part of the management agenda till recently. In 2017, Infosys made changes to its Articles of Association in conformity with the Companies Act, 2013 to accommodate buybacks. Interestingly, Infosys could follow the trend of cross-town rival Wipro, which has done two consecutive buybacks (this fiscal and the last one) to reward investors at a time when it too faces growth pressures.
In December 2017, Wipro concluded the second buyback of 34.37 crore equity shares. This resulted in a total cash outflow of ₹11,000 crore. Peers too conducted buybacks recently — TCS for ₹16,000 crore, and HCL Tech for ₹3,500 crore.
“The industry as a whole is trying to recapture growth and since they have piled up huge cash, it is time to reward shareholders when growth is muted,” said an analyst from a multinational brokerage house."

AI tools will help reduce the need to employ a large number of experts, according to Infosys
   -  kynny

Finding talent in certain areas is as hard for some of the biggest names in the Indian IT sector, as it is for a small firm. 
To counter the challenge, Infosys is now betting on new-age technologies to help address its talent woes .
“We are actively scouting for start-ups which bring different capabilities in the areas of text and speech processing, which are very vital to a lot of AI capabilities required for our clients in the near future,” Satish HC, EVP - Head Global Services - Data and Analytics, told BusinessLine. 
Infosys is specifically scouting for start-ups which are already 1-2 years into their journey, and have beta versions of their products up and running. 
The company will then run proofs of concept with these start-ups, and if the solution works for Infosys, it’ll either partner with them and take them to market, or invest in them. 
“We look at it as access to innovation, to take it as a solution to our clients. It can be as simple as an alliance partnership. If we see big potential, we may even participate in their Series-B or Series-C funding for their own scale-up. And then at some point, if it makes sense, we may not be averse to acquisitions; but our fundamental focus would on a partnership or an investment to have a deeper collaboration,” said Satish.
Within AI, Infosys is looking specifically at three areas: text processing, speech processing, and democratisation of AI and machine learning. 
According to Satish, availability of talent in the AI space is a big challenge the entire industry is faced with, and that is where tools that democratise AI can help. 
“We are in fact talking to one of the top global universities. They have an initiative to democratise AI and machine learning, so that we don’t need an army of people,” said Satish. 
With tools that can democratise AI, instead of needing 10 data scientists, Infosys could be able to function with just two. 
The rest will be provided by the platform or technology tool-set. 
“The other advantage is I can do this with lesser use of experience, because you can’t find PhDs. I can run with one PhD and four raw computer science graduates straight out of school, who are trained on the work. So that is the kind of impact we are looking at, and based on what we did for the analytics work-bench for regular data science, we see 30-40 per cent improvement in productivity,” Satish said.
Infosys started investing in AI and cloud technologies about two years ago, and already has its AI platform called Nia, which was launched in April last year. In September, the company partnered with Google to build ‘Data Native Intelligent Enterprise’ powered by the ‘Infosys Digital Brain’ on the Google Cloud Platform. 
Satish insists that despite tools that will cut down on the need to hire an army of data scientists, Infosys still need to hire a number of engineers in the space, as these tools will only ease the pressure to scout for experts in large numbers.."

SBI (₹294.4) 
SBI is managing to sustain higher. The stock dipped to an intraweek low of ₹287.2, but reversed immediately higher from there. The resistance at ₹301 is likely to be tested in the near term. Inability to breach ₹301 can pull SBI lower to ₹290 and ₹287 again. But the price action on the chart leaves the bias bullish for the stock to break above ₹301 and rally towards ₹310 and ₹312. A further break above ₹312 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹320 and ₹322. The region around ₹322 is a crucial long-term resistance. The price action around this hurdle will need a close watch to get a cue on the next direction of move. Supports are at ₹287 and ₹284.5. The near-term view will turn negative only if SBI declines below ₹284.5. The next target is ₹280. But such a fall looks less probable at the moment. Traders who have taken long positions above ₹294 can hold with a stop-loss at ₹282. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock goes up to ₹307. Book profits at ₹318. 





ITC (₹281.9) 
ITC inched higher for the third consecutive week. The stock was up 2 per cent last week. Immediate resistance is at ₹284 and support at ₹278. The stock is likely to breach ₹284 and test ₹287 in the near term. A break above ₹287 can then target ₹290. The levels of ₹287 and ₹290 are key resistances, and whether ITC breaches these hurdles or not will decide the direction of the next move. A decisive break above ₹290 will boost the momentum and take ITC higher to ₹296 and ₹300 thereafter. Such an up-move will also confirm the end of the downtrend that has been in place since September. On the other hand, if ITC reverses lower from ₹287 or ₹290, it can fall to ₹280 and ₹275 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹275 and ₹290.





Infosys (₹657.6) 
Infosys fell in the initial part of the week but managed to claw-back from the low of ₹637.7 and closed 2 per cent higher. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 200-day moving average support at ₹649 is holding well . Key resistances are at ₹663, ₹666 and ₹671. As long as Infosys trades above ₹649, a test of the above-mentioned hurdles is possible in the near term. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹671 will turn the outlook to positive and take the stock higher to ₹682 and ₹686. A further break above ₹686 will then pave way for the next short-term targets of ₹700 and ₹710. The stock will come under pressure if it breaks decisively below the 200-day moving average. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹630. A break below ₹630 can then drag it to ₹600 and ₹590. Traders who took short positions last week at ₹660 should remain cautious. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹675. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹655 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹645. Book profits at ₹630. 





RIL (₹1,125.8) 
RIL reversed sharply higher last week after making a low of ₹1,066.5 and closed 2 per cent higher. The upward reversal has happened from the 200-day moving average, which has been providing strong support for the stock since October. The near-term view is positive and RIL can move up to ₹1,180 and ₹1,185. The stock has been range-bound between ₹1,050 and ₹1,185 for more than three months now. Its ability to bounce higher every time it dips to the 200-day moving average keeps the bias positive . The possibility is also high of the stock breaking above ₹1,185. Such a break will take RIL initially higher to ₹1,205 or ₹1,210. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,210 will then boost the momentum and pave way for the next target of ₹1,275. Medium-term investors can go long at current levels and accumulate on dips at ₹1,095 and ₹1,070. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,025. The outlook will turn negative only if RIL closes decisively below the 200-day moving average support. In such a scenario, the stock can fall to ₹1,000 and ₹990.





Tata Steel (₹513.7) 
After inching higher for two weeks, Tata Steel reversed last week. Trading in the stock was subdued. It was stuck in a narrow range between ₹505 and ₹521 last week. The 21-day moving average at ₹519 is restricting the upside. A strong break and a decisive close above this hurdle is needed to ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹533 or even ₹539 over the short term. Inability to breach ₹533 or ₹539 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹520 and ₹518. But a strong break above ₹539 will boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹546 and ₹550. On the other hand, if Tata Steel remains below the 21-day moving average resistance, a fall to ₹505 or ₹500 is possible in the near term. A break below ₹500 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹480. A bounce from ₹480 can keep the stock range-bound between ₹480 and ₹530 for some time. But a decisive break below ₹480 can then drag Tata Steel lower to the crucial support level of ₹460."

SBI (297.5) 
SBI has been struggling over the last few weeks for strong follow-through buyers to take it decisively above ₹300. But, at the same time, the stock is also not attracting fresh sellers to drag it sharply lower. This leaves the bias bullish. The 21-day moving average at ₹289 is a key near-term support. As long as SBI trades above this support, the possibility of the stock breaching the ₹300-₹302 support zone is high. Such a break will take the stock higher initially to ₹310 and ₹312. A further break above ₹312 can then target ₹320 and ₹322. As mentioned last week, a crucial long-term resistance is poised around ₹322. As such, the price action around it will need a close watch to get a cue on the direction of the next move. The near-term view will turn negative if SBI declines decisively below ₹289. In such a scenario, a fall to ₹282 or ₹280 is possible. Traders who have taken long positions above ₹294 can hold it with a stop-loss at ₹282. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹307. Book profits at ₹318.





ITC (₹280.7) 
ITC was stuck in a sideways range between ₹277 and ₹284 last week. The resistance at ₹284 is continuing to cap the upside for the third consecutive week. A strong break above this hurdle is needed to ease the downside pressure for the stock. Such a break can take ITC higher initially to ₹287 and ₹290 — the next key resistance levels. If ITC manages to breach ₹290 decisively, the stock can gain momentum and target ₹296 and ₹300. But a pull-back from ₹290 can drag the stock lower to ₹285 and ₹280 again. On the other hand, if ITC continues to trade below ₹284 in the coming days and declines below ₹277, it can test ₹275 and ₹274. The outlook will turn completely negative if the stock breaks decisively below ₹274. In such a scenario, there is a strong likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹270 and ₹268. But the price action on the chart makes the bias bullish for ITC to break above ₹284. Medium-term investors who have taken long positions at ₹282 and ₹278 can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹262.





Infosys (₹660.7) 
Infosys seems to be lacking strength. The stock inched up in the initial part of the week but failed to sustain higher. Infosys made an intraweek high of ₹677 and came-off sharply giving up almost all the gains made during the week. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 200-day moving average at ₹650 is a crucial support to watch out for. If Infosys manages to sustain above this support, a bounce to ₹675 and ₹680 is possible in the near term. A strong break above ₹680 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹700 and ₹710 levels thereafter. The region around ₹710 is a significant resistance. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹710 is needed to turn the outlook completely to positive. Such a break will then pave way for the next targets of ₹750 and ₹760. On the other hand, if Infosys declines decisively below the 200-day moving average, it can come under renewed pressure. In such a scenario, a fall initially to ₹630 can be seen. A further break below ₹630 can then drag the stock lower to ₹600 and ₹590. 





RIL (₹1,099)
RIL has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹1,050 and ₹1,150 over the last one month. Within this range, the stock fell 2 per cent in the past week. A breakout on either side of ₹1,050 or ₹1,150 will determine the direction of the next move. The 200-day moving average support is at ₹1,069. A decisive close below this support will increase the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,050. A break below ₹1,050 will take RIL initially lower to ₹1,020. A further break below ₹1,020 will then increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹900 or even ₹980 thereafter. On the other hand, if RIL sustains above the 200-day moving average support, the bias will remain positive. A strong break above ₹1,150 will ease the downside pressure. The next targets are ₹1,190 and ₹1,200. A strong break above ₹1,200 will turn the outlook to positive and will pave way for a revisit of ₹1,250 and ₹1,300. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions taken at ₹1,125 and ₹1,095. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,025. 





Tata Steel (₹487.7) 
Tata Steel tumbled 5 per cent last week. The sharp fall last week indicates that the long-term downtrend in the stock is intact. Though there is a support near current levels at ₹480, Tata Steel looks vulnerable to break below it. A break below ₹480 can take the stock lower to ₹460. A further break below ₹460 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹430. Cluster of significant supports are poised in the broad ₹460-₹430 region. There is a strong likelihood of the current downtrend halting in this support zone. A strong upward reversal from this ₹460-₹430 support zone could be a good buying opportunity for investors with a long-term perspective. As such, the price action around the ₹460-₹430 support zone will need a close watch to get a cue on the next trend. On the other hand, if Tata Steel sustains above ₹480, a bounce to ₹500 or ₹510 can be seen. But the upside is likely to be capped as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels."
142,2019-01-08,Infosys,"IT sector: secular growth visible
TCS and Infosys are set to kick off the earnings season of Indian IT services companies this week. After a good run through the year so far, the sector is set to face some roadblocks. We look at how it may impact the third-quarter results.
“We expect growth acceleration in Q3, and for all top five IT service providers third-quarter year-on-year (y-o-y) growth should be better than second-quarter y-o-y growth. This is because of large deal wins in the last 12 months across the board, whose benefits will continue to accrue in Q3,” said Pareekh Jain, founder of Pareekh Consulting.
Despite fears of digitalisation cutting down deal sizes, IT companies in the past year were able to crack some of the largest deals in their history. TCS, for example, bagged three multi-year billion-dollar deals, totalling more than $5 billion in revenue since December 2017. Wipro in September won its largest ever $1.5 billion contract from Illinois-based Alight Solutions LLC, a deal spread over 10 years. HCL Technologies signed a five-year deal with Nokia worth over $500 million.
“Gradually improving y-o-y growth rates, anticipated continuum of the same in Q3, FY19 and a strong order book have all been indicators of secular strength in demand for IT Services. Growth is expected to continue accelerating into 3QFY19 (our estimate: 8.9 per cent y-o-y CC), contributed by good progress at each of the top five clients,” said analysts at brokerage firm Motilal Oswalin a note.
“We expect 11.7 per cent y-o-ygrowth at TCS — the highest among tier-I — while TECHM should lag with 4.7 per cent y-o-y CC growth, given sluggish momentum in Communications. We expect growth at INFO to accelerate to nine per cent y-o-y CC from 8.1 per cent in Q2, FY19,” the note added. 
The trade war between the US and China has already seen Apple lowering its revenue guidance for the year. This should be seen a warning sign for the overall IT services industry as growth slowing in the US will have a heavy impact on Indian IT in the long run. 
Analysts are expecting some commentary from the IT services companies on the impact of this likely slowdown in the US, as well as the ramifications of Brexit. The US continues to be the biggest market for the entire Indian IT industry, despite its efforts to expand presence in other geographies. 
“In our view, key monitorables for the street from the Q3 results are likely to be digital growth and deal size trends, outlook for key verticals including BFSI, Retail and Telecommunications and CY19 IT budget outlook. Apart from this, deal flows and order book are critical data points to watch out for,” Harit Shah, research analyst at Reliance Securities said. 
Reliance Securities expects the IT firms under its coverage universe to post a combined 1.4 per cent quarter on quarter rise in dollar revenue in the third quarter.
The rise of Indian currency could also reflect in the upcoming earnings report from the sector. 
Compared to Q2, Rupee appreciated about up to nearly three per cent against major currencies such as the US dollar, Euro, Pound Sterling and Australian dollar in Q3. 
“We expect 50-70 bps adverse impact of cross-currency movement in Q3, FY19 for top-tier IT firms, while for mid-tier IT firms, impact is seen at 25-45 bps,” Shah said. 
According to Reliance Securities, the top five IT firms are likely to post 0.7-2.1 per cent q-o-q dollar-revenue growth (1.3-2.6 per cent q-o-q in CC terms) with Tech Mahindra likely to lead the pack (2.1 per cent q-o-q dollar growth, 2.6 per cent CC growth). Among mid-sized firms, Persistent Systems is expected to out-perform with 6.6 per cent q-o-q dollar-revenue growth led by IP business seasonality, while Cyient is likely to trail (flattish revenue owing to weak DLM seasonality). 
Revenue growth is likely to come in at 2-9 per cent q-o-q, owing to Rupee depreciation, as per Reliance Securities.
On the margin front, Wipro is expected to post 200 bps EBIT margin expansion in its Combined IT Services business led by absence of one-time items and Rupee depreciation. 
Other top-tier firms are expected to post largely range-bound margins with some margin gains likely to be reinvested to sustain revenue growth, going forward."

India’s second largest IT services firm, Infosys, on Tuesday said its board will consider a buyback programme and payment of special dividend, among other proposals, at its meeting on January 11.
”...the board of the company will consider proposal(s), including but not limited to, buyback of fully paid-up equity shares of the company, payment of special dividend, implementation of the capital allocation policy at its meeting to be held on January 11, 2019,” Infosys said in a BSE filing.
The outcome of the board meeting will be disseminated to the stock exchanges after conclusion of the board meeting on January 11, 2019, it added.
The company is also slated to announce its third quarter results on January 11.
In April last year, the Infosys board had said it had identified an amount of up to Rs 13,000 crore to be paid to shareholders. This was done through a special dividend of Rs 10 per share that was to result in a payout of about Rs 2,600 crore in June 2018.
“Also, an amount of up to Rs 10,400 crore has been identified to be paid to shareholders for the financial year 2019 in a manner to be decided by the board,” it had said in its April 2018 filing.

138,2019-01-11,Infosys,"Infosys reports 30% drop in Q3 net
In a seasonally weak quarter, Infosys has revised its guidance upwards on the back of continued billion dollar worth deals and growth of the digital business. However, it has reported a 30 per cent drop in net profit to ₹3,609 crore due to a one-time hit on its Panaya and Skava acquisitions.
India’s second-largest software exporter gave a revenue guidance of 8.5-9 per cent, higher than the 6-8 per cent guidance which it had issued at the beginning of 2019 fiscal. Infosys also reported a 20.3 per cent growth in revenues to ₹21,400 crore on a year-on-year basis, which beat expectations of the street for the second consecutive quarter.
As expected, the company’s board cleared a buyback of equity shares worth ₹8,260 crore, the second in as many years, at a price not exceeding ₹800 per share. A special dividend of ₹4 per share has also been announced.
“We seem to be in a good position as our services are finding increased relevance among clients and I am happy I had a strong first year,” said Salil Parekh, CEO and MD.
While the revenues and guidance were positives, Infosys saw a big dip in profits on a yearly basis, due to a one-time hit on the Skava and Panaya acquisitions and persistently high sub-contracting costs.
The company, under the assets held for sale section, said that on de-classification, it has recognised additional depreciation and amoritisation expenses of $12 million and a reduction of $65 million in the value of Skava.
“We plan to repurpose Skava’s micro services based business and refocus on Panaya’s suite of products,” said Parekh.
BusinessLine was the first to report about Infosys’ plans to leverage Panaya and Skava’s licences and thereby keep them under its own fold.
Industry analysts said that this dip is largely due to increasing investments that the company is making to hire locals as stricter visa curbs in the US and other geographies are forcing IT companies to hire locally.
According to Harit Shah, Senior Research Analyst –IT, Reliance Securities, higher guidance and robust deal wins signify improving revenue visibility, even as cost pressures reflect on margins.
While Infosys has retained its operating margin guidance in the range of 22-24 per cent, at the end of Q3, margins were at 22.6 per cent, the lowest in the last six quarters. In the third quarter, Infosys also bagged large deals worth $1.57 billion.
Sanjeev Hota, AVP Research at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said that the increase in revenue guidance and better exit rate for fiscal 2019 provide comfort on double-digit growth in the next fiscal."

Infosys sprang multiple surprises in the December quarter, by delivering faster revenue growth than TCS, and also upped its FY19 guidance significantly. The numbers are heartening for investors, especially as the third quarter is usually a weak one for IT services players. An open market buyback of shares at a maximum of ₹800 apiece may evoke a positive reaction from the markets.
Robust increase in digital revenues, steady large-sized client additions, and traction in the key financial services segment are some key positive takeaways for Infosys during the quarter.
On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, the company reported a double-digit growth of 10.1 per cent, on a constant currency basis in dollar terms, after a gap of 10 quarters.
During the third quarter, the company’s revenues rose by 2.2 per cent sequentially in dollar terms (2.7 per cent in constant currency). TCS’ revenues grew by 0.7 per cent sequentially in the December period. The only dampener for Infosys, if at all, was the slip in operating margins. But Infosys’ operating margin of 22.6 per cent is still healthy and in line with the company’s preferred band of 22-24 per cent. TCS too had witnessed some erosion, with its margins coming in at 25.6 per cent, down sequentially.
 




 
Revenues derived from digital offerings grew by a robust 33.1 per cent y-o-y, and now account for 31.5 per cent of the overall pie, up from 26 per cent in the same period last year. The company has steadily climbed the digital ladder and has been able to tap significantly into client spends in this area.
The financial services vertical, which accounts for 32.5 per cent of Infosys’ revenues, grew at a healthy 3 per cent sequentially, faster than the company’s overall revenue rate. Manufacturing and energy and utilities segments grew at a much faster clip.
Infosys added one customer in the $50-million band and nine in the $10-million category during the quarter.
Overall, the company has witnessed fairly balanced growth during the period.
By increasing its guidance for revenue growth for FY19 to 8.5-9 per cent from 6-8 per cent earlier, Infosys looks set to match or exceed trade body Nasscom’s projected rate for the industry of 7-9 per cent.
Though an up-move is possible in the near term, any significant re-rating in the stock would depend on margins improving or staying steady and not getting eroded as the company chases large deals and revenues.
With TCS looking all set to record double-digit growth for FY19 and the likes of HCL Technologies too likely to do the same, the outlook for the IT services industry looks steady for the foreseeable future, a stark change from the pessimism that was prevalent in 2017."
136,2019-01-12,Infosys,"Infosys takes Panaya, Skava sale deal off the table 
 Infosys has dropped plans to sell Panaya and two other subsidiaries Skava and Kallidus after it failed to find any potential buyers.
In April, Infosys had announced its plan to sell Panaya -- the Israeli firm whose acquisition became a contentious issue between the founders and the erstwhile management led by Vishal Sikka -- along with Kallidus and Skava. It expected the sale to be completed by March 2019.
“During the quarter ended December 31, 2018, based on evaluation of proposals received and progress of negotiations with potential buyers, the company concluded that it is no longer highly probable that sale would be consummated by March 31, 2019,” Infosys said in a regulatory filing.
Accordingly, Panaya and Skava have been de-classified from “held for sale”, it added.
Infosys now plans to re-purpose Skava’s micro services-based business and re-focus Panaya’s suite of products.
Infosys said upon de-classification, it has recognised additional depreciation and amortisation expenses of $12 million and a reduction of $65 million in the carrying value for Skava. 
A whistleblower report in 2017 had alleged wrongdoings by Infosys and some officials in the $200 million acquisition of Israeli automation technology firm Panaya by the Bengaluru-based IT services firm.
An internal audit committee set up by Infosys found no evidence supporting the whistleblowers allegations.
However, Infosys founder N R Narayana Murthy had demanded that the full report by Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher on these whistleblower allegations be made public.
Later in October 2017, the Infosys board -- under its new chairman Nandan Nilekani -- gave a clean chit to the controversial Panaya acquisition, saying there was no merit in the allegations of wrongdoing.
It had also said that after a careful re-consideration it has concluded that putting out more details of the probe would inhibit the company’s ability to conduct effective investigations into any matter in the future. 
Infosys, in its Friday filing, also said the board has approved divesting the entire minority investment made by Infosys in Vertex Ventures US Fund I, LP for a total consideration of about $5 million, subject to fulfilment of necessary closing conditions. 
Infosys had invested in Vertex Ventures US Fund I, LP during financial year 2015."

Shares of Infosys on Monday rose by nearly four per cent after the company approved a Rs 8,260-crore share buyback and also raised its revenue growth forecast.
After a positive opening, shares of the company further gained 3.70 per cent to Rs 709 on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
At the National Stock Exchange (NSE), shares of the company jumped 3.90 per cent to Rs 710.20.
Infosys on Friday reported a 30 per cent drop in its December quarter net profit on higher expenses even as it approved a Rs 8,260-crore share buyback -- the second in less than 13 months’ time.
Its net profit slumped to Rs 3,610 crore in October-December 2018 from Rs 5,129 crore in the same period a year ago, the company said in a statement.
In spite of the drop in quarterly profit, the company raised its revenue growth forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2019 to 8.5-9 per cent in constant currency terms, from 6-8 per cent previously. Revenue from operations rose 20.3 per cent to Rs 21,400 crore.
Infosys said it will buy back 10.32 crore shares, or 2.36 per cent, for no more than Rs 800 per share -- 17 per cent higher than the closing price of Rs 683.70 per share on the BSE.
Infosys also declared a special dividend of Rs 4 per share.
Sanjeev Hota, AVP Research at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said that Infosys’ performance surprised positively with strong top-line growth for the quarter, though margin performance missed the mark.
“Increase in revenue guidance and better exit rate for FY19 provides comfort on double digit growth in FY20. Buyback quantum seems to be below than expectation, however, will support the stock performance in medium term,” he added."

 Infosys has hired over 7,600 staff in the US - more than three-fourth of its target of recruiting 10,000 American workers - and said it is making recruitment from local schools a “sustained effort” in its largest market.
“We have pretty much done 7,600-plus. We have opened five hubs now, we have announced six of them and we have opened five of them and we have hired 2,000 plus school grads - campus hires,” Infosys President and Deputy Chief Operating Officer Ravi Kumar said in a recent investor call. He added that the company is “on track on localisation”.
North America is the largest market for Infosys accounting for 60.4 per cent of the topline, followed by Europe (24.2 per cent), rest of the world (12.8 per cent) and India (2.6 per cent) at the end of December 2018 quarter. The Bengaluru-based company reported 20.3 per cent increase in revenue from operations at Rs 21,400 crore in the said quarter.
In May 2017, Infosys had announced that it will set up four technology and innovation hubs and hire about 10,000 locals in the US over a two-year period.
Infosys CEO Salil Parekh, who took over the top job last year, has outlined ‘localisation’, along with strategic investments and enhancing company’s digital capabilities as key areas of this three-year strategic plan. The strategy outlined focussed on stabilising the company’s business in 2018-19, building momentum the next year, followed by acceleration in 2020-21.
Kumar explained that Infosys has recruited from campuses, trained them, and then moved them into live projects. “This is a sustained effort, and as a part of our operating model, we would like to continue hiring in the US from schools, building a training infrastructure around it and then actually building a natural pyramid onsite as well. So, this is a sustained effort. It is going to continue as we go forward,” he said.
Infosys had announced setting up of technology and innovation hubs in Indianapolis (Indiana), Raleigh (North Carolina), Hartford (Connecticut), and Phoenix (Arizona). It is also establishing a design and innovation hub in Providence, Rhode Island.
Infosys, like many of its peers, has been ramping local hiring in key markets like the US, the UK and Australia to tackle increasing scrutiny around work visas by various governments. In November last year, Infosys said it will set up three innovation hubs in Australia and create 1,200 jobs in the country by 2020 - a move that will enable Infosys to co-create and co-innovate alongside clients, academia and government to accelerate innovation as well as upskill talent in emerging technologies and solutions."

 “I think we need to get a level-playing field between Indian and foreign investors. I am not against foreign investors getting advantages...But, it cannot be at disadvantage for the Indian investors,” said NR Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, while discussing how to stimulate Indian capital to enter the start-up sector.
“Today, it’s not a level-playing field. It is in favour of foreigners investing in India,” he said, speaking at the annual flagship event of TiE Mumbai. Murthy said only 10-12 per cent of the total funding that is being invested in India comes from the country.
He said while we are all for competition and want to welcome foreign money, our policies have not encouraged Indian entrepreneurs to get more funding. 
“In fact, we have requested the government to allow pension funds to invest in venture funds...We have requested them to make it more attractive for people to invest in venture capital funds.,” he said. 
Murthy said that moving forward, he hopes the government will make it more easier for Indian investors to put money in. Murthy also spoke about how times have changed, pointing out how attrition now is “much more than what we faced.” However, he said the ambitions are also higher these days. 
“It took us 12 years to go public. But now, neither you are happy nor satisfied. You want to go public even if you are not making profits. So your ambitions are higher, your challenges are much tougher than we faced. You are better warriors than we (were)”, he said."

Infosys will increase the size of its global internship programme, as it seeks to build a culturally diverse workforce in the face of the backlash against Indian outsourcing companies witnessed in the West.
Usually, under the InStep programme, 175 students would be shortlisted from universities across the world — notably from the Americas and other developed countries — and they would work on projects in India for a couple of months.
Addressing a gathering, Infosys’ co-founder NR Narayana Murthy congratulated Salil Parekh, the CEO, and said that for the first time in many years, the scope of the project has been expanded.
“Now we will take 250 or so,” he added. Parekh took over as Infosys CEO in January 2018 and industry watchers believe that by expanding the intake and scope of InStep, Infosys is continuing with Murthy’s and other co-founder’s vision that the programme, conceptualised 20 years ago, has to be a multinational brand in itself and at the same time build a multicultural workforce for the company around the world.
“This programme will give a chance to the interns to know India’s culture and the company’s philosophy,” said Murthy.
The report card of InStep so far makes for decent reading: 2,000 interns have taken part across 200 universities. Some of the interns have joined Infosys and work at its development centres in the US, Europe and Australia.
For the programme, Infosys has partnerships with the Carnegie Mellon University, Caltech and the University of California among others."

 The recent gains have been narrowly focused this year, with only a handful of stocks, including Reliance Industries Ltd and software exporters Infosys Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, driving the National Stock Exchange’s (NSE) Nifty 50 Index of India’s large caps. That advance has pared, and the gauge is almost back to flat. The benchmark S&P Sensex of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), on the other hand, is still about one per cent higher for 2019, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s gain is seven times stronger. 
As Prime Minister Narendra Modi frets about his upcoming re-election bid, here are other things that have also been on investors minds: A surprise interest-rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). 
While cheaper borrowing costs tend to be a good for stocks, one concern is they could hurt the exchange rate, pushing up inflation.
Some United States (US)-China trade jitters relayed in earnings. Debt concerns plagued conglomerates including IL&FS group, Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group as well as a bankruptcy filing by billionaire Anil Ambani’s wireless carrier and a sell-off that spread to other firms within his group.
In fact, setting aside short-term volatility expected around elections, the votes themselves are not expected to be a key driver for the long-term health of markets even if Modi gets ousted, according to analysts and investors.
Anand Radhakrishnan, Chief Investment Officer of equity at Franklin Templeton Asset Management India Pvt, said at a press conference in Mumbai last week that elections can only boost or dampen sentiment depending on the news flow, but they wont massively impact the underlying earnings and economic growth of the country.
The firm will continue to invest in India’s consumption, infrastructure and reform story for the next 20 years and is betting on banks, automobiles, consumer firms and software exporters to report good profit and revenue growth for the next few years.
“While the formation of a stable government is important for the sake of continuity, previous election cycles have shown neither growth nor reform stall if a government changes. Polls may pose a near-term risk for equities, but beyond that markets will focus on the trajectory of earnings. So far, 31 of the 45 Nifty 50 companies that have reported results this season have beaten or met analyst projections,” Societe Generale SA analysts Kunal Kundu and Rajat Agarwal said in a recent report.
There’s one technical indicator that could give investors something to get excited about. The Nifty 50s 50-day moving average is set to break above its 200-day line to form a technical indicator known as the golden cross. That’s typically seen as a bullish indicator.
At the moment, however, trade concerns are weighing on at least some corporate earnings.
Jaguar owner Tata Motors Ltd sank the most in 26 years on February 8 after reporting the biggest quarterly loss in India’s corporate history due to a slump in Chinas car market that’s affected automakers around the world. The decline dragged the Nifty 50 to a 1.1 per cent drop, its worst since December. On Monday, shares of Tata Motors took another hit after Jaguar Land Rover said that conditions aren’t right for it to borrow from the bond market and that its seeking alternative funding.
That said, India’s equities are otherwise still trending toward stabilization. The monthly average intraday move for the Sensex has slipped for a second straight month in February after spiking at the end of last year."

Infosys launched ‘InfyTQ’, a digital platform to offer learning and engagement experiences to engineering students in the country.


Infosys launched ‘InfyTQ’, a digital platform to offer learning and engagement experiences to engineering students in the country.

 The country’s second-largest IT services firm Infosys on Saturday announced the launch of ‘InfyTQ’, a digital platform to offer learning and engagement experiences to engineering students in the country. InfyTQ is a free platform open to all engineering students in their third and fourth years across India, Infosys said in a statement.
The platform encourages holistic development by imparting technical as well as professional skills, helping them become industry-ready, it added. InfyTQ, available on both mobile and desktop, includes content, courses, and news as well as online assessments and certification.
“With InfyTQ, students will benefit from the always-on, anytime, anywhere learning, catered through a continuous transfer of digital skills and expertise from the Infosys innovation ecosystem. The platform will also assist students to stay connected with the organisation, keep up with the latest happenings, and familiarise themselves with Infosys’ culture and value system,” it said.
The learning courses will be centered around conceptual and practical aspects of technology. This includes extensive hands-on learning to aid application of concepts in the real world. The platform will evolve and offer advanced learning materials and enable virtual programming environments for certain sets of students to further hone their technical skills, the statement said.
In addition, the platform also offers courses on professional skills to help students navigate the art of effective contextual response, inter-personal relationships, communication and e-mail, and etiquette, among others, it added."

IT employees (file photo).

As domestic IT players seek to deliver new-generation and digital services, they are looking beyond their in-house talent pools to hire sub-contractors and external professionals. They are willing to pay more for these sub-contractors as the crunch for qualified employees with new-age technical skill-sets gets intense.
Usually, most of these recruitments pertain to on-site (or overseas) locations, though hiring for external professionals happens for domestic operations, too. Issues related to H-1B visas in the US are also leading to an increase in such hiring.
Consider this: for TCS and Infosys, sub-contracting costs increased 25.6 per cent and 38.9 per cent respectively for the first nine months of FY19 compared to the same period in FY18, while their employee expenses rose only 18 per cent and 15.3 per cent respectively.
For mid-tier players such as Mindtree and Zensar Technologies, sub-contracting costs rose a whopping 59.3 per cent and 69.5 per cent respectively, even as their employee costs increased by less than half those levels.
Given that many new digital projects tend to be short-term or one-off in nature, it also helps IT firms to juggle talent based on client requirements.
“Sub-contracting costs have risen due to a combination of issues including the challenge in obtaining H-1B visas for sending employees from India and the crunch for local talent in the US,” says Ashish Chopra, Sr Group VP & IT Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
“While niche skill requirements can be fulfilled by hiring full-time employees, it may take more time, thereby causing a delay in the commencement of a project. Hence companies take recourse to sub-contractors to execute the projects in a timely manner.”
The increase in digital deals won by Indian IT vendors has accentuated the trend. “Digital contracts require on-site delivery and domain specific talent. Also, the size of the digital contracts is rising and so is the demand for talent,” says Amit Chandra, Analyst - IT, HDFC Securities. “Digital as a percentage of revenue for Indian IT firms is around 30 per cent and growing at 32 per cent YoY. Most of the large deals are in the transition stage and sub-contracting is the only option to the fulfil talent gap and timely delivery.”
Harit Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Reliance Securities, adds: “Shortage of trained digital workers is a bigger driver for hiring more subcontractors than the visa issue. Digital projects — whether one-off or slightly long term — need to be adequately staffed with skilled resources.”
Though hiring consultants or sub-contractors for a short duration would have the desirable effect of not adding to the employee count, it does not optimise costs for software vendors. Also, given that they bring niche skills to the table, their price tags are higher.
Chandra of HDFC Securities throws more light on this aspect: “There is a severe talent crunch in the US due to a huge demand for new-age programmers. There are many vacant positions and companies are hiring a lot of freelance programmers to fulfil the demand. The cost is $200,000-300,000, which is way higher than the average size of $90,000-120,000 for a programmer on an H-1B Visa,” he says, adding: “Sub-contracting costs as a percentage of sales have increased by 200-250 basis points and have impacted margins for IT firms.”"

Even as innovators come up with new ideas that can solve India’s social problems, funding remains a hurdle.
For Sudha Murty, Chairperson of Infosys Foundation, the last 12 months have been a journey and a reaffirmation of her belief that innovation need not be associated with sophisticated labs. “Innovation can come from an ordinary person with an empathetic mind and we have seen this across the country,” she told BusinessLine.
CSR funding
Indian software services majors, particularly Infosys, are among the early corporates that took to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) even before the government mandated large private and public sector firms to spend at least 2 per cent of their net profits on special development projects. The mandatory funding is applicable to corporates with a turnover of ₹1,000 crore or those reporting a profit of over ₹5 crore a year.
The government is hoping that with the help of corporates, many of the problems from healthcare to destitute care can be addressed in a meaningful manner. Infosys Foundation, as usual, has decided to rise to the occasion and identified six social sector areas, which it believes require immediate attention.
The Foundation has announced the winners of its Aarohan social innovation awards. From biodegradable sanitary pads to a low-cost prosthetic arm, a total of 12 awards were presented. The winners were given cash prizes of ₹5 to 30 lakh.
“India is a diverse country and many areas need fixing. Our effort is to identify some of the areas where the problems can be solved at scale,” said Murty. However, while the ideas pour in, funding them is still a problem area.
“These ideas require institutional support and they are doable,” Murty said.
As the foundation announced the innovation contest, it received 906 applications. Out of this, 30 were shortlisted and 12 were chosen finally. Some of the winners will get help in the form of an eight-week mentorship programme at IIT-Hyderabad to incubate and scale their ideas. The cost will be jointly borne by IIT-Hyderabad and Infosys Foundation.
Arvind Gupta, a toy inventor and science expert who was in the jury, said that having social innovators is not enough and there is a need to recognise and give them financial support.
Winning innovations
Entrepreneurs behind biodegradable sanitary napkins, a school bag that can double up as a writing desk, water-disinfecting handpumps, low-cost myo-electric prosthetic arm, an affordable Braille printer were among the winners this year.
Murty believes that the millennial Indian entrepreneurs are idealistic. “Some that I have come across had job offers from the US but preferred to work in India,” she said."
120,2019-02-28,Infosys,"Infosys reports ‘inadvertent trade’
Infosys on Thursday informed the bourses of the occurrence of an inadvertent trade by Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Lead Independent Director of the company, during open trading window period.
On February 13, it was brought to the attention of the Compliance Officer of Infosys that Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw had inadvertently, through her portfolio management services, sold 1,600 shares of Infosys without obtaining prior clearance. “The trade was carried out by the portfolio manager without the knowledge of Ms Mazumdar-Shaw,” Infosys said. The Audit Committee (AC), based on Mazumdar-Shaw’s submission, believes, that was an inadvertent trade made without intent to violate the insider-trading norms of Infosys and SEBI. However, the AC imposed a penalty of ₹9.5 lakh on Mazumdar-Shaw and said the amount should be paid to a charitable organisation of her choice."
119,2019-03-03,Infosys,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (272.9) 
SBI began the week on a weak note and fell about 2 per cent initially. However, the stock managed to reverse sharply higher from the low of ₹266.3, recovering all the loss. The price action on the charts over the last couple of weeks leaves the near-term outlook positive. A key support is at ₹267, which is likely to limit the downside. An upmove to ₹280 and ₹285 is likely in the near term. A cluster of resistances is poised in the ₹280-285 zone. Inability to breach this resistance region can drag SBI to ₹270 again. But a strong break above ₹285 will boost the momentum and increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹295 and ₹300 in the coming weeks. Short-term traders with a high-risk appetite can go long at current levels and accumulate at ₹269. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹265 for the target of ₹285. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹276 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹279. The 200-week moving average at ₹260 is a crucial support. The outlook will turn negative only if SBI declines below this support.





ITC (₹277.8) 
ITC has been stuck in the ₹273-284 sideways range for more than a month now. Within this range, the near-term outlook is bullish. ITC has risen and closed above the 21-day moving average at ₹276.5, which will now act as a good support. As long as the stock trades above this support, an upmove to ₹284 is possible in the near term. A pull-back from ₹284 levels will keep the sideways range intact and take the stock lower to ₹277-275 again. But a decisive close above ₹284 will mark the end of the sideways consolidation. It will then take the stock initially to ₹289. A further break above ₹289 will then trigger a fresh rally, targeting ₹301. The bullish outlook will get negated only if ITC breaks below 273. The next target is ₹265. But the price action on the chart keeps the bias positive and leaves the possibility high of the stock breaching ₹284 in the coming days. As such, investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at ₹282, ₹278 and ₹272. Retain the stop-loss at ₹262.





Infosys (₹741.1) 
Infosys surged to a high of ₹757.8, but later gave back most of the gains. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 21-day moving average resistance is at ₹747. A decisive close above it is needed to turn the outlook to positive. Such a break can take Infosys higher to ₹790 and ₹800. But as long as the stock trades below ₹747, a dip to ₹725 cannot be ruled out in the near term. A break below ₹725 will then take the stock lower to ₹710 or even ₹700 thereafter. However, a further fall below ₹700 looks unlikely. A cluster of supports poised between ₹710 and ₹700 is likely to limit the downside. An upward reversal from the ₹710-700 support zone will trigger a fresh rally to ₹745 and ₹750. A further break above ₹750 will then give rise to targets of ₹770 and ₹790. Medium-term traders can make use of dips to go long at ₹725. Accumulate longs at ₹720 and ₹715. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹680 for a target of ₹790. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹735 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹755. 





RIL (₹1,226.7) 
RIL inched lower for the third consecutive week. The 21-day moving average resistance at ₹1,248 continued to cap the upside in the stock for the second consecutive week. RIL can remain range-bound between ₹1,200 and ₹1,250 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹1,200 or ₹1,250 will decide the direction of the next move. A strong break above ₹1,250 can take the stock initially to ₹1,260. A further decisive break above ₹1,260 will boost the momentum and increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹1,300 and ₹1,320 in the short term. On the other hand, if RIL declines decisively below ₹1,200, the stock will come under renewed pressure. In such a scenario, RIL can fall initially to ₹1,175. A further break below ₹1,175 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹1,145. It will also confirm the head and shoulder reversal pattern on the daily chart. This is a bearish pattern, which may keep the stock under pressure. Investors can hold the long positions taken at ₹1,260, ₹1,245 and ₹1,225. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,180 for the target of ₹1,420.





Tata Steel (₹507.1) 
Tata Steel has been moving higher as expected, but at a slow pace. The stock was up 1 per cent last week. The short-term outlook continues to remain positive. A near-term resistance is at ₹517 — the 100-day moving average. A pull-back from this resistance can trigger a fall to ₹495 and ₹490. A further fall below ₹490 looks unlikely at the moment. An upward reversal from the ₹495-490 support zone will take the stock higher to ₹515 levels again. An eventual break above the 100-day moving average resistance will then increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹545 and ₹550 thereafter. The upmove from the January low of ₹442 is significant as it happened from the 200-week moving average support. Whether the current move is a trend reversal or just a corrective rally will become clear in the coming weeks. Short-term traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹502. Retain the stop-loss at ₹480 for the target of ₹545. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹510 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹517."
118,2019-03-03,Infosys,"Five of top 10 firms together add Rs 35,503 crore in m-cap 
Five of the 10 most valued Indian firms together added Rs 35,503 crore in their market valuation last week, with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) topping the chart among the gainers.
While TCS, ITC, Infosys, SBI and ICICI Bank witnessed a rise in their market capitalisation (m-cap) during the trading week ended Friday, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), HDFC Bank, HUL, HDFC and Kotak Mahindra Bank saw losses on the other hand.
TCS saw its valuation rise by Rs 24,671.93 crore to Rs 7,47,343.7 crore, positioning at the top of the ladder among the ten blue-chip firms.
ITC added Rs 4,328.83 crore to Rs 3,40,369.6 crore and Infosys’ valuation gained by Rs 3,407.55 crore to Rs 3,23,782.7 crore.
The m-cap of SBI jumped by Rs 1,963.41 crore to Rs 2,43,597.3 crore and that of ICICI Bank rose by Rs 1,131.27 crore to Rs 2,27,770.4 crore.
On the other hand, the market valuation of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) dropped by Rs 7,110.87 crore to Rs 3,75,555.8 crore.
HDFC’s valuation declined by Rs 4,344.84 crore to Rs 3,19,880.7 crore, and that of RIL fell by Rs 3,739.81 crore to Rs 7,77,564.2 crore.
The m-cap of Kotak Mahindra Bank dropped by Rs 2,757.11 crore to Rs 2,34,039.5 crore and that of HDFC Bank dipped by Rs 2,300.05 crore to Rs 5,67,036.2 crore.
In terms of the m-cap value of these top 10 firms, RIL stood at number one place, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, HUL, ITC, Infosys, HDFC, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank.
Over the last week, the BSE Sensex rose 192.33 points, or 0.57 per cent, to close at 36,063.81."

 Infosys on Thursday said it has been selected by Rolls-Royce Plc United Kingdom (UK) as one of its strategic long-term partners to deliver digital and engineering services.
As part of this engagement, Infosys will leverage its turbo machinery and propulsion practice to offer Rolls-Royce end-to-end complex engineering and digital solutions, Infosys said in a statement.
Infosys has extensive experience in delivering complex programs in aero and land-based gas turbines spanning component development, manufacturing technologies, service engineering, support, testing and validation services, it added.
No financial details of the partnership were disclosed.
“Through our engineering and digital services, we will support Rolls-Royce to become more productive, agile and innovative. We continue to invest in this exciting industry and in this partnership to support Rolls-Royce navigate towards transformation journey,” Infosys Executive Vice-President and Global Head (Manufacturing) Jasmeet Singh said.
Rolls-Royce has customers in more than 150 countries, comprising more than 400 airlines and leasing customers, 160 armed forces, 4,000 marine customers including 70 navies, and more than 5,000 power and nuclear customers."

Infosys had come under the lens of US authorities over visa issues on earlier occasions, too
   -  istock/subodhsathe

 A California court has cleared Infosys and Apple of wrongdoing with regard to visa-related abuse.
The US court dismissed a whistle-blower’s suit under the False Claims Act, which had accused Apple and Infosys of conspiring to have two Indian nationals enter the US on a B-1 business visa to provide training at Apple. 
This, the lawsuit had alleged, was in violation of immigration laws as the companies could have used the H1-B visa route, according to reports.
The lawsuit was filed by Carl Krawitt, a former contractor for Infosys. A B-1 visa is a temporary business visa.
Judge Lucy Koh dismissed Krawitt’s claim and the court came to the opinion that the trainer’s work under B-1 visa was acceptable and that neither Apple or Infosys was attempting to commit fraud.
The lawsuit also claimed that Infosys executives knew the company “lacked sufficient foreign nationals on H1-B visas to legally perform the classroom training sessions at Apple” that the company was contracted to provide, and that “only Indian foreign national workers on B-1 visas were available to perform services” for Apple at the time, the report said. 
The lawsuit had further alleged that Apple had drafted invitation letters for the US government for the B-1 visas without advising it of the training sessions, or that there would be “substantive work” involved. 
Instead, it had said the trainers would take part in “education meetings”. It claimed the same letters stated the trainers would not be paid, but they would in fact receive “trickle down compensation” from Infosys out of the firm’s fee. 
Apple countered that its trainers’ activities were permissible under B-1 laws and that there was no way to establish if it was done with intent, and that facts establishing the materiality of the invitation letters to the suit were questionable. Infosys shares closed at ₹718, marginally up from the previous day’s close.
This is not the first time Infosys has come under the lens of US authorities. 
Jack Palmer, another former Infosys employee, earlier blew the whistle on the software major’s alleged abuses, which triggered a US Federal government investigation. Eventually the case got dismissed by Federal judge Myron H Thompson. 
A similar lawsuit was filed by Satya Dev Tripuraneni, another Infosys employee, which got dismissed by the same Californian court. Infosys denied wrongdoing on all the occasions."

Infosys’s client acquisition momentum remained strong across verticals during Q3 FY19.

Infosys signs 14 large deals during the quarter, out of which 10 were in North America, three from Europe region and one from other region. This shows that key geographical regions regain the momentum.
Key verticals such as financial services, engineering and utilities and manufacturing segments showed strong growth. BFSI segment grew 3.6 per cent q-o-q, E&U and manufacturing vertical grew by 7 per cent while retail segment continued to be soft but management is confident on gaining momentum on account of healthy deal pipeline.

IT services major Infosys on Thursday said its consulting arm will pick 75 per cent stake in Stater NV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ABN Amro Bank NV that offers mortgage administration services in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, for €127.5 million (₹990 crore) in an all-cash deal.
ABN Amro, which is the third-largest bank in the Netherlands, will continue to hold the remaining 25 per cent of the shareholding, according to a press statement from Infosys.
Infosys Consulting Pte Ltd is the consulting arm of the IT major. The strategic partnership is in tune with Infosys’ strategy of strengthening its mortgage servicing capabilities in Continental Europe, the statement said.
Stater is a market leader in the Benelux region, operating across the mortgage and consumer lending value chain with capabilities in digital origination, servicing and collection.
Mortgage services is a focus area for large corporations in the financial sector, given the importance of the asset on a bank’s balance sheet. In a regulatory filing, Infosys said it will have the rights of a majority shareholder as part of the terms of the shareholders’ agreement.
This includes the right to appoint majority of directors in the supervisory board, right to subscribe to new shares and the right of first refusal in the event of transfer of shares.
“This transaction strengthens our approach to offer clients digital platforms and industry-focussed solutions. It brings together our complementary capabilities to enhance the value we offer to our financial services clients,” Mohit Joshi, President, Infosys, said in a press statement.
“While mortgages are a key product for ABN Amro, providing administrative mortgage services is not a core activity. That’s why we are very pleased with Infosys as Stater’s new majority shareholder,” Christian Bornfeld, Member of the Executive Board of ABN Amro, said.
The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, subject to customary closing conditions."

Infosys has announced strategic partnership with ABN AMRO by acquiring 75 per cent shareholding in Stater NV (a subsidiary of ABN AMRO) which provides pure-play, end-to-end mortgage administration services in Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
Infosys will pay €127.5 million (about $143 million) for the 75 per cent stake. (Expected closure: Q1FY20). Acquisition of Stater is in sync with Infosys strategy of strengthening its position in Continental Europe and we expect revenue for the business to be about $200 million with high single digit margin, implying valuation of about 1x EV/Sales. It will add about 1.6 per cent revenue growth and impact on EBIT margins will be 25 bps (assuming EBIT margins of 7 per cent) and will be marginally EPS-dilutive on FY20E. 
The inorganic strategy of Infosys will help them to accelerate revenue momentum. We expect 9.3 per cent dollar revenue and 10.3 per cent EPS CAGR over FY19E-21E. We have ‘Accumulate’ rating on Infosys and value at 18.5x Mar-21 earnings to arrive at a target price of ₹804."
109,2019-03-31,Infosys,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (320.8)
The uptrend in SBI is gaining momentum. The stock surged 7.6 per cent last week, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹305. Resistance is near current levels at around ₹321. A pull-back from that can trigger a corrective fall to ₹315. A break below ₹315 can drag the stock lower to ₹305. However, the bias continues to remain positive. So, a further fall below ₹305 looks less probable. A bounce from ₹305 will have the potential to take the stock above ₹321. In such a scenario, a rally to ₹350 is likely. The indicators on the charts are positive. The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 55-, 100- and 200-day moving averages. This is a strong bullish sign, indicating that the downside could be limited and the uptrend is likely to remain in place. Short-term traders can wait for dips and go long at ₹315 and accumulate at ₹308. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹295 for the target of ₹350. Revise the stop-loss to ₹325 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹335.





ITC (296.7)
ITC was volatile last week. The stock fell initially to a low of ₹291.2 and bounced back to make a high of ₹302.95. However, it fell in the final trading session of the week, giving back all the gains and closed on a flat note. The resistance at ₹302 is holding well. ITC has to make a decisive close above this hurdle to regain strength and move higher. The next target is ₹309. The level of ₹309 is a key long-term trend resistance. Inability to rise past this level can trigger a corrective fall to ₹302 or ₹300. But a strong break above ₹309 will increase the likelihood of the rally extending to ₹320 and ₹322 over the medium term. On the other hand, if ITC continues to trade below ₹302, a dip to ₹293 or ₹290 is possible. Investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at ₹282, ₹278 and ₹272 with a revised stop-loss at ₹289. Move the stop-loss further higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹305. Book profits at ₹310.





Infosys (₹742.3)
Infosys tumbled 3 per cent intraweek and made a low of ₹719.6. However, the stock reversed sharply higher recovering all the loss. The bias remains positive on the chart. The 21-day moving average at ₹726 is a key support. The quick bounce from ₹719 indicates that the stock is getting fresh buyers below ₹726. So as long as the stock trades above the 21-day moving average support, there is a strong likelihood of it moving higher to ₹750-₹755. A further break above ₹755 will then increase the likelihood of the uptrend extending to ₹780. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if Infosys makes a decisive close below the 21-day moving average. A fall to ₹705 or ₹700 is possible. A further fall below ₹700 looks less probable at the moment. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹725, ₹720 and ₹715. Retain the stop-loss at ₹680 for the target of ₹790. Revise the stop-loss to ₹735 as the stock moves up to ₹755.





RIL (₹1,363)
RIL opened the week with a gap-down and fell to a low of ₹1,317.15. However, the negative sentiment was short-lived and RIL clawed back, recovering all the loss and closed 1.5 per cent higher for the week. The support at ₹1,316 mentioned last week has held very well. This leaves the bullish outlook intact. A near-term resistance is at ₹1,385, which is likely to be tested in the coming days. Inability to breach this hurdle can drag the stock lower to ₹1,350 initially. A further break below ₹1,350 will then increase the likelihood of the downmove extending to ₹1,315 or ₹1,310. But, if RIL manages to break above ₹1,385, it can gain fresh strength. In such a scenario, RIL can surge to ₹1,400. A strong break above ₹1,400 will be very bullish from a long-term perspective. This will pave way for ₹1,450 and ₹1,500 over the long term. The outlook for the stock will turn negative only if RIL declines below ₹1,300. Such a break can trigger a corrective fall to ₹1,260 and ₹1,250.





Tata Steel (₹520.8)
Tata Steel continued to consolidate for the fourth consecutive week. The stock has been stuck between ₹505 and ₹532. A breakout on either side of ₹505 or ₹532 will decide the next move. If Tata Steel breaks the range below ₹505, it can fall to ₹495 or ₹490. But such a fall looks less likely as the price action on the chart leaves the possibility high of the stock breaking above ₹532. The stock is well above the 21-week moving average level of ₹507. As long as it trades above this support, the bias will remain positive. A strong break above ₹532 will take Tata Steel to ₹540. A further break above ₹540 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹560 over the medium term. Traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹518 and ₹512. Retain the stop-loss at ₹487 for the target of ₹555. Revise the stop-loss to ₹515 on a rally to ₹525.

Infosys on Monday said it has completed the formation of its joint venture with Hitachi, Panasonic Corporation and Pasona Inc, strategically enhancing presence in Japan.
In December last year, Infosys had announced its agreement with these partners under which Infosys was to acquire 81 per cent share in Hitachi Procurement Service Co, Hitachi’s fully owned subsidiary. Consideration for the 81 per cent stake was 2,762 million yen (approx Rs 174.58 crore).
Hitachi, Panasonic and Pasona are the minority shareholders of the entity.
HIPUS Co Ltd - the new venture - has named Shinichiro Nagagata as chief executive officer (CEO), Infosys said in a statement.
The JV will be headquartered in Japan, and more than 200 employees will be part of it on establishment.
“The joint venture, formed by complementary, iconic companies coming together, will accelerate business process transformation leveraging digital procurement platforms for the local and global needs of Japanese corporations,” the statement said.
It added that Infosys will bring its global expertise in procurement processes, consulting, analytics and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic process automation (RPA) to the venture.
Combined with Hitachi and Panasonic’s knowledge of their procurement functions and local teams, and Pasona’s human capital and BPM networks in Japan, the entity will provide end-to-end, efficient and high value procurement capabilities to corporations."

106,2019-04-07,Infosys,"Three of top 10-companies add Rs 40,597 cr to m-cap 
 Three of the 10 most valued firms together added Rs 40,597 crore in market valuation last week, with TCS emerging as the biggest gainer.
From the top-10 pack, TCS, HDFC and Infosys saw gains to their market capitalisation (m-cap) for the week ended Friday, while Reliance Industries (RIL), ITC, HUL, HDFC, SBI, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank suffered losses. The cumulative gains of TCS, HDFC and Infosys were higher than the total loss suffered by the seven firms, which stood at Rs 30,758.64 crore.
The m-cap of TCS soared by Rs 19,155.92 crore to Rs 7,69,782.96 crore. HDFC’s valuation surged Rs 15,346.61 crore to Rs 3,54,004.99 crore and that of Infosys jumped Rs 6,094.66 crore to Rs 3,30,400.44 crore.
In contrast, the m-cap of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) slumped by Rs 10,412.23 crore to Rs 3,59,275.99 crore.
ICICI Bank’s valuation dived Rs 5,376.90 crore to Rs 2,51,729.21 crore, and that of RIL tumbled Rs 5,039.26 crore to Rs 8,58,956.4 crore.
The m-cap of HDFC Bank eroded by Rs 4,016.88 crore to Rs 6,26,837.10 crore, and that of SBI dropped by Rs 3,391.35 crore to Rs 2,82,910 crore.
ITC suffered an erosion of Rs 2,513.02 crore to Rs 3,61,200.58 crore, while Kotak Mahindra Bank’s valuation reduced by 82.09 crore to 2,54,783.55 crore.
In the ranking of top-10 firms, RIL stood at number one position, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, ITC, HUL, HDFC, Infosys, State Bank of India (SBI), Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank.
During the week, the Sensex advanced by 182.32 points, or 0.48 per cent and the Nifty gained 42.05 points, or 0.36 per cent."
105,2019-04-12,Infosys,"Will Q4 of Infosys, TCS surprise street?
Friday will be the big day for this results season as two IT biggies - TCS and Infosys, will declare their fourth quarter earnings. Analysts expect Infy to report 2-3 per cent revenue growth and 8-12 per cent PAT growth sequentially for Q4 FY19.
Analysts also expect TCS to report its constant currency revenue growth of nearly 2 per cent q-o-q but a marginal decline in profit. Besides numbers, analysts will monitor the FY guidance and management comments."
104,2019-04-12,Infosys,"Infosys profit rises 10.5% to ₹4,078 cr
Infosys reported steady growth and beat its guidance in fiscal 2019, but sacrificed margins for the fourth straight quarter and gave a conservative guidance.
India’s second largest software exporter gave a guidance of 7.5-9.5 per cent in constant currency for fiscal 2020.
The IT major’s net profit in FY19 stood at ₹15,404 crore, down 3.9 per cent from the ₹16,029 crore recorded in FY18. The fall in profit was attributed to the adjustment for expenses incurred as a result of write-downs in its subsidiaries such as Panaya, Skava and DWA Nova, some of which was carried over from FY18.
Salil Parekh, who completed his first year as CEO, assured that the overall business is more stable and Infosys is better positioned in its digital business. When Parekh took over, he outlined a three-year strategy for the company — in the first year it was about stability, and then followed by building momentum and finally accelerating the business.
In the first year under Parekh, Infosys bagged total contracts worth $6.28 billion; in the fourth quarter it won contracts worth $1.57 billion.
While the guidance was seen mostly in line with what the market expected, analysts gave a thumbs down to the operating margins, which stood at 21.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, a dip of 100 basis points (1 per cent). New CFO Nilanjan Roy said the reason for the dip in margins is due to continued investments made in hiring in the US, re-skilling as well as hiring digital talent. For the whole year, margins came in at 22.8 per cent, in line with its 22-24 per cent guidance it had given in the start of the fiscal.
Sanjeev Hota, AVP Research at Sharekhan, said that it was a mixed performance, with marginal improvement in revenues and a miss in margins.
Harit Shah, Senior Analyst, Reliance Securities, said that while the deal wins were healthy, revenues from the financial services and retail sectors were poor. However, Infosys COO Pravin Rao said that out of the 13 large deals won, three were in financial services sector.
For the March-ended quarter, Infosys posted a net profit of ₹4,078 crore, a 10.5 per cent growth over the ₹3,690 crore posted in the year-ago period. Revenues came in at ₹21,539 crore, a 19.1 per cent increase when compared to ₹18,083 crore in the same period.
Infosys also continued to battle attrition, which was 20.4 per cent, some that analysts considered as a negative. Rao said that various initiatives such as milestone-based incentives and more career opportunities are being given to employees and the aim is to being attrition down to 13-15 per cent levels."

In a departure from the past year, entry-level hiring is robust in India’s top two software exporters.
TCS and Infosys, which both posted their annual results today, said that net additional hires for the year were more than 50,000. 
TCS hired 29,287 employees and Infosys hired 24,016 techies in the 2018-19 fiscal. 
TCS total employee headcount was 4,24,285 and Infosys closed 2019 fiscal at 2,28,123 employees.
In comparison, both the IT majors added a total of around 11,000 employees in 2018 fiscal.
Further, Infosys said that it has crossed 10,000 employees in the US, which includes re-badging of people. Re-badging is industry terminology for transferring people from a customer to an incoming supplier for projects.
Other software exporters, such as Wipro, HCL and Cognizant are expected to announce their results this month. 
This development comes in the backdrop of IT companies handing out pink slips in 2017-18 as a result of lack of projects, automation, migration to cloud computing and others.
The shake-up has passed, and it augurs well for the future, said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder, TeamLease and President, Indian Staffing Federation.
Industry watchers believe that the transformation of Indian software exporters, coupled with success in digital business are some of the reasons for this uptick in hiring. 
Also, the IT sector has performed well in the past 12 months on the back of currency tailwinds with the Dollar hitting the 70 mark recently.
“The market is definitely better off this year when compared to the last one,” said Kris Lakshmikanth, CEO, Head Hunters India.
A bulk of the hiring is happening at the entry-level, according to industry watchers. According to a cutshort.io report, Bangalore, Pune, Delhi and Hyderabad constitute roughly 65 per cent of the talent pool of full stack developers.
“Also, with this hiring numbers, companies are showing that they are seeing confidence in the near future and this is an effort to beef up the bench,” said Lakshmikanth.
Infosys has also doled out 2,500 promotions. Salary hikes offshore were 6 per cent, and onsite hikes were in the range of 1-1.5 per cent, said COO Pravin Rao."
102,2019-04-12,Infosys,"Infosys, TCS post strong numbers in a usually weak fourth quarter
In a seasonally weak March quarter, the top two IT majors — TCS and Infosys — delivered a robust set of numbers. 
The revenue growth of both the companies was healthy. 
While TCS scored in terms of broad-based traction across key verticals, Infosys reported solid additions to its list of large-sized clients.
Both companies have also reported healthy digital revenues. 
The one aspect that may leave the markets disappointed is the decline in the operating margins recorded by the IT majors.
During the fourth quarter, Infosys’ revenue grew 2.4 per cent sequentially in dollar terms, while TCS reported a 2.8 per cent increase in sales.
The operating margins stood at 25.6 per cent for TCS and at 21.5 per cent for Infosys, a sequential dip of 40 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively.
Digital revenues grew at a solid pace of 46.4 per cent year on year (YoY) for TCS and at 41.1 per cent for Infosys during the March quarter. 
This steady growth indicates that both the companies majors have been able to tap the digital spends of clients on a significant scale.
During the period, Infosys managed to add two clients to the $100-million bucket and one in the $50-million category. 
TCS reported additions only in the relatively smaller bands of $20 million and $10 million. However, the company witnessed broad-based growth across various verticals including banking and financial services, retail, communication and manufacturing, which reported faster growth compared to the company’s overall revenue rate. 
Infosys’ growth, on the other hand, was more narrowly led, with only the communication and hi-tech verticals reporting solid traction.
Attrition, which was at 20.4 per cent during the quarter, continues to rise for Infosys 
For TCS, attrition was recorded at 11.3 per cent.
Infosys ended FY19 with a revenue growth of 9 per cent, while TCS finished with an 11.7 per cent growth in sales.
With a strong deal momentum, Infosys does look set to meet the upper end of its revenue guidance (7.5-9.5 per cent) for FY20. 
With TCS too appearing on course to achieving double-digit growth in the new fiscal, the IT industry is likely to be on a high for the next year or so. 
Of course, the margins could come under pressure while chasing large deals. 
However, there still appears to be considerable headroom to manoeuvre for the top two players.
TCS continues to command premium valuations, trading as it does at over 25 times its trailing 12 months per share earnings.
Infosys has delivered well under the new management for much of 2018-19. 
But it may take a couple of more quarters of solid performance from Infosys — which trades at a price-earnings multiple of 21 times — before markets accord the company the same valuation multiple that it assigns to TCS."
101,2019-04-14,Infosys,"Visa case: Former US employee of Infosys files an appeal for review in California court 
  A former Infosys employee in the US, whose lawsuit against the company for alleged visa fraud was thrown out last month, has now filed a notice of appeal at the District Court of California. A notice of appeal is filed to review a case.
According to filings in courtlistener.com, a non-profit legal search engine, a federal court judge in San Jose in March left the door open for Carl Krawitt — who had filed the lawsuit — to submit an amended complaint if he wished to, after dismissing his case. Krawitt had alleged in his case that Infosys had conspired to bring in Indian employees on B-1 business visas as trainers for a six-week programme at Apple though, as per legal requirements, they could only be brought on H-1B visas, which are tougher to get.
An official statement from Infosys is awaited. The company has three days to counter the notice.
Krawitt, who earlier worked with Infosys as a contractor, is understood to have made the case as a whistleblower and on behalf of the federal government. The San Jose court dismissed the case under the False Claims Act. Earlier, the California court cleared Infosys and Apple of wrongdoing, saying a trainer’s work under B-1 visa was acceptable and that neither firm had attempted to commit a fraud.
 Apple claimed that there was no case to establish that this was done with intent.
This allegation is similar to ones made in the past, most notably by Jay Palmer, another former employee who first blew the whistle on Infosys. Palmer had alleged visa-related abuses, which triggered a US Federal government investigation. Eventually, the case got dismissed by federal judge Myron H Thompson. 
According to recent United States US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, Infosys topped H-1B visa denials in FY18, ending September 2018, with more than 25 per cent of its 8,000-plus applications rejected. 
Further, according to a CARE ratings report, the top five tech companies suffered a 49 per cent drop in H-1B petitions being approved in FY2018 compared to the previous fiscal."
100,2019-04-15,Infosys,"Infosys falters on weak FY20 guidance; TCS rises
Shares of Infosys Ltd fell as much as 4.7 per cent to Rs 712.6, marking its sharpest daily drop since October 11, on weak FY20 margin guidance.
The software services exporter forecast an operating margin of 21-23 per cent for FY20, after reporting a 10.4 per cent rise in Q4 profit on Friday.
Wells Fargo has called the guidance 'light'; says the operating margin guidance was below its expectation of 22-24 per cent. It adds that revenue growth guidance of 7.5-9.5 per cent may be a touch below what the Street was looking for.
Investec had downgraded the stock to 'hold', and had cut TP to Rs 750 from Rs 784 earlier. Nomura says margin risks remain, and has downgraded Infosys to 'reduce' from 'neutral'.
The stock was a drag on the NSE index, which is up 0.21 per cent as of 0353 GMT.
Shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) gained nearly 4 per cent after the company reported 17.7 per cent growth in consolidated net profit for the March 2019 quarter. The scrip after making a positive opening further jumped 3.56 per cent to Rs 2,085.60 on the BSE. At the NSE, shares of the company rose by 3.64 per cent to Rs 2,088.
On the volume front, one lakh shares of the company were traded on the BSE and over 28 lakh shares on the NSE, during the morning trade. “TCS beat street/our estimates on revenues,” Emkay Global Financial Services said in a report on Saturday.
TCS Friday reported 17.7 per cent growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 8,126 crore for the March 2019 quarter. This is against a net profit of Rs 6,904 crore in the year-ago period, TCS said in a regulatory filing.
Revenue of the firm grew 18.5 per cent in the quarter under review to Rs 38,010 crore from Rs 32,075 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal, it added."
99,2019-04-23,Infosys,"Huawei, Infosys ink partnership pact for cloud computing business 
 Chinese telecom company Huawei’s business arm, Huawei Cloud, and IT firm, Infosys, on Tuesday signed a memorandum on strategic cooperation to jointly develop solutions around cloud computing services for business organisations.
“Huawei Cloud and Infosys today signed a memorandum on strategic cooperation to help enterprise customers transition quickly to the digital cloud,” a joint statement by the companies said.
The cloud computing system helps entities use software, store data and other IT related work without the need to buy complete software or hardware that they may need for computing purposes.
As part of the agreement, Infosys will join the Huawei Cloud Partner Network (HCPN) and the two companies will develop new cloud solutions leveraging Huawei Cloud and Infosys products and services to help customers securely adopt cloud-based systems for their enterprise workloads, the statement said.
“We hope to further expand the HCPN partner ecosystem by identifying and developing partners such as Infosys with deep consulting expertise,” Edward Deng, president of Huawei Cloud Global Market, said.
By the end of 2018, the number of HCPN partners were more than 6,000 and through cooperation with these partners, Huawei Cloud has added 2,800 applications that are available in 23 geographical regions across the globe, including the Asia-Pacific, China, Russia, and South Africa.
“As part of this engagement, we will provide a suite of technologies hosted on Huawei Cloud, such as workload migration solutions, including SAP and other enterprise workloads,” Infosys President, Ravi Kumar S, said."

Aritificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are not just jargon bombarding the IT space. They are bringing about a huge transformation among businesses and the society alike. While AI has a positive impact on businesses, it is also seen as a threat to jobs. S Gopalakrishnan, co-founder, Infosys, and chairman, Axilor Ventures, spoke to  BusinessLine about the impact of AI on jobs and building a career around the technology. Excerpts:
How do the new technologies transform the society?
In sectors such as healthcare, technology will reduce the need for specialists, and can even enable a robotic surgery. It positively impacts the common man, providing better healthcare in remote areas where specialists are not available. 
In financial services, credit rating, or loan applications processing, better customer service or fraud detections can be done by many applications. We need to invest in understanding and leveraging the new technologies to our advantage. 
We can also provide better customer service to citizens in vernacular languages and support farmers using AI- and ML-based tools.
How will people adapt to the changing technology?
A good society adjusts to the changing circumstances. We cannot prevent or halt the progress of technology; it can only be slowed down. We need to manage the consequences. 
I entered the job market in 1979, which was the start of the computer revolution in India. Since then, we have created four million jobs. IT services today is a $170-billion industry. And, it did not exist before the 1980s. 
Is skilling people proving to be a challenge?
While tech-awareness is high, we need to train and retrain people in new technologies. I am very optimistic about the learning ability of our people. Adaptability is one of India’s strengths.
We need to ensure that there the training capacity. Every 5-10 years, a person needs to go through retraining. This is a new phase, but our academic institutions are not prepared, the society is not prepared, and funding is a challenge. 
We introduced programming at schools when the digital computer revolution happened. Similarly, we need to introduce AI/ML concepts at schools to start with, followed by programmes at colleges and at research levels.
Will AI/ML create or take away jobs?
The answer is both yes and no. Some jobs will disappear. For example, the job of a loan officer in a bank would be better done by a machine, and only in exceptional cases, human intervention is required. Driver-less vehicles will take away the job of the drivers. However, new jobs will be created. There is demand at all levels in new technologies to create tools and IPs. We need professionals to apply these tools. New business models are emerging.
Can you give some examples of emerging business models?
A BPO company has recruited nearly 3,000 people to certify images in social media. When a person loads a picture to social media, the image is checked to ensure that it is not hurting the sentiments of people, or has pornographic content. Such new jobs are created continuously. 
As new technologies come, there will be requirement for people in the area of data cleansing, data massaging and training machines.

97,2019-05-03,Infosys,"Digital is the main growth engine for Infosys: CEO Salil Parekh
It has been over a year since Salil Parekh took over as Infosys CEO & MD after a tumultuous period which saw the sudden exit of Vishal Sikka from the high profile job.
Since then, stability seems to have returned at Infosys which made the non-executive chairman, Nandan Nilekani, remark recently that it has become boring. In an interview with BusinessLine , Parekh, 54, shares his vision for the company and about the future of the domestic IT industry. Excerpts:
What has changed over the past one year in Infosys since you took over?
We have had a phenomenal year in FY19. We have increased our client relevance. Our digital business is growing at over 30 per cent. The clients are starting to see Infosys in a positive light. Digital is growing rapidly and has now become 34 per cent of our business. It is the main growth engine within the company.
We are now building a business for the next 10 years. We are re-skilling our employees; executing on building localised workforces in all countries, and building fully agile workspaces in our main locations in India. All this shows us which path we should take.
What are the things that you had to let go to get into this kind of phase?
Last April, we announced in the market about our strategic direction. It was all about where our clients are driving their business. Clients are driving two main types of activities today - one is the growth agenda that is centred around how do we get digital technologies to help them. So, our main strategic direction was to drive digital investments for clients' digital growth and improve automation so that they come to us. It was not so much letting go, it was about really putting much more intensity in the sales process. We pushed a lot into large deal programmes, into account expansion programmes, into a new client acquisition program. Those three types of programs and the sales intensity has helped us to build some momentum within our business line today.
You came from a large corporation. Any learnings from there that you have brought to Infosys?
There were a lot of learnings of how IT services work. Infosys has a huge strength in delivery. Clients really respect us because they believe that Infosys’ strength lies in deep delivery capability. We need to show the clients that we are building what is important for their future.
Work doesn’t come to Bangalore. We have to go there and make sure that they realise that you are in the game. About 60 per cent of our clients are in the US, 25 per cent in Europe and that’s where all the activity is, in terms of engagement with clients. It isn’t like sitting here in Electronic City and clients giving you work. Those are long gone.
Are there still any internal challenges, like the high attrition rate for example? What is the kind of message that is being conveyed to the middle and top-level executives?
We can improve how we are running our business, our recruitment process, sub-contracting process or our fulfilment process, through some of the attrition elements, through utilisation elements. So, on an operational basis, we have a lot of levers that we can improve upon to make the business more efficient in the future. The messaging, if you look first at the leadership team which is driving a go to market it is very stable. We have had the same team now driving the business, we have split that into five segments. On the delivery side also, all of our top service line leaders have a very clear sense of where they are driving the company. We have already made some changes in the re-skilling and compensation programme, but all of these will take time as we go through the whole company. We are hoping to improve all these operational measures, in the next few quarters to come. We see the growth in better shape.
What are the reasons for the high level of attrition and how do you plan to tackle it?
Our attrition level in Q4 or Q3 is lower than what was at the start of the year. Even four or five years ago, it was higher than what we see in our competitors.
Infosys has always believed in training for employees. We put graduates through intense training which makes them very attractive to some of our competitors. Having said that, we still want to improve and reduce the attrition level.
Has the engagement with clients changed, especially because of more focus on protectionism in the US?
I think the way it has worked today is that our clients are still engaged with Infosys. On the political side, we put in a newer approach where we are recruiting within the US, Europe, Australia and the Asia-Pacific (APAC). But overall business environment is not affected by this. We are also building a resilient business model, independent of what the situation is in Europe, the US or Asia.
In the past, there have been issues regarding with regard to whistleblower complaints and acquisitions going wrong. What are the things that need to be done to ring fence Infosys from such situations repeating themselves?
We want to carry out future acquisitions in a manner that makes it easier for everyone to follow what is going on. The board is very supportive of all of the acquisitions. We have a strategic direction based on that and at the same time we have to be careful to see that the integration is working well. We have to make sure that we put in people from Infosys into these companies in every key positions and make sure that it integrates into our existing service lines.
You did mention the fact that 34% of your total business comes from Digital. To accelerate the growth there, will you look at more acquisitions? 
I think we have a good portfolio and there is always a way to accelerate it. So, to accelerate some of those things we are still looking to do more acquisitions in the digital space. There are growth areas on the cloud, software, service, and cyber-security areas.
Down the road, there is this mid-tier IT company which faces a hostile takeover bid. This doesn’t quite happen in the domestic IT industry. Do you think this will form a template for future acquisitions in the industry?
There are 2,000-3,000 small players. So, it is not that easy to consolidate because of the cultural element. Those forces will play up if you get the right combination of things, and you have the right management teams, but it is not as straight forward as it looks. When you bring any two companies that are different culturally, there could be some issues.
While topline growth is comforting, Infosys is struggling to arrest its margin downtrend. Are you consciously sacrificing margins to drive growth?
If you look at FY19, the key question is on pricing. Pricing will remain more or less stable or slightly improved throughout the year.
What we have done, in terms of the approach for FY‘19 is to put money into areas on building digital capabilities, sales capabilities, large deals, into re-skilling, localisation and into some compensation adjustments which had not happened for some time. Then we have some operational levers, in terms of utilisation, in terms of sub-contractors, in terms of how we are doing our recruitment... With that, we feel fairly confident, that the guidance we’ve given is where we are going to end up.
If you look at the core applications business it has been falling for three quarters now. Is digital coming at the cost of the core?
Our core business in FY‘19 is still growing, slower than 30 per cent but it is still growing. If you look at some of our competitors, most of their core business is shrinking. That is because we have a very strong story on delivery, and on automation, and that gives us a real competitive advantage with respect to some of our competitors, our core business is still holding.
What feedback have you received from the co-founders?
Nandan (Nilekani) is a strategic thinker. I discuss various issues with him but he does not monitor day-to-day operations.
Has he talked to you about leaving the company?
I have not discussed it with him on this. He seems to be enjoying himself, the rest you ask him."
96,2019-05-03,Infosys,"A spike in hiring marks the March quarter for IT majors
Top Indian IT services companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Cognizant and Infosys — have significantly increased their net employee additions during the March quarter, compared to the same period last year.
Wipro, however, bucked the trend with a contraction.
 





 
The improved hiring is in the backdrop of anticipated business growth and higher attrition rate — in the range of 10-20 per cent .
TCS led the pack in hiring, followed by Cognizant and Infosys.
“To support our growth, we continue to tap into talent pools across the world and add to our ranks. During this quarter, we added 6,356 employees on a net basis, bringing the total net addition for the year to 29,287. Our focus on diversity and inclusiveness continues to yield results,” V Ramakrishnan, CFO, TCS, had told analysts.
Salil Parekh, CEO and MD, Infosys, had said : “I think the overall demand environment is strong and therefore, the talent availability is constrained across the board, especially in the US. We have been able to fulfil the demand through fairly aggressive recruitment.” Over 50,000 new hires join the company in fiscal 2019, he had told analysts.
“We ramped up hiring in fourth quarter — and then in the beginning of March quarter — for the anticipated growth this year. It is hard to pull down the hiring. But once you have people on board you need the revenue to provide support,” Karen McLouhglin, CFO, Cognizant Technology Solutions, told analysts."

 The combined market valuation of six of the 10 most valued Indian companies plunged by Rs 64,219.2 crore last week, with IT giant TCS suffering the biggest drop.
ITC, HUL, Infosys, SBI and ICICI Bank were the other firms which witnessed a slide in their market capitalisation (m-cap) for the week ended Friday, while Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), HDFC Bank, HDFC and Kotak Mahindra Bank finished with gains.
The m-cap of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) slumped Rs 39,700.2 crore to stand at Rs 8,00,196.04 crore.
HUL’s valuation tumbled Rs 11,029.2 crore to Rs 3,66,441.16 crore and that of Infosys dropped Rs 5,832.53 crore to Rs 3,16,201.41 crore.
The market cap of ICICI Bank eroded by Rs 3,558.82 crore to Rs 2,59,087.06 crore and that of SBI declined Rs 2,811.25 crore to reach Rs 2,75,904.37 crore. ITC’s valuation fell by Rs 1,287.15 crore to Rs 3,72,172.06 crore.

94,2019-05-08,Infosys,"‘Fit will drive acquisitions at Infosys’
Infosys, which was in the news for the wrong reasons with its acquisition of Panaya in 2015, will decide on future buys based on their fit with existing service lines, a top company executive told BusinessLine. 
According to him, the acquisitions will be done in a manner that will make it easier for everyone to follow. He said the board is extremely supportive of this new strategy. 
 Apart from focusing on the integration aspect, the management will ensure that key decision-makers in the company after acquisition are from Infosys, especially on the business and finance verticals, he added. 
“We will make sure that it (the buy) integrates with our existing service lines. How this will play out is difficult to say; but if we follow these steps, hopefully, we could see to that it is done in a somewhat structured manner,” the executive said. 
These statements come in the backdrop of the controversy surrounding the acquisitions made during the tenure of the previous CEO Vishal Sikka. 
Infosys, under Sikka, acquired Israeli company Panaya in 2015 for $200 million. 
However, a whistle-blower had alleged payment of “hush money” to certain stakeholders. In August 2017, Sikka quit the company and Salil Parekh took over the next year. 
Infosys is currently looking at acquisitions in the digital space and in the cloud and cyber-security areas. 
“I think we have a good portfolio, and there is always a way to accelerate it. So, we are looking for more acquisitions in the digital space,” the top official said.
He said the company is definitely looking at several areas on the digital side and some other which are more of a mix of digital and core services which are larger in size. The company also does not want to be excessively aggressive on acquisitions. 
“They have to make sense, in terms of the price and the culture. Once all parameters fall into place, I think we will do it,” he said.
Infosys has made two small acquisitions in the past year in the digital space across Europe and the US. 
Industry watchers believe that the company needs to up the ante. “They have to acquire in digital, and even though it is a bit late, it is better than never,” said Kris Lakshmikanth, CEO, Headhunters India.
However, the acquisitions need to be thought through at a time when margins are coming down. 
Aniket Pande and Rajat Gandhi, Analysts, Institutional Equities at Prabhudas Lilladher, are cautious about margin expansion due to higher compensation and continued investments though they are confident about Parekh’s leadership and his execution skills.
 Infosys’ margins were at 21.5 per cent in the March-ended quarter, and the management has lowered the guidance to 21-23 per cent for fiscal 2020, from 22-24 per cent in the previous fiscal.
Infosys is also building a business model which is more resilient for the future, independent of what the situations are in the US, Europe or Asia. The company is also accelerating the hiring process with a number of locals being recruited."

Resistance may cap upside in SBI
SBI (₹308.05)





SBI tumbled over 5 per cent intra-week, breaking below the key support level of ₹302. However, it clawed back from the low of ₹292.2, recovering almost all the loss after the fourth-quarter results announcement on Friday. Though the weekly candle gives a mixed signal, the daily chart is relatively positive. A key support is at ₹302, which can limit the downside; resistance is at ₹313. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹321-322. A pull-back from ₹322 can trigger a corrective fall to ₹312. But a strong break above ₹322 will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹330-335. Given the weakness in the broader markets, such a strong rally looks less probable. So the upside is likely to be limited to ₹322 at the moment. On the other hand, if SBI fails to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹313, a fall to ₹302 or even ₹297 is possible. As such, the impact of Friday's results will be short-lived and the overall negative sentiment in the market could weigh on the stock. In that case, SBI can fall to ₹ 290 and ₹287.
Uptrend in ITC under threat
ITC (₹297.7)





ITC moved up in the initial part of the week but failed to sustain higher. The uptrend that has been in place since late February seems to be under threat. A key support is at ₹295 which is likely to be tested in the near term. The stock has to hold above this support in order to keep the sentiment positive. A break below ₹295 can drag the stock initially lower to ₹288-287. A further break below ₹287 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹280-278. Such a fall to ₹280-278 will be a good buying opportunity from a long-term perspective. Investors with a long-term perspective can take long positions at ₹285 and accumulate at ₹282 and ₹278. On the other hand, if ITC manages to sustain above ₹295 in the coming days, a bounce to ₹302 — the crucial 21-day moving average resistance — is possible. The stock has to surpass this hurdle to bring back the bullish momentum. Else, a pull-back to ₹295 is possible again. In that case, ITC can remain range-bound between ₹295 and ₹302 for some time.
Infosys can witness a fresh fall
Infosys (₹716.05)





Infosys has crucial supports in the ₹706-703 region, which can be tested in the near term. It’s ability to sustain above this support zone will decide its next move. A bounce from the ₹706-703 support region will ease the downside pressure. It will increase the possibility of the stock moving higher to ₹730-735 in the short term. It will also keep the broader ₹700-775 sideways range intact. Infosys has been trading in this range since mid-January. But if the stock breaks below ₹703 in the coming days, it will come under renewed pressure. Such a break will take the stock initially lower to ₹690-685. A further break below ₹685 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹670-665 on profit-booking. Indicators on the chart favour a decline below ₹703 and a fall to ₹670-665 in the coming weeks. However, the region between ₹670 and ₹665 is a crucial long-term support, which may halt the fall. A decisive bounce from the ₹670-665 support zone could be a good buying opportunity from a long-term perspective.
Outlook turns bearish for RIL
RIL (₹1,250.5)





Contrary to an expectation of a rise, RIL tumbled 11 per cent last week. Morgan Stanley, a global brokerage firm, downgrading the stock seems to have made investors book profits, triggering this sharp sell-off. The uptrend that has been in place since October 2018 has reversed, and the outlook has turned bearish. Though there is some support near the current levels, the broader picture is negative. So, any bounce from the current levels may be short-lived and could be restricted to ₹1,300-1,320. A further fall to ₹1,200-1,180 is possible in the coming days. The region around ₹1,180 is a strong long-term trend support which can halt the fall. A bounce from there will be bullish from a long-term perspective. Investors can start buying RIL at ₹1,200 and also accumulate at ₹1,285 and ₹1,295. However, the possibility of a prolonged sideways move between ₹1,180 and ₹1,300 cannot be ruled out after this fall. As such, the rally to fresh highs thereafter might take time. So, investors buying around ₹1,200 will need to be patient and hold the stock for a long period of time.
Down-move to extend in Tata Steel
Tata Steel (₹487.3)





Tata Steel tumbled 11 per cent last week. Reports that the company’s joint venture with German steel maker Thyssenkrupp may not go through was a major trigger for the sell-off in the stock last week. The resistance at ₹560 has held well. It also keeps intact the downtrend that has been in place since January 2018. A strong resistance is in the ₹505-510 region which can cap the upside. A rally beyond ₹510 looks unlikely now. Also, an intermediate bounce to this resistance zone is likely to find fresh sellers coming into the market. A fall to ₹455-450 or even ₹440 is likely in the coming days. A further break below ₹440 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹425 or even ₹400. Traders with a short-term perspective can make use of rallies to go short at ₹498 and ₹505. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹522 for the target of ₹455. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹490 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹475.

The Ministry of Home Affairs has de-registered the Infosys Foundation from the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA).
The Foundation has said that it has not violated any FCRA norms, and was de-registered following its own request to the Ministry.
The Foundation was registered under the FCRA in January 2016. 
In May 2016, the government amended the FCRA in the Finance Bill with retrospective effect from 2010. 
As a result, the Foundation no longer fell within the purview of the FCRA, it said in a statement on Monday. 
The Foundation thereafter applied for its de-registration from the FCRA in June 2016, and had received acknowledgement from the FCRA wing in the same month.
The Foundation has submitted its annual returns for FY16, FY17 and FY18, even though it did not fall within the purview of the Act following its amendment. 
Additionally, the Foundation had also submitted necessary paperwork to the government in July 2018, in order to showcase that it has not received any foreign funding.
The Foundation has not received any notice to file returns pertaining to the FCRA after April 2018."

Infosys plans to grant annual performance-based stock incentives in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) with a market value of Rs 10 crore to its CEO and Managing Director, Salil Parekh. It has also set aside 5 crore shares to be distributed to a broad base of employees that will vest based on performance criteria.
This is part of the Infosys expanded stock ownership programme-2019, the company said in a release. It also carried out a change in the terms of appointment of Parekh by reducing the vesting period of annual performance equity grant to one year from three years. The grant of stock incentives is being given to Parekh to incentivise him to increase shareholder value and to drive execution excellence of the agreed business strategy.
Infosys’ COO, UB Pravin Rao will also get RSUs worth Rs 4 crore. The vesting period for Rao is 12 months from the date of each grant.
The IT major said its board has approved theProgram that links long term employee incentives with shareholder value creation. Subject to shareholder approval, this plan proposes to allocate 5 crore shares, equating 1.15 per cent of the company’s equity shares, to a broad base of employees.
The grants allocated to employees over a period of seven years will vest based on: relative total shareholder return (TSR) against an industry peer group; relative TSR against domestic and global indices; and operating lead performance metrics such as total revenue and digital revenue growth, and operating margins.
“Infosys has been a pioneer for many firsts in India, and this program is a key milestone as it sets another benchmark in the industry. Our employees are our biggest asset, and through this program we aim to recognise and reward individuals who are committed to driving value creation for all stakeholders through their continued and consistent performance. By making employees owners, they get an opportunity to be beneficiaries in the long term success of the company and realize the results of their work and dedication,” Parekh said."

He also received ₹ 7.64 crore in perquisites on account of exercise of 1,03,604 restricted stock units (RSUs) during fiscal 2019, the annual report said. 
Compared to this, Tata Consultancy Services CEO Rajesh Gopinathan drew a package of over ₹ 16 crore. In its annual report, the country’s IT services firm said Gopinathan’s compensation had grown over 28 per cent in FY2018-19. Gopinathan’s remuneration included ₹ 1.15 crore in salary, ₹ 1.26 crore in perquisites, ₹ 13 crore in commission and over ₹ 60 lakh in other allowances - all of which added up to a package of ₹ 16.02 crore.
Infosys chief operating officer UB Pravin Rao earned ₹ 9.05 crore in FY2018-19 against ₹ 8.22 crore in the previous financial year. His remuneration in FY2018-19 included ₹ 4.41 crore in fixed salary, ₹ 3.83 crore in bonus/incentives/variable pay and ₹ 0.81 crore in stock option.

During 2018-19, Infosys spent ₹1,165 crore to acquire majority stakes in three companies and is set to buy another company for ₹990 crore. According to the annual report of the company, Infosys acquired 81 per cent voting interest in Hitachi Procurement Service Company for ₹206 crore in April this year.
It is set to buy a 75 per cent stake in Stater NV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ABN Amro Bank NV for ₹990 crore. It had bought 100 per cent of Wong Doody Holding Company Inc. for ₹514 crore, Fluido Oy for ₹560 crore and 60 per cent stake in Infosys Compatz Pvt Ltd for ₹91 crore. As of now, Infosys has 25 direct subsidiaries and 34 step-down subsidiaries.
The company has invested $59 million in several start-ups out of the $500 million fund it had set up. It divested stakes in two start-ups and gained $8 million. Infosys said in its report that its capital expenditure nearly doubled to ₹3,040 crore in 2018-19. This includes ₹2,008 crore spent on infrastructure, ₹1,023 crore on buying computer equipment and ₹9 crore on vehicles, on a standalone basis. The company also has ₹30,793 crore in working capital on a standalone basis and ₹34,240 crore on a consolidated basis.
The company said its non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani did not voluntarily seek any remuneration during the year. In his letter to the shareholders, Salil Parekh, CEO and MD of Infosys, pointed out that after some years of change, it has been a year of stability, with a steady leadership team ready to engage with clients and ready to drive superior delivery capability.

Infosys on Friday completed the acquisition of 75 per cent shareholding in ABN AMRO Bank’s wholly-owned Stater NV.
In March, the country’s second largest IT services firm had said it will acquire 75 per cent stake in Stater for 127.5 million euros (about Rs 989 crore). ABN AMRO continues to hold the remaining 25 per cent.
“This partnership strengthens Infosys’ position as a leading technology and business process management provider across the mortgage services value chain, improving experience and operational efficiencies,” Infosys said in a statement on Friday.
It added that the deal further enhances its strategy to help clients navigate their next digital transformation journeys.
“The specialised knowledge and experience of Stater in the mortgage services market, combined with the global reach, artificial intelligence, digital transformation and automation capabilities of Infosys, can potentially create differentiated solutions for the market,” it said.
Founded in 1997, Stater is the largest mortgage service provider of the Benelux. It services 1.7 million mortgage and insurance loans for approximately 50 clients in The Netherlands and Belgium."
87,2019-06-09,Infosys,"‘Our focus is on early-career growth’

There is more stability at Infosys now than there had been a few years ago. At the same time, the IT industry is witnessing several changes, including a major push in digital technology. Hence, the focus has turned to reskilling, retraining existing employees, and tweaking compensation to align with new industry standards. In an interaction with BusinessLine, Infosys’ Executive Vice-President and Group Head-Human Resources, Krish Shankar shares the company’s strategy to peg down attrition levels, retain top talent, and provide opportunities for the employees to grow their skill sets. Excerpts:
How has Infosys’ HR policy evolved over the years, considering the fact that there is more focus on digital offerings now?
The digital business contributes about 30 per cent of our total revenues, and is growing at a rate of 25-30 per cent. There is a lot of technology which is at play as far as our policy is concerned. There are four elements to our strategy — driving digital, re-energising our core, reskilling, and building local talent. We want to make sure that people get a career that never stands still. That is also the promise we make to our employees. 
Obviously, employees need more reskilling now than before because of the technological changes...
We have created a roadmap for skilling our employees. We have created a set of 32 key skills at which they should be adept. Those who are successful get a ‘skill tag’, which shows their expertise at one or even more of the skills. We have also created a framework for agile careers for employees’ growth. Based on different skills and capabilities, they can choose what they want. For example, we have created a programme called ‘power programmer’. Those who are successful are perhaps the best we have. They also get rewarded; for example, their benefits are doubled. Then there are bridge programmes, which allow an employee to move into newer roles, like consulting, and in turn we reward them with better salaries. So, for every new skill they acquire, they are rewarded.
So, does that mean there has been a shift in the strategy?
We have moved to a new performance management system called iCount. Earlier, we had a relative ranking system, but now it is based on an individual’s absolute performance. It focusses more on giving feedback. There was a feeling that we have to get our performance system in tune with what the employees want and what is relevant for the business. Any system that is put in place should enable employees to improve their performance. This has allowed employees to get feedback from others. If, for example, I have done a project where three other people were involved, I can seek immediate feedback from them. 
Is there any programme to train future leaders at Infosys?
We are training a set of people who will take leadership positions in the company over a period of time. We identify 50-60 people and make them go through individual training. This includes a stint at Stanford University as well. At the lower level, we train about 25,000 fresh graduates every year at our Mysore Development Centre who go through a six-month training and then are deployed to other centres. 
Higher attrition levels must surely be an area of concern?
Attrition is quite cyclical. We have had low attrition earlier, but last year, it went up on rising demand. Around this time, employees leave for further education. I think overall, our focus is on how to create an environment for people to grow. We pride ourselves as a company where growth and career development are a priority. But attrition has been more at the lower levels, especially in the last 3-5 years period.
Some employees have claimed on review site Glassdoor that the salaries have not kept pace with the current industry standards...
We are competitive as far as the IT industry is concerned. But there are different parts to that. We have competitors who may pay more but have a disadvantage in terms of lack of career growth. We are trying to ensure our focus is on the early-career growth and we are strengthening that. 
What are the changes in the new stock option plan that you have rolled out recently?
The feedback we got was that we should increase the penetration of stock options and link the company’s performance to shareholder growth. So instead of merely having a stock option which will vest automatically, we have linked it with performance and total shareholder return. The idea is to ensure that as a company we keep the value of the shareholders in mind. As we grow, they will also get rewarded. 
 
The middle managers at several IT companies are seen as dispensable. So, is it possible to do away with their role altogether? 
The role of the managers keeps changing, but they are needed because they connect people. One major aspect of our HR policy is to that we try to make our managers perform better. We have a tool called ‘MaQ’ or manager quotient where each of the managers gets feedback. They are tested on parameters like how innovative they are, whether they are able to inspire their individual teams, coach their colleagues properly, and on the execution of projects."

85,2019-06-15,Infosys,"Weekly Trading Guide 
SBI (₹343.8)
SBI was stuck in a narrow range between ₹339 and ₹349 last week. The near-term outlook is mixed. SBI can trade sideways between the significant support at ₹335 and resistance at ₹350 for some time. Within this range, there is a strong likelihood of the stock falling to ₹335 — the lower end of the range in the early part of this week. A breakout on either side of ₹335 or ₹350 will decide the direction of the next move. A break below ₹335 can take SBI lower to ₹325 and ₹320. As being reiterated over the last couple of weeks, the region around ₹320 is a strong long-term resistance-turned-support, which can limit the downside. Fresh buyers are likely to emerge around this level. As such, a fall to ₹325-₹320 will be a good buying opportunity from a medium-term perspective. On the other hand, if SBI breaks above ₹350, it can move up to the next crucial resistance level of ₹362. SBI has to rise past ₹362 decisively to gain fresh bullish momentum. Targets above ₹362 are ₹390 and ₹400.





ITC (₹277.9)
 ITC has been managing to sustain above the crucial long-term support level of ₹275. However, the stock is not gaining strength for a strong rally. This indicates lack of fresh buying interest in the stock. ITC has to break above ₹282 to get a breather. Such a break can take it up towards ₹287 and ₹290. Only a strong rise past ₹290 will confirm the trend reversal, which will then pave way for the next targets of ₹300 and ₹310. But such a strong upmove looks unlikely at the moment. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average and is now on the verge of crossing below the 100-day moving average. This is a negative signal, indicating that the upside could be limited. It also keeps the possibilities open of the stock breaking below `275. As such, if ITC breaks below ₹275, the downside pressure will increase. In such a scenario, the current downtrend will remain intact and the stock can extend the fall to ₹265 and ₹260 thereafter. 





Infosys (₹740.4)
 Infosys moved up last week as expected, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹758.9 and reversed sharply lower, giving back almost all the gains. The resistance at ₹755 has held well. Key near-term supports are at ₹734 (21-week moving average) and ₹730 (21-day moving average), which are likely to limit the downside. A break and fall below ₹730 looks less probable now. As long as the stock trades above ₹730, the outlook will remain positive. An upward reversal from the ₹734-₹730 support zone can take the stock higher to ₹755 again. An eventual break above ₹755 will then take Infosys up to ₹770 and ₹775 — the upper end of the ₹695-₹775 sideways range. The stock has been stuck in this broad sideways range since mid-January this year. If it manages to rise past ₹775, it can gain fresh momentum and target ₹790 and ₹800. But a pull-back from ₹775 will keep the sideways range intact. In such a scenario, Infosys can fall-back initially to ₹760-₹750 and even lower thereafter. 





RIL (₹1,316.95)
RIL managed to sustain above ₹1,300 but is not gaining strength to move higher. The price action over the last few weeks increases the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,300. Inability to rise past ₹1,338 (55-day moving average) and a subsequent fall last week, strengthens the case for a fall below ₹1,300. RIL will come under renewed pressure on a break below ₹1,300 and can move lower to ₹1,280-1,275. This move could be sharp and swift. A further break below 1,275 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to 1,250 and even 1,220 over the medium term. On the other hand, if RIL manages to sustain above 1,300, a bounce to 1,338 is possible again. A break above 1,338 will then increase the possibility of the upmove extending to 1,350 and 1,360. The region between 1,360 and 1,365 is a crucial resistance. RIL has to rise past 1,365 to gain fresh momentum and target 1,400 and 1,430. But such a strong upmove looks unlikely at the moment. 





Tata Steel (₹501.4)
 Contrary to our expectation of a fall, Tata Steel surged last week. The stock was up 4 per cent. Support for the stock is in the ₹490-488 region. As long as the stock trades above this support zone, the near-term outlook will remain positive. A rise to ₹515-520 is likely. The region around 520 is a crucial long-term trend resistance. As such, Tata Steel has to rise past ₹520 decisively to turn the outlook bullish and also to signal a trend reversal. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹527-530. A further break above ₹530 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its upmove to ₹560 over the medium term. Inability to breach ₹520 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹500 and ₹490. A break below ₹490 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹460. In such a scenario, Tata Steel can trade in a sideways range between ₹460 and ₹520.

84,2019-06-22,Infosys,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (₹349.45)
SBI fell about 3 per cent in the initial part of the week. However, the stock managed to claw-back from the low of ₹333.75, recovering all the loss and closed 1.6 per cent higher for the week. An immediate resistance is at ₹352 for the stock which can be tested in the near future. A strong rise past this hurdle will take the stock higher to the next crucial resistance level of ₹362. 





As mentioned last week, SBI has to breach ₹362 decisively to gain fresh bullish momentum and target ₹390 and ₹400. But a pull-back from ₹362 can drag SBI lower to ₹350 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹335 and ₹362 for some more time. On the other hand, if SBI fails to surpass the immediate resistance level of ₹352, it can fall to ₹335 again. In that case, SBI can trade between ₹335 and ₹352 for some time. The stock will come under pressure if it declines below ₹335 levels. Such a break can take the stock lower to ₹325-320. The region around ₹320 is a strong long-term support and a further fall below it is unlikely.
 
ITC (₹274.2)
ITC continued to trade lower and has declined below ₹275 as expected. The stock was down 1.3 per cent last week. The outlook is bearish. Strong resistance is in the ₹280-282 region, which has been capping the upside over the last few weeks. Intermediate support is at ₹272.5. If this support holds, a range-bound move between ₹272.5 and ₹282 is possible for some time. 





However, the bias will continue to remain negative as the indicators on the charts are negative. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 100-day moving average as expected. This indicates that the downtrend is intact and the upside could be limited. An eventual break below ₹272.5 will bring renewed pressure on the stock. Such a break below will increase the likelihood of it tumbling towards ₹265 and ₹260. The levels of ₹262 and ₹257 are crucial long-term supports. The current downtrend is likely to find a bottom around these levels. A strong bounce from these supports will mark the beginning of a long-term uptrend in this stock.
 
Infosys (₹750.7)
Infosys has been stuck inbetween its support at ₹735 and resistance at ₹759 over the last couple of weeks. Within this range, the stock fell to ₹735 and bounced sharply from there to close 1.4 per cent higher last week. The 21-week moving average support level of ₹735 has held very well as expected and keeps the bullish view intact. 
 





The immediate resistance level of ₹759 is likely to be tested in the near term. The bias on the chart is positive. The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 55-day moving average. This is a bullish signal, which indicates that Infosys is likely to breach ₹759 and rise to ₹770 and ₹775 again. Inability to break above ₹775 can drag the stock lower to ₹755 and ₹750 again. Such a pull-back move will keep the broader ₹695-775 sideways range intact. The stock has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time since mid-January this year. On the other hand, if Infosys manages to surpass ₹775 decisively, it will gain fresh momentum and target ₹795 and ₹800 thereafter.
 
RIL (₹1,279.2)
As expected, RIL declined below the psychological level of ₹1,300. The stock was down about 3 per cent last week and closed decisively below the 21-week moving average level of ₹1,309. The level of ₹1,300 will now act as a strong support-turned-resistance and cap the upside. As long as the stock trades below ₹1,300, the outlook will remain negative. RIL has to rise past ₹1,300 decisively to negate the bearish view and rise to ₹1,320 and ₹1,350 levels again. 





But such a strong up-move looks unlikely now. As such, a fall to ₹1,240 can be seen in the near term. If the RIL stock manages to bounce from ₹1,240, a relief rally to ₹1,300 is possible. But a break below ₹1,240 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹1,220 and ₹1,200. The region between ₹1,220 and ₹1,200 is a strong long-term support for the stock. A further fall below ₹1,200 looks unlikely as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at those levels. A strong bounce from ₹1,200 may indicate the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend for the stock.
 
Tata Steel (₹497.75)
Tata Steel tumbled over 7 per cent intraweek, but managed to bounce-back, recovering almost all the loss. The near-term outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹492 and resistance at ₹506. A breakout on either side of ₹492 or ₹506 will decide the direction of the next move. 





A break above ₹506 will ease the downside pressure. Such a break will take the stock higher to ₹515 and ₹520. The region around ₹520 is a crucial long-term resistance, which has to be breached decisively to turn the outlook bullish. A break above ₹520 can take Tata Steel up to ₹530. But if the stock breaks below ₹492, it can fall initially to ₹475. A further break below ₹475 will then increase the likelihood of the stock revisiting ₹465-460 levels. Tata Steel can trade in a wide range of ₹460-520 in the coming weeks. A breakout on either side of ₹460 or ₹520 will set the direction of the next move.

Salil Parekh, CEO and MD of the firm, has come in and articulated a great strategy,” he said. “You can see that in numbers - the company is growing very well, people are very motivated,” he said in response to a question whether stability was back at the company.
 Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the 38th Annual General Meeting of Infosys, he said, “So I’m very optimistic, things are going well.” Nilekani was appointed as the Chairman to steer the tech giant in August 2017, after months of acrimony between founders and the then management led by R Seshasayee (chairman) and Vishal Sikka (CEO and MD).
 The IT major held its 38th AGM on Saturday that was attended by hundreds of shareholders from the city and different parts of the country. Responding to a question related to Panaya and Skava businesses by shareholders, Parekh during the AGM said as stated in the financial report and results, Panaya and Skava were not being held as assets for sale.
 A whistle-blower report in 2017 had alleged wrongdoings by Infosys and some officials in the $ 200- million acquisition of Israeli automation technology firm Panaya by the Bengaluru-based IT services firm. An internal audit committee set up by Infosys found no evidence supporting the whistle-blowers allegations.
Earlier in his address to the AGM, Nilekani said Infosys was embracing the Live Enterprise vision and continuously changing to prepare for the new world. “In fact, in the past year, we have done much to progress on this path. We’ve been working relentlessly to rebuild our 2,00,000-plus people organisation to operate with the speed and flexibility of a start-up, he said."

Infosys’ top executives put shareholders’ concerns about the future of its subsidiaries, Panaya and Skava, to rest saying that they have been taken off the sale list and will now be nurtured and put on a growth path.
The Israeli enterprise software management firm, Panaya, was bought for $200 million in 2015, while the San Francisco-based Skava, which provides a cloud-based platform for online services for retailers, was bought for $120 million.
But soon after their acquisitions, a whistleblower raised concerns about the lack of transparency in the deal. The controversy was one of the main reasons for the exit of CEO Vishal Sikka in 2017.
Responding to shareholders’ queries at the company's 38th Annual General Meeting here on Saturday, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said, “Panaya and Skava have not been put on sale. We have stated this in our annual report and financial results. We are now looking at how to refocus and repurpose activities within these businesses with a view to growing these acquisitions.”
The decision to take both these subsidiaries off the sale list was first reported by BusinessLine in July 2018."

 IT major Infosys said it has hired over 9,000 people in the US between April 2017 and March 2019, almost meeting its target of recruiting 10,000 American workers.
The move has helped the company strengthen its business model, it added.
 “Since April of 2017, we have hired about 9,100 people as of March 2019. This has actually helped us in strengthening our business model and becoming less dependent on visa for for talent or ability,” Infosys COO UB Pravin Rao said at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM).

In May 2017, Infosys had announced that it will set up four technology and innovation hubs and hire about 10,000 locals in the US over a two-year period.
The Bengaluru-based company, like many of its peers, has been ramping local hiring in key markets like the US, the UK and Australia to tackle increasing scrutiny around work visas by various governments.
Infosys is also focussing on co-creating and co-innovating alongside clients, academia and government to accelerate innovation as well as upskill talent in emerging technologies and solutions.
North America is the largest market for Infosys, accounting for 61.2 per cent of its topline, followed by Europe (24 per cent), rest of the world (12.5 per cent) and India (2.3 per cent) at the end of the March 2019 quarter.
Infosys had reported 19.1 per cent increase in revenue from operations at Rs 21,539 crore in the quarter. Its total headcount was over 2.28 lakh at the end of March.
Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani described FY2018-19 as a year of “resolute stability” and said the company has deepened its focus on strengthening its digital capabilities, especially in areas like analytics, cloud, Internet of Things, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and machine learning."

Infosys MD & CEO Salil Parekh with CFO Nilanjan Roy at a press meet in Bengaluru on Friday to announce the company’s Q1 results

Infosys on Friday reported a strong revenue growth in the first quarter as it bagged more orders, and raised its guidance for FY20.
The IT services firm raised its revenue growth guidance for FY20 to 8.5-10 per cent in constant currency. Last quarter, it had said it expected a revenue growth of 7.5-9.5 per cent in FY20.
Reacting to the result and revenue guidance, the ADRs of Infosys jumped 7.8 per cent at $11.56 in early trade on Nasdaq. They were quoting at $11.39 at 8.30 pm IST.
MD and CEO Salil Parekh said Infosys had a good start to FY20, aided by a strong deal pipeline and digital revenue growth of 41.9 per cent.
For the quarter ended June 30, it reported a total contract value of $2.7 billion, one of its highest. This follows the $1.6 billion in total contract value in Q4 FY19. “This, coupled with strong growth in digital revenues, is a positive,” said Sanjeev Hota, AVP - Research at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.
Infosys reported Q1 revenues of ₹21,803 crore, a 14 per cent growth over the previous year period. On a sequential basis, its revenue grew 1.2 per cent from ₹21,539 crore.
Net profit rose 5.1 per cent year-on-year to ₹3,802 crore. However, on a sequential basis, it fell 6.8 per cent from ₹4,078 crore in the March quarter.
The quarter also saw Infosys’ margins go down to 20.5 per cent from 23.7 per cent in the June 2018 quarter.
The company reported a 23.4 per cent attrition rate, up from 20.4 per cent in Q4 FY19. “Elevated attrition numbers continue to remain a sour point for the company,” said Hota.
Infosys has made some changes to its capital allocation policy. From the current policy of paying up to 70 per cent of free cash flow back to shareholders, it has increased the payout to 85 per cent. However, this additional 85 per cent will be paid cumulatively over a five-year period through a combination of semi-annual dividends and/or share buyback and/or special dividends.
The company said it is on track to complete its previously announced share buyback of ₹8,260 crore. Till date it has bought back shares worth ₹5,934 crore."

 Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy said on Saturday that looking at “what is happening in different parts of the country today”, the youth need to state bluntly that this was not the country for which our forefathers got freedom.
 Talking about his spat with Vishal Sikka, Infosys’ first non-promoter chief executive who quit in 2017, he said he had to speak up when he saw core values of the IT giant being thrown into the “dustbin“.
Speaking at a panel discussion at St Xavier’s College here, Murthy referred to Sikka’s confrontation with him and other promoters, without naming him, when asked about the concerns he had expressed about the way Infosys was being led after his retirement.
“There was not a single word in public that I have spoken about the business strategy or the actions of the executive,” Murthy said.

“However, when the question of value systems we had built for over 33 years making huge sacrifices (came up), when you see those value systems being thrown to dustbin, then automatically the leaders in our society and country have to stand up and express their anguish and disappointment,” he said.
“Otherwise we would have allowed those mistakes to continue. (In) 2014 CEO (Sikka) was given 55 per cent hike on (salary of) 7 million USD....COO (then Chief Operating Officer Pravin Rao) was given 30 per cent hike. No middle-level fellow was given any salary increase,” he said.
“Security guards (were) told to work an extra day without increase in salary or overtime. I think that is a serious violation of values,” he added.
“Therefore, if somebody like me who built the company from scratch with the help of six junior colleagues, if I don’t stand up for the erosion of the value systems, then I would have failed in our duty singularly,” Murthy added.
 If the core values of Infosys such as “leadership by example, fairness, transparency, accountability” were “thrown to the dust, then you have to stand up and voice your anguish and disappointment”, he stated.
 Sikka quit in 2017 after almost a year of public dispute with Murthy and other promoter shareholders.
 Murthy further made the point that Indians generally tend not to “displease” anybody even when it is needed.
“If you look at what is happening in different parts of the country today, it is time that we, especially the youth, stood up and say this is not the kind of the country our forefathers had got the freedom for.
“But how many of us are doing it? Nobody is doing it, sadly. That’s the reason why this country is in this state that it is. Nobody wants to displease anybody by saying what is wrong,” he added."

It lifted its revenue forecast for year ending March 2020 to between 8.5 per cent and 10 per cent on constant currency basis from 7.5 per cent to 9.5 per cent.
Infosys shares were up 13.7 per cent year-to-date."
75,2019-07-15,Infosys,"Infosys’ sequential growth sputters despite digital boost and large deals 
Infosys posted a lower net profit in the June quarter of FY20, at ₹3,798 crore (down 6.8 per cent sequentially), despite robust growth in digital revenues. Revenues rose marginally by 1.23 per cent to ₹21,803 crore as the company’s core offerings saw revenue remain flat.
In dollar terms, digital revenue ($ 1.12 billion) grew by 8.6 per cent sequentially while core revenues fell 0.64 per cent to $2.01 billion. Most of the growth in revenues came from communication and energy business segments in constant currency terms, with the former growing 4.6 per cent and the latter 4.74 per cent.
Financial services saw muted revenue growth in constant currency terms at 1.67 per cent. It makes up nearly one-third of Infosys’ revenues in dollar terms. The management is confident on growth from financial services, despite softness in some pockets. There were two customers added in the $100-million category and six in the $10-million bucket, during the quarter. It lost one customer in the $50-million bucket during the quarter.
After sewing up $2.7 billion of deal in the quarter, one of the highest in a quarter, Infosys upgraded its yearly guidance on revenues. The company moved its full year guidance on consolidated revenue in constant currency terms upwards to 8.5-10 per cent from 7.5-9.5 per cent. It maintained its margin guidance at 21 – 23 per cent.
Operating margins fell sequentially to 20.5 per cent from 21.5 per cent in the March quarter of FY19 because of higher employee costs and travel costs. The June quarter coincides with pay rises for staff. Consolidated staff costs rose by 1.9 per cent to ₹12,302 crore. Even so, this is the fourth straight quarter where the company’s margins have shrunk.
Last financial year, the company’s focus was on investment for the future, hence the margin fall was understandable. The management says the margin fall in the June quarter in FY20 is due to seasonal factors like pay hikes.
Attrition was marginally higher at 23.4 per cent, which can be attributed to seasonal issues when employees depart for higher studies. The attrition, however, is higher among lower levels compared to high performers. The management said they are trying to evolve a strategy to contain the high attrition levels.
Infosys revised its capital allocation policy upwards, which will now entail distributing 85 per cent of its free cash flows to investors cumulatively over a five-year period. The management is confident of meeting its future investment needs even after the change in its capital allocation policy, with nearly $3.5 billion in cash reserves. They said the company will leverage this cash balance, if necessary, for acquisitions in the future."
73,2019-07-27,Infosys,"Weekly Trading Guide 
SBI (₹342.5)
SBI tumbled 3.8 per cent last week, breaking below the key support level of ₹350. The next support near ₹335 is holding well as of now. As long as SBI sustains above this support, a corrective rally to ₹350 is possible in the near term. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹350 are needed to ease the downside pressure and bring back the bullish sentiment. But a rally beyond ₹350 looks less probable now as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels. A pull-back from ₹350 can drag the stock lower to ₹335 again. An eventual break below the key base level of ₹335 will then increase the likelihood of the downtrend resuming and declining to ₹328. The level of ₹328 is a strong support where both the 21-week moving average as well as a trend-line support are poised. As such the current down-move can halt around ₹328 and a bounce to ₹335-340 is possible from there. But if SBI declines below ₹328, the down-move can extend to ₹320 in the ensuing weeks.





ITC (₹270.3)
ITC fell over a per cent in the initial part of the week, but managed to bounce thereafter. The stock made a low of ₹264.4 and reversed higher recovering all the loss. The 200-week moving average support is holding well as of now. However, a key resistance is at ₹273 (21-day moving average) which has to be breached to get a breather. A strong break above ₹273 can trigger a corrective rally to ₹278 and ₹282. The region between ₹282 and ₹285 is a strong resistance which is likely to cap the upside. A rise past ₹285 looks unlikely at the moment. On the other hand, if ITC fails to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹273 in the coming days, it can dip to test ₹263 again. A sideways consolidation between ₹263 and ₹273 is possible for some time. The bias will remain bearish. An eventual break below ₹263 can take the stock initially lower to ₹257. A further break below ₹257 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹245 – a strong long-term support.
 



Infosys (₹787.3)
Infosys rose last week to test ₹800 as expected, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹804.25 and oscillated between ₹782 and ₹805 all through the week. The near-term outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹780 and resistance at ₹800. The stock can trade sideways between ₹780 and ₹800 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹780 or ₹800 will then determine the direction of the next move. A break below ₹780 can trigger profit-booking and drag the stock lower to ₹765. A cluster of supports is poised in the band between ₹765 and ₹750. So the downside could be limited to ₹750 if the stock declines below ₹780. On the other hand, if Infosys manages to sustain above ₹780, the bias will remain positive. It will keep the possibility high of the stock breaking above ₹800. Such a break above ₹800 will give a fresh boost to the stock. It will also indicate the resumption of the uptrend and take the stock up to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks.





RIL (₹1,214.1)
RIL tumbled 2.8 per cent, breaking below the crucial support level of ₹1,250. The price action over the last month indicates that the stock has been lacking strong buyers to take it above ₹1,300. This coupled with the sharp fall below ₹1,250 gives an initial sign of the long-term uptrend getting reversed. A further fall below the psychological level of ₹1,200 will confirm the same. Such a fall will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹1,130-1,120 in the coming weeks. The move below ₹1,200 could be sharp and swift as it could trigger strong profit-booking. But, if RIL manages to sustain above ₹1,200, a bounce to ₹1,250 is possible. In such a scenario, a sideways move in the ₹1,200-1,250 band can be seen for some time. RIL has to rise past ₹1,250 decisively to ease the downside pressure. A rise to ₹1,300 is possible on a break above ₹1,250. But such a strong up-move looks unlikely at the moment as fresh sellers are likely to emerge around ₹1,250 levels and cap the upside. 





Tata Steel (₹445.2)
Tata Steel extended its fall and kept the downtrend intact. The stock was down 2.8 per cent last week. An immediate resistance is in the ₹448-450 region and the next significant one is at ₹470, which can cap the upside. A rise past ₹470 looks unlikely. Tata Steel is likely to tumble towards ₹400 in the coming weeks. The region around ₹400 is a key support. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement support is also poised around ₹400. As such, the current fall can halt at ₹400. A corrective rally to ₹450 is possible if Tata Steel manages to bounce from ₹400. But the upside of this corrective rally is likely to be capped at ₹450. But if the stock fails to bounce from ₹400 and falls further, the downside pressure will increase. The break below ₹400 will see the stock tumbling to ₹350 or lower over the medium term.

70,2019-08-10,Infosys,"Weekly Trading Guide 
SBI (₹291.3)
SBI continued the fall for the fifth consecutive week. The stock tumbled 5.5 per cent last week. With this fall, the stock has plummeted 21.4 per cent over the last five weeks. On the charts, there is room for the fall to extend further in the coming days. The levels of ₹304 and ₹307 are the key near-term resistances which can cap the upside. There is possibility of a sideways consolidation between ₹285 and ₹307 (200-day moving average) in the near term. But a strong rise past ₹307 looks less likely now as the broader bias continues to remain negative. As such, SBI is likely to decline eventually below ₹285 and extend the current downtrend to ₹275-273 or even ₹269. The broad region between ₹275 and ₹269 is a strong support zone, which can halt the current fall. A corrective rally to ₹290-300 is possible from this support zone on short-covering. But if SBI declines below ₹269, it will come under more pressure. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹245-240 or even ₹230.





ITC (₹254.2)
ITC fell about 4 per cent last week breaking below the support level of ₹263 (200-week moving average) as expected. The downtrend remains intact. However, ITC is coming closer to an intermediate support level of ₹250. If it manages to bounce from this support, a corrective up-move to ₹260 or ₹265 is possible. ITC may, thus, remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. However, a strong rally beyond ₹265 looks unlikely. An eventual break below ₹250 will see the stock resuming the downtrend to ₹240 — possibly the last leg of move in the current downtrend. The level of ₹240 is a strong long-term trend support, which can halt the current downtrend. A strong bounce from ₹240 can take the stock up to ₹260-265. There is possibility of the stock forming a base by consolidating between ₹240 and ₹265. A decisive break above ₹265 can start a fresh rally, targeting ₹290-300 over the medium term. But if ITC declines below ₹240, the fall can extend to ₹230-228 band.





Infosys (₹790.1)
Infosys has remained stuck between ₹755 and ₹805 over the last four weeks. Within this range, the stock rose about 2 per cent last week. The near-term outlook continues to remain unclear. The up-move in the past week looks weak. This reduces the possibility l of the stock breaking above ₹805 — the upper end of the range at the moment. The stock can reverse lower again towards ₹765 and ₹755 and maintain the sideways move t for some more time. A breakout on either side of ₹755 or ₹805 will determine the direction of the next move. If Infosys manages to break above ₹805, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break will indicate the resumption of the broader uptrend. It will then take the stock up to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if Infosys breaks the range below ₹755, it can come under pressure. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹740. A further break below ₹740 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending towards ₹715 and ₹700 on profit-booking.





RIL (₹1,162.0)
RIL tumbled over 7 per cent intra-week to a low of ₹1,095.65. However, the stock has managed to claw-back sharply from the low. But this bounce-back is just a short-covering rally which may not last long. A further rise to test the immediate resistance level of ₹1,190 is possible in the near term. A break above ₹1,190 will extend the corrective rally to ₹1,220. However, a further rise past ₹1,220 is less likely as fresh sellers can emerge at higher levels. Also, the indicators on the charts are bearish. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average. This is a bearish signal, indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, RIL is likely to reverse lower either from ₹1,190 or ₹1,220. It will then take the stock lower to ₹1,100-1,090 levels again. Inability to break below ₹1,090 can keep the stock sideways between ₹1,090 and ₹1,220 for some time. But the bias will continue to remain negative and RIL is likely to decline below ₹1,090 eventually. Such a break will then drag the stock lower to ₹1,050 and ₹1,030





Tata Steel (₹362.3)
Tata Steel is on a free fall and has declined to ₹360 as expected. The stock tumbled 11.4 per cent last week. Tata Steel has plummeted over 28 per cent in the last six weeks. An immediate support is at ₹358. If Tata Steel manages to bounce from this support, a corrective rally to ₹385 or ₹400 is possible on short-covering. A rise past ₹400 is unlikely now as fresh sellers can emerge at higher levels and keep the broader downtrend intact. As such, an eventual break below ₹358 will see the current fall extending to ₹330 and ₹325. As cautioned last week, from a long-term perspective, the current downtrend which had begun in 2018 is looking strong. This downtrend may have the potential to drag Tata Steel to ₹250-230. An intermediate halt and a corrective bounce is possible from the ₹310-300 support zone before the targets of ₹250-230 are achieved.

SBI can face resistance ahead
After taking a breather in the week earlier, SBI resumed its fall and tumbled 6.8 per cent last week. Though there is a possibility to see a near-term corrective bounce, the broader picture remains weak. A strong resistance at ₹280 can cap the rally. A consolidation between ₹260 and ₹280 for a week cannot be ruled out. The indicators on the charts remain bearish, keeping the doors open for further fall. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average — a bearish cross-over indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, SBI is likely to keep the downtrend intact and break below ₹260 in the coming days. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹250-245. A further break below ₹245 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹230. The broad region between ₹240 and ₹230 is a strong support zone which can halt the current downtrend. A corrective rally, thereafter, to ₹270-280 cannot be ruled out. But a strong break below ₹230 will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling further to ₹190-180 over the medium term.





ITC breaks crucial long-term support
ITC is under pressure. The stock plummeted 6.8 per cent last week. This sharp fall has dragged the stock well below the crucial long-term support level of ₹240. We will have to wait and see if ITC sustains below ₹240 and confirms the break. It has to reverse sharply higher and close decisively above ₹243 to get a breather. In such scenario, the chances of seeing a further fall will get reduced, and a corrective rally to ₹255 and ₹260 is possible. But an inability to bounce above ₹243 can take ITC lower to the next key support level of ₹228.5. If it manages to hold above this support, it can consolidate between ₹228 and ₹243 for some time. But as long as ITC trades below ₹243, it will remain under pressure. An eventual break below ₹228.5 will confirm the break of the long-term uptrend and intensify the fall further. Such a break will see the stock tumbling further towards the next major support levels of ₹211 and ₹207. It will also keep the possibilities high of the stock extending the fall even up to ₹200 and ₹190.





Infosys to remain range-bound
Infosys broke the ₹755-805 range on the upside last week, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹809.95 and came off slightly from there to close just below the upper end of the ₹755-805 range. The stock was up 3.5 per cent last week. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹805 are needed to confirm the range breakout. A key support is at ₹789. As long as Infosys remains above this support, there is a strong likelihood of the stock breaking the range above ₹805. Such a break will boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks. But if the stock remains below ₹805, a narrow range-bound move between ₹789 and ₹805 is possible in the near term. A break below ₹789 will reduce the chances of the stock breaching ₹805. Such a break will see an initial dip to ₹785. A further break below ₹785 will then strengthen the downmove and drag the stock lower to ₹768 and ₹763. In that case, the ₹755-805 range will continue to remain intact.





 
Near-term outlook is unclear for RIL
RIL fell sharply by 4 per cent intra-week to make a low of ₹1,226.8. However, it managed to claw back on Friday, recovering all the loss. RIL has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹1,225 and ₹1,304 over the past couple of weeks. This leaves the near-term outlook mixed. As mentioned last week, RIL can consolidate sideways between ₹1,215 and ₹1,305. A breakout on either side of ₹1,215 or ₹1,305 will determine the direction of the next move. Though the strong bounce on Friday keeps the bias positive, weakness in the broader markets may play spoil sport. As such, the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,215 in the coming days cannot be ruled out. Such a break will bring renewed pressure on the stock and increase the chances of it revisiting ₹1,150 and ₹1,100 levels in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if RIL breaks above ₹1,305 decisively, it will gain fresh momentum. In such a scenario, the stock can surge to ₹1,400. An eventual break above ₹1,400 will then pave way for a further rally to ₹1,480 over the medium term.





The downtrend remains intact in Tata Steel. The stock tumbled 5 per cent last week. It has plummeted over 30 per cent over the last eight weeks. The support in the ₹330-320 zone mentioned last week is holding well as of now. But the indicators on the charts are bearish. The 21-week moving average is on the verge of crossing below the 200-week moving average. This is a negative signal indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, it can continue to remain under pressure and any intermediate bounce could be short-lived. An immediate resistance is in the ₹353-355 region which can cap the upside in the near term and keep the stock under pressure. An eventual break below ₹320 will see the fall extending to ₹300 and even lower going forward. Also, as being reiterated in this column over the past few weeks, the current downtrend — which has been in place since 2018 — looks strong. It has the potential to drag Tata Steel lower to ₹250-230 in the coming months.

65,2019-09-07,Infosys,"Infy rallies behind Padukone Academy 
 
Watching PV Sindhu bring home the gold in badminton recently and become a world champion is enough to tell us that the Infosys Foundation is backing the right cause.
It announced this week that it will support the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy in Bengaluru to unearth promising new talent from across the country and provide world class coaching to motivated aspirants.
Infosys has allocated a grant of ₹16 crore for a five-year programme that will target 65 junior sportspersons and nurture them into future contenders at the Asian Games, the Commonwealth Games and the Olympics.
Several grassroot workers hope that talent under this scheme is garnered from small towns and remote areas as people in many of these places do not get sufficient opportunities. And that’s what Vimal Kumar, Co-Founder and Chief Coach of PPBA, says is on the cards. “Today, at PPBA, we have athletes from diverse backgrounds and age groups who are steadfastly focused on excelling in this game, and it gives me immense joy when I see our past and present athletes excel in the national and international arena. This support from Infosys Foundation will be significant in taking our training programme to the next level,” he says."
64,2019-09-09,Infosys,"More banks will soon enter the platform business: Rajashekara Maiya
 
Banks in more than 100 countries rely on Infosys’ flagship product Finacle, an industry-leading digital banking solution suite, to service more than a billion consumers and 1.3 billion accounts. BusinessLine spoke to Rajashekara V Maiya, Vice-President and Global Head, Business Consulting, Infosys Finacle, to get a sense of the technological shifts in the banking industry and how Finacle is riding the change. Excerpts:
How has the Finacle journey been so far?
Today, we have 200 global clients across 100 countries in six continents that serve more than a billion customers. Around 16.5 per cent of the global banks transact on Finacle platforms, which is a big number. Apart from this, it is the most-awarded and recognised solution from industry-leading analysts. The solution set consists of digital business engines such as back-end processing services, including payments and ledgers. On top of this, we have the Finacle digital engagement hub that provides APIs to banks to adhere to open-banking initiatives across the globe.
Could you give me a sense of the technological shifts in the banking industry? How is Finacle driving digital transformation in financial institutions around the world?
Competition does not come from banks, but non-banking entrants from the telecommunications, retail, and insurance background. Growth avenues are opening up for banks, which are not the traditional routes – there are quite a few new and innovative products coming into the picture.
One such product is the digital payments, which is changing the landscape of banking globally.
What are the global changes in digital payments?
Many more countries are announcing regulations to standardise and re-regulate the whole system, which is applicable in the India context. This will lead to a more advanced payments system globally. A fixated value for, high value and low-volume transactions are paving the way for low value, high-volume transactions; more than 2.2 billion transactions are driven through UPI. The PSD2 in the EU, UK, Australia, Hong Kong, and Africa all are coming up with new directives.
We launched the digital payments solutions from Finacle in 2013. Singapore and Hong Kong have issued directives for virtual banks.
Many payments services have been launched in India, such as Google Pay, Amazon Pay, which means that while purchasing goods on Amazon users can make payments directly using the app. In the India context, a majority of the transactions are being carried out by PhonePe, GooglePay, and PayTM, which is an opportunity for everyone.
The third aspect is that a lot of data is generated via these transactions through payments or digital banks. There is potential to unlock that data using analytics
How is the banking industry moving globally?
In the next 2 to 3 years, banking will move into a platform-based business. Globally, some of the top companies are platform-based ones. Sixty per cent of the global unicorn companies, unlisted companies valued at more than a billion dollars, are platform companies. In Asia, 31 out of 36 unicorn companies are platform companies. In the Indian context, of the 9 unicorn companies, 8 are platform companies.
So, there is a huge need for the industry to get into the platform business; thereby, you create a market place where you work in an ecosystem, you provide capability for people to come on to your platform and leverage it and to do business. So, we see that going forward, entities are moving into the platform business.
For example, PayTM in India has a platform that provide a comprehensive space. Similarly, the app that was launched by DBS Bank in India has turned somewhat into a marketplace, which offers retailing, deals and offers for customers.
Similarly, we expect more and more banks to enter the platform business. ICICI Bank launched ‘ICICI Corporate Connect’, where they onboarded almost 250 corporates onto the blockchain network, so supply chain management operations became easier.
We see more and more innovative brands leveraging the platform business to improve their relevance and valuations, and the business model is going to change drastically and that is what we are seeing."

62,2019-09-13,Infosys,"India ranks highest in recruiting right talent for digital initiatives: Infy study
 Digitisation of businesses is driving demand for new technical skills that industries are struggling to find. There is a need to fill AI, blockchain, big data analytics roles but a new study says corporates are unable to find the right talent.
What was once called a ‘talent war’ has turned a ‘talent famine’, according to the study by Infosys Knowledge Institute (IKI), the research arm of IT major Infosys.
IKI conducted a global study titled Talent Radar in July this year, among over 1,000 senior management executives, working for companies with revenue greater than $1 billion.
The study notes that digitising business is ‘less about disruption and more about meeting focussed objectives’, and this could include better understanding of customers and markets according to 46 per cent of respondents, while others felt it was customer experience (45 per cent), increasing productivity (40 per cent) and employee experience (35 per cent).
Respondents in India and China scored the highest on the Talent Readiness Index, thereby indicating they are better able to staff required skills at scale, and also lack legacy systems and structures that burden the West. 
Other findings showed that India ranked highest in the ability to find and staff required skills for digital initiatives (at 69 per cent).
Moreover, respondents from India prioritised performance management initiatives 50 per cent above the global average, suggesting that a metrics focus translates to talent success. The study showed organisations need to evolve holistically in order to hire and retain talent. Regardless of the industry, the skills in the greatest demand but hardest to find are adaptability, communication and analytics.
The skills with lesser demand but also in short supply, are analytics, AI, automation and empathy. 
The report notes companies that embrace multiple approaches for developing and managing talent are the most successful in getting the skills that they need. According to the study, at a time when talent is scarce and getting scarcer, being able to do multiple things simultaneously might be the critical differentiator for companies to meet their talent demands."

SBI (₹291.7)
After trading within a range, SBI began to head north and gained throughout the week, breaking above the critical resistance at ₹280. In fact, it was the biggest weekly gain for the stock in the past 16 weeks, moving up by 6.5 per cent. The weekly chart of SBI shows a morning star candlestick pattern, indicating a potential reversal in the medium-term trend. The stock has also moved past its 21-day moving average, which also indicates strongbuying interest in the past week. The daily relative strength index has crossed the mid-point level of 50 after nearly two months, and the moving average convergence divergence indicator also points upwards, implying considerable strength in the bullish trend. Assuming that the prevailing bullish sentiment will help the stock go up further, breaking a resistance at ₹292 will help the stock move towards the ₹300 levels and beyond in the medium term. But if the stock witnesses profit-booking or reacts to the resistance and slides lower, it might decline to ₹288 levels, below which the support is at ₹280.
 





 
ITC (₹239.9)
ITC continues to be held within the ₹240-247 limits. After testing the upper limit of the range at ₹247 — where the 21-day moving average level too coincides — failed to break above and corrected from that level towards the lower limit of the range at ₹240. Most of the decline was during the last two trading sessions, when the stock lost 1.6 per cent. The daily relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator remains flat, implying a lack of trend. Hence, unless the stock breaks either of the limits of the consolidation range, it is better to stay away from initiating new positions. If the weakness in the latter part of the previous week pulls down the price of the scrip further and it goes below ₹240, the immediate support lies at ₹236. If the stock declines below ₹236, the sell-off could intensify and the price might tumble to ₹224 levels. Alternatively, a bounce from the current level will result in the stock inching up towards ₹247 in the upcoming week, beyond which it will face a resistance in the band between ₹250 and ₹252 levels.
 





 
Infosys (₹829.3)
The stock of Infosys could not continue its uptrend. The stock corrected in the past week when the price dropped to a low of ₹810.85, after opening the week a bit lower at ₹836.80 against ₹840.15 — its previous week close. The stock was supported by 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bullish swing at ₹814. And, on Friday, the stock recovered some of its losses as it opened the session at ₹818.65 and closed higher at ₹829.3 levels. The scrip still trades above 21-day moving average, thereby not posing any immediate threat to the prevailing bullish trend. The relative strength index continue to feature in bullish zone. Hence, if the stock regains the momentum and goes up, it will most likely appreciate towards a lifetime high at ₹847 and even to ₹875 levels in medium term. On the other hand, if the stock is weighed down by factors such as profit-booking or a stronger rupee, it is most likely to drift towards the support band between ₹800 and ₹804 — the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of previous swing in the coming week.
 





 
RIL (₹1225.6)
Reliance Industries continues to trade within a tight range — between ₹1,200 and ₹1,240. The upside for the stock is blocked by the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, essentially lying in the same price area, near the ₹1,240 levels. A prolonged consolidation might reduce the significance of both the moving averages, unless the stock moves out of the band. . The relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator plotted on the daily chart of the stock stay direction-less, failing to provide any clue about the upcoming trend. So, until the stock breaks out of the tight price range within which it is oscillating, it might prove costly to make any directional bets. In case the stock moves up buoyed by the positive sentiment in the equity benchmarks and breaches ₹1,240, it is very likely that the price will appreciate to ₹1,300 levels, thereby moving past both the moving average, which may also push RSI above 50. However, if the stock breaks the lower boundary of the range, immediate support is at ₹1,180 and ₹1,140 thereafter.
 





Tata Steel (₹367.35)
Tata Steel edged up last week and closed with a weekly gain of 3.4 per cent. Thus, the share price of the steel major has posted gains for the second consecutive week. The stock has moved beyond the 21-day moving average, as it witnessed some buying interest in the past two weeks. On Friday, the scrip, after opening at ₹367.05, closed the day at ₹367.35 — the 38 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend. Though the stock made a high of ₹379.5 on Thursday, it could not hold on, declining and closing the session at ₹365.05, witnessing some selling pressure. Daily candle on Thursday is a shooting star pattern, meaning there are chances for reversal in the trend. The relative strength index too is nearing the mid-point of 50, and a decisive break above that level may help the stock appreciate further towards ₹395 levels. On the other hand, if the stock price depreciates from the current levels, it will most probably retest ₹350 — the 21-day moving average — below which it could tumble to ₹330 levels."

SBI (₹301.7)
SBI began the week marginally lower at ₹288.2 compared with the previous week close of ₹291.7. The stock declined further to ₹273 levels during the earlier part of the week. However, on Friday, it surged with huge volumes and closed the day with 10 per cent gain. It also moved past resistances at ₹292 and ₹300, closing the week at ₹301.7, posting a considerable weekly gain of 3.4 per cent. Before moderating to ₹301.7, the stock registered a high of ₹307.65, where the 50-day moving average lies. There’s a resistance in the band between ₹305.1 — the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level — and ₹307.65. With the daily relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator pointing upwards and the stock breaking above ₹300, the current rally may continue to push the stock price up to ₹318 and then to ₹320 levels. Alternatively, if the stock slides down after testing the resistance band between ₹307.65 and ₹305.1, it might decline to ₹292 levels.





ITC (₹238.05)
ITC, the stock price of which has been trading in a range between ₹240 and ₹247, declined below the lower limit on Tuesday. The stock retested a support at ₹234.65, from where the price attempted to recover twice in the past one month. However, on both occasions, the recovery was blocked by resistance at ₹247. As a result, the stock seems to have formed a broader range between ₹234.65 and ₹247. Even on Friday, after appreciating to the resistance at ₹247, the stock could not hold on and gave up most of its gains towards the end of the session. The scrip closed the week at ₹238.05. Hence, for the stock to start trending, it must either decisively break above ₹247 or below ₹234.6. In case the stock attracts buying interest and moves past the resistance at ₹247, it may appreciate towards the resistance band between ₹250 and ₹252. But if the stock slips below ₹234, the sell-off could intensify and the price might tumble to ₹224 levels.





Infosys (₹805)
The stock of Infosys was consolidating for the week after a mute opening on Monday. But on Friday, the stock price of the IT major slumped and it lost 1.9 per cent during the session. It closed below 21-day moving average, indicating a potential reversal in short-term trend. With a close at ₹805, the stock has also breached a support at ₹814, where the 38.2 per cent of Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bullish swing coincides. Currently, the fall is arrested by a support in the band between ₹800 and ₹804. The relative strength index has crossed below the mid-point of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence too shows weakness, indicating further depreciation. Hence, if the price breaks below ₹800, it could fall to the support at ₹793, where the important 61.8 Fibonacci retracement level coincides. The 50-day moving average is at ₹792, making that price area a significant support. But if the price recovers from the current level, it may rally to ₹814.





RIL (₹1254.35)
The stock price of Reliance Industries was trading without showing any trend till Thursday. However, on Friday, after making an intra-day low of ₹1,174.3, the stock price rose rapidly and closed at ₹1254.35. Intra-day gain of the stock stood at 6.4 per cent. It registered an intra-day high of ₹1,269.9, which is also the month-to-date high. That way, it has breached a considerable resistance at ₹1,240. The stock has also zoomed past both the 21- and 50-day moving averages. Hence, the prevailing positive sentiment opens the door for the stock to appreciate towards ₹1,300, which is a key level from a medium-term perspective. This is because beyond ₹1,300, the stock has the potential to turn the medium-term trend bullish. Alternatively, in a less likely scenario where the stock moderates from the current levels, the price band between ₹1,230 and ₹1,240 will act as a solid support, limiting the correction. The probability of the price declining below these levels is low.





Tata Steel (₹368.55)
The share price of Tata Steel looked unsteady as it began the week at ₹362 and slid to ₹342 levels, moving below the support at ₹350. On Friday though, on the back of broad-based buying, the stock price went up, reclaiming the previous week high of ₹379.5. Interestingly, the stock faced selling pressure towards the close of Friday’s session, giving up some of its gains and wrapped up for the week at ₹368.5. Comparing this with ₹367.3 — the previous week closing price — there is essentially not much change. Hence, it is reiterated that a close above ₹380 is a prerequisite for the stock to move to higher levels. Noticeably, both the relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator point upwards, indicating a build-up in positive sentiment. In such a case, the stock may appreciate to ₹395, beyond which it will face a hurdle at ₹400. But, if the stock is sold off from the current levels, it may decline to ₹350."

SBI opened the week strongly at ₹307.5 against the previous close of ₹301.7, up nearly 2 per cent. The stock appreciated further to a high of ₹316, briefly trading above the 50-day moving average. However, the stock reversed abruptly as it could not sustain the bullish momentum and the price began to decline, breaking below the key supports at ₹300 and ₹292.
Thus, the near-term outlook seems weak as rallies are sold-off. The relative strength index has dipped below the 50-mark, indicating weakness. On the downside, supports are at ₹273.7 and ₹267. Resistances are at ₹292 and ₹300. The next leg of trend can be expected only if the stock price breaks either to ₹300 or ₹267.
In case it goes above ₹300, the stock will face a hurdle at the resistance band between ₹305.1 and ₹307.6, beyond which it may potentially retest the ₹316 levels. But if the stock breaks below ₹267, the sell-off could intensify and the stock will most likely tumble to ₹260. The return last week was minus 6.2 per cent.





 
The stock price of ITC took a huge leap as it opened the week at ₹250 against the previous close of ₹238.05, which is a solid 5 per cent gain. It extended the rally and went on to make a high of ₹260.5. However, the stock could not move beyond that level and the price started to soften and slumped to ₹242.7, from where it bounced off from the 21-day moving average support.
Studying the chart, one can observe that the stock is consolidating sideways as the price oscillates in the band between ₹247 and the resistance band ₹258-260. If the stock manages to breach the upper limit of the range at ₹260, it is likely that it will appreciate towards ₹270 levels, beyond which there’s an immediate resistance at ₹273.
However, if the stock weakens and slides below the lower limit of the range, that is, ₹247, the price may depreciate to ₹240, below which it can even drop to ₹234 levels. Last week’s return was plus 6.5 per cent.





 
Infosys witnessed considerable selling immediately after the previous week opened. As a result, it tumbled below the key level at ₹800. A stronger rupee weighed down the stock. The fall extended to ₹741.9 before the stock recouped some if its losses, closing the week at ₹782.
Recoveries are strongly resisted by the price band between ₹793 and ₹800. Hence, the near-term outlook remains weak. It has also moved below the 50-day moving average, potentially shifting the medium-term trend to bearish. The RSI has dipped below the 50 midpoint and the moving average convergence divergence indicator too appears weak. So, if the scrip weakens below ₹781, it will most likely depreciate to ₹762.
A break below that level can intensify the bearish trend and the stock could dwindle to ₹725 levels. Alternatively, if the stock manages to post a recovery beyond the stiff resistance at ₹800, there will be a minor resistance at ₹814, beyond which it might move northwards to ₹850 levels over the medium term.





 
Following the bullish momentum, the stock price of Reliance Industries continued to gain throughout last week. The stock toppled the key resistance at ₹1,300, making the case stronger for further appreciation. The relative strength index is clearly favouring the bulls and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has come into the positive territory, denoting a strong prevailing uptrend.
Also, the stock price has broken above the falling trend-line resistance. The stock has posted gains for two consecutive weeks. All these imply that the stock is on a strong bull trend and is likely to continue appreciating in the coming sessions.
On the upside, the stock will face a minor resistance at ₹1,320, beyond which it could strengthen to ₹1,365 levels in the near term. On the other hand, if the stock undergoes a correction, ₹1,300 will act as a key immeidate support, below which the price could fall to ₹1,240 in the short term. The return last week was plus 4.4 per cent.





 
The share price of Tata Steel was consolidating last week, fluctuating between ₹360 and ₹380. Though the stock attempted to move past ₹380, it failed, as it was rejected by the 50-day moving average. Thus, the broader ₹345-380 range continues to control the trend.
The moving average convergence divergence indicator implies weakness and so is the relative strength index. But since the RSI remains in over-sold conditions, the chances of a major downtrend from the current levels stand reduced. But unless the stock invalidates the range, the direction of the next major trend will be indecisive. Hence, the near-term outlook seems sluggish.
If the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range, it may rise towards the resistance band between ₹395 and ₹400. Beyond those levels, it can move upwards to ₹440. But, if the stock breaches below ₹345, the support is at ₹330, below which the stock could test the psychological level of ₹300."
57,2019-09-29,Infosys,"Infosys in a medium-term uptrend
Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
I bought shares of Infosys at ₹726 and IGL at ₹303. I want to stay invested for long term.
Mukesh Jain
Infosys (₹782.3): The stock of Infosys has been in a long-term uptrend since taking support at ₹430 in August 2017.




 
While trending up, the stock had conclusively breached a key long-term resistance at ₹640 in mid-2018, which subsequently turned into a significant support level. Intermediate as well as the medium-term trends are up for the stock. However, the short-term trend has been down since registering a new high at ₹847 in early September. The stock is currently volatile with a downward bias. A strong fall below the key support level of ₹760 can drag the stock down to ₹730 and ₹700 levels.
An emphatic tumble below ₹700 will mar the medium-term uptrend and drag the stock to the vital long-term support between ₹640 and ₹650.
Investors with a long-term perspective can stay invested with a stop-loss at ₹610 levels. Only a decisive fall below ₹640 will mitigate the long-term uptrend. Next support levels are at ₹600 and ₹550.
On the upside, a conclusive rally above the immediate resistance at ₹800 will take the stock higher to ₹820 and ₹847 levels.
A further break above ₹847 can take the stock up to ₹900 in the long run. You can consider accumulating the stock in declines with a long-term stop-loss at ₹610.
Indraprastha Gas (₹347.1): In October 2018, the stock of Indraprastha Gas (IGL) took support at ₹215 and bottomed out. After that, it has been on a long-term uptrend. Medium- and short-term trends are up for the stock. But it is now testing a significant long-term resistance at ₹350. Also, it experiences selling pressure at higher levels.
Therefore, a short-term corrective decline can’t be ruled out at this juncture. The stock can decline to ₹325. A further fall below this base will mar the short-term uptrend and drag it lower to ₹300 over the medium term. Next key support is at ₹270. Being a long-term investor, you can consider averaging in declines with a stop-loss at ₹255 levels.
A break above ₹350 can take the stock up to ₹370. Further rally beyond ₹370 can pave way for an up-move to ₹400 in the long term.
That said, an emphatic fall below ₹270 will diminish the uptrend and drag the stock down to ₹250 and then to ₹220 levels in the long run. However, such a break below ₹270 appears unlikely at this juncture.

SBI in a strong bear grip (₹249.9)
The stock posted some recovery in the month of September by appreciating to ₹315 levels. However, the rally did not sustain, and the stock fell sharply from that level. During the past week, the price even slumped below a critical support at ₹267 and closed at ₹249.9, indicating that the next leg of trend is on the downside. The stock has been continuously falling and has registered back-to-back weekly loss. The daily relative strength index is below the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has entered the negative territory, meaning there might be more selling pressure. An immediate support is at ₹246. Below that, the sell-off could intensify, potentially dragging the price to the support band between ₹230 and ₹233. On the upside, the stock will face resistance at ₹260. If the stock manages to get past that level, it might move towards ₹267. Considering the scenario, traders can sell the stock on rallies with a stop-loss above ₹267. The stock posted a weekly loss of 11 per cent.
 





 
ITC holds on to its gain (₹257.2)
There was not much volatility in the ITC stock last week. The stock briefly traded beyond the ₹247-260 range, but eventually moved back into the range after facing a hurdle at ₹263 — 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bear trend. The stock has closed in the green for the second week in a row, though the gain was marginal. It should also be noted that the stock continues to trade above both the 21- and 50-day moving averages, implying a bullish bias. The daily relative strength index is above the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence indicator looks steady in favour of the bulls. The stock seems to be trading with a bullish bias. However, the price might soften further before breaking on the upside. Hence, one can initiate long positions either at ₹250 levels or beyond ₹260 with a stop-loss below the lower boundary of the range at ₹247. Look for target between ₹270 and ₹273, which is a considerable resistance zone. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1.7 per cent.
 





 
Infosys moves in sideways range (₹793.4)
The price action of Infosys stock is sluggish and seems to be trading sideways. The stock attempted to break above the critical resistance at ₹800 but failed . Noticeably, the price has been oscillating between ₹781 and ₹800 for the past seven trading sessions. Also, it could not move past the dynamic 50-day moving average resistance which is currently coinciding with the resistance at ₹800, making it more significant. Unless the stock invalidates the sideways trend, the next leg of the trend will be unclear. The moving average convergence divergence indicator is showing signs of weakness, but the relative strength index seems to be recovering. However, only a breakout beyond ₹800 will take the stock price higher. If it gets past ₹800, it will face a minor resistance at ₹814. Above that, the price could rally towards ₹850 . Alternatively, if stock price dips below ₹781, it will decline further to ₹762. A break below ₹762 will intensify sell-off and the stock price could dwindle to ₹740 level. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1.4 per cent.
 





 
Reliance above key support (₹1,308.1)
The share price of Reliance Industries did not change much compared to the previous week and witnessed low volatility. The opening price and closing price were at the same level, meaning a doji candlestick in the weekly chart. It denotes a temporary indecisiveness on the direction of the trend during the past week. However, the bullish trend in the stock looks solid and as long as it trades above the key support at ₹1,300, the chances for price moving northwards is high. There is no weakness observed in the relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator seems to be steady. Hence, any correction in price can be used as an opportunity to initiate long positions. It is likely to move up to ₹1,365 and ₹1,400 levels, testing the life-time high of the stock. Stop-loss can be set below the immediate support at ₹1,300, because if the stock undergoes a correction, that level will perhaps arrest the decline. Below that level, subsequent support can be seen at ₹1,240.
 





 
Tata Steel poised to decline further (₹333.1)
Tata Steel witnessed selling pressure last week and the price broke below the lower boundary of the ₹345-380 range that had been holding the stock for the past three weeks. The break down opens the door for further weakness in the stock. It has pierced below the 21-day moving average as well. The daily relative strength index stays below the mid-point level of 50, where the moving average convergence divergence indicator is in the negative territory. All this could indicate that the stock might attract more selling pressure in upcoming trading sessions. Even though the stock currently hovers around a support at ₹330, traders with short-term and medium-term perspective can sell it on rallies. Below that level, the price will most probably depreciate to the psychological level of ₹300 in the short term. The support comes in at ₹280 levels. However, if the stock moves up from the current levels, rallies could be capped between ₹345 and ₹360. It posted a weekly loss of 7.3 per cent."

54,2019-10-12,Infosys,"Infosys weathers global macro headwinds
IT major Infosys posted a 6.2 per cent rise in consolidated net profit in the September quarter at ₹4,073 crore compared to the quarter ended June, helped by good performance of financial services, manufacturing and energy, and utility segments. The company seems to have weathered the global macro-economic slowdown with revenues growing 3.8 per cent quarter-on-quarter to ₹22,629 crore helped by growth in Europe and North America.
The company reported earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins of 21.7 per cent during the quarter compared to 20.5 per cent in the June quarter. This is near the middle of its 2019-20 margin guidance of 21-23 per cent. During the quarter ended September, Infosys won $2.8 billion worth of projects compared to $ 2.7 billion in the June quarter. Infosys upped the lower band of its revenue growth guidance to 9-10 per cent from 8.5-10 per cent.
Financial services segment saw revenues rise 4.2 per cent quarter on quarter, faster than the growth seen during the June quarter. Manufacturing segment saw revenues rise by 7.9 per cent compared to a fall of 1.8 per cent during the quarter. This shows that despite the global macro-economic slowdown, the company is posting good revenue growth.
Despite a robust performance overall during the quarter, the slowdown did show up in the company’s retail segment’s performance. Revenue from retail segment fell 1.4 per cent during the quarter to $488 million. This segment usually bears the impact of macro-economic slowdown, the company’s management said. Revenue from communication segment fell 2.7 per cent.
Most geographies performed well during the quarter ended September. There seems to have been no major impact of the slowdown in Europe on the company’s revenues from the region. Revenues from Europe grew 4.7 per cent in the September quarter compared to June.
The North American region saw revenue growth to slow a bit. In the quarter ended September, revenues from North America rose 2.2 per cent sequentially compared to 3 per cent in the June quarter. Rest of the world saw revenues falling 3.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter, while India revenues posted a 20.4 per cent sequential growth rise during the quarter.
With a robust pipeline of projects, and an upgrade in the revenue guidance, Infosys ended the first half of 2019-20 better than TCS."

India’s top three IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro — have significantly increased their net employee hiring in the September quarter compared with the previous quarter. The three companies together hired 28,157 employees (net) compared with 16,687 in the first quarter, an increase of 59 per cent.
The increased hiring comes in the backdrop of better business forecast. The hiring, which started to decline from the third quarter of last year, started to gain traction in the first quarter of this fiscal. In the second quarter, it rose further.
Industry leader TCS saw the highest hiring in the September quarter, breaking its own record. The company’s net addition of 14,097 employees was the highest ever in a quarter — breaking the previous record of 12,356 employees set in Q1.
 





 
Sanjeev Hota, Head of Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said: “IT companies see good demand environment going ahead. Deal wins have been robust in the last few quarters. Localisation initiatives in key geographies is also driving recruitment.”
“Our order-book and deal pipeline are very well distributed across verticals and geographies, which gives us confidence from a medium- to long-term perspective,” Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and MD, TCS, told financial analysts while discussing the company’s second-quarter results last week.
“We have been building capacity and gearing up for growth. Our investments in organic talent development continue to help us build up unmatched scale and depth in new technologies. As of September 30, we have trained over 3,22,000 employees in emerging technologies and over 3,91,000 employees in agile methodologies,” V Ramakrishnan, CFO, TCS, added.
Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys, said that the company delivered another strong quarter in Q2, and the performance was robust across multiple domains. The company reported double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter; strong growth in digital; improvement in operational parameters, especially employees utilisation and onsite-offshore mix; large deal signings; and reduction in attrition.
“The hiring is consistent with what we have done in the past. So I do not see any material change to that. Our hiring will be dependent on the growth and we have already factored that in the guidance,” said Pravin Rao, Chief Operating Officer, Infosys."

Infosys’ Q2FY20 results were a mixed bag with modest revenue miss negated by EBIT margin beat. Post modest 2Q revenue miss, we model Infosys dollar revenue growth at 10/10.2 per cent for FY20/FY21E (vs 10.6 per cent/9.8 per cent modelled earlier). Cross currency headwind and modest 2Q revenue miss leads us to marginally trim FY20 dollar revenue growth assumption.
Infosys dollar revenue growth for FY20E would be 8.7 per cent and rest from Stater acquisition (TCS dollar revenue growth estimate at 6.6 per cent for FY20E). Hence, Infosys could outpace TCS on organic dollar revenue growth for FY20E. Steady 2Q margin execution and factoring a modest rupee depreciation (versus dollar) compared to earlier assumptions negates headwinds from dollar revenue downgrade. Hence, our EBIT margin and EPS estimates of Infosys remain intact. While Infosys appears to be showing better revenue momentum, we expect TCS EBIT margin for FY20E at 24.7 per cent which would be about 300 bps higher than Infosys (which is 21.7 per cent). Hence, we believe Infosys could continue to trade at 10 per cent discount to TCS. Retain Add."

 The September 2019 quarter has brought good tidings for both Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys.
Both the firms reported a record Total Contract Value (TCV) — the size of deal struck with customers — of $9.2 billion (combined). TCV reflects an IT company’s ability to win large deals, including renewals.
TCS reported a TCV of $6.4 billion in Q2 — the highest in the last six quarters. Similarly, Infosys recorded a TCV of $2.8 billion, the highest-ever for the company. 
Wipro has not provided the deal numbers. These numbers suggest that the environment is turning positive for the IT sector. 
Sanjeev Hota, Head of Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said that early investments, ability to stitch together large multi-service deals, and participation in clients’ digital transformation journey are the factors that helped TCS win large deals. 
He added that Infosys had made incremental investments in people and digital capabilities in the previous year, which is yielding results now.
Both Infosys and TCS are doing well in terms of deal wins. “We believe that this is a confirmation of the strong order booking for offshore IT services players as digital spending is becoming mainstream and global corporates are investing in terms of their mid-office and back-office transformation,” said an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services. 
The analyst added: “The Tier-1 players have been talking about increased scope and size of deals over the past 18-24 months and the order intake numbers announced in September quarter are a validation of the same.” 
TCS’ CEO Rajesh Gopinathan shared the same view at a recent analysts call. 
“The strong order closure and deal pipeline is an indicator of our growing traction within the customer innovation spends. Our investments in research and innovation and our large portfolio of intellectual property are positioning us well to help customers scale up their innovation efforts,” he said.
Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys, told analysts while discussing the financial results that client metrics remained strong with the company adding 96 new clients during the quarter. 



Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys    -  PTI

After a subdued opening, the stock of SBI rallied in the end of last week and broke out of the range between ₹246 and ₹262. The price is testing the 21-day moving average which falls at around ₹270. The daily relative strength index indicates a bullish divergence and the moving average convergence divergence indicator, too, shows an uptick.
The short-term outlook of the stock is bullish, which could lead it higher to ₹275 level, a resistance that coincides with the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bear trend.
Above that level, the medium-term trend of the stock will turn bullish and attract more buyers, which could lift the price to ₹290 in the coming sessions.
Above that ₹300 — a psychological level — is the next hurdle. On the other hand, if stock cannot hold on to the bullish momentum and the price corrects, the supports will be at ₹262 and ₹267. The stock posted a weekly gain of nearly 6 per cent.





The stock price of ITC traded sluggish the past week trading in a tight range between ₹243 and ₹247. After a significant fall in the preceding week, the stock could not post a recovery and was resisted strongly at ₹247. Since the major trend is bearish, the stock will have difficulty breaking out of that level.
The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator is flat and do not indicate any bias. The price of ₹247 is also coincides with the 50-day moving average, and the 21-day moving average lies at ₹249, making the price area between ₹247 and ₹249 a significant resistance zone.
Since the stock has formed a good base at ₹243, it is not recommended to approach the stock with a negative bias. If the price breaches either ₹243 or ₹249. A breakout will result in the stock moving towards ₹253, whereas a break-down will result in the stock declining to the previous low of ₹234. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1 per cent.





After breaking out of the range between ₹780 and ₹800 on the upside, Infosys opened the week significantly lower. But further decline in the price was arrested by a support at ₹760, coincided by the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous uptrend. Importantly, the 21-day moving average has gone below the 50-day moving average, suggesting the possibility of the medium-term trend becoming bearish.
A significant weakness is observed in the moving average convergence divergence indicator. One can also observe a head- and-shoulders pattern in the daily chart, which is an indication of trend reversal. A close below ₹760 on a daily basis will confirm the pattern and result in the stock tumbling to ₹673, as projected by the pattern. Noticeably, the stock has a support at ₹725.
On the other hand, if the stock takes support at ₹760 and moves up, it will face a hurdles at ₹780 and at ₹800. The stock posted a weekly loss of 5.8 per cent.





The stock of Reliance Industries had a muted start as it traded flat during the first half. In the latter half, the stock resumed its stellar rally and marked a new life-time high of ₹1,427.9 on Friday. With a close at ₹1,416.3, it has breached the ₹1,400 mark and could potentially trigger the next leg of uptrend in the coming days.
The daily relative strength index has entered the over-bought territory, but the price action looks steady. The moving average convergence divergence indicator suggests considerable upward momentum. The medium-term trend of the stock is strongly bullish, and it can be bought on dips. On the upside, the stock has the potential to climb to ₹1,485, beyond which it will face a resistance at ₹1,500.
However, if the stock is subject to a correction on the back of profit-booking, ₹1,400 will offer a strong support. On further correction, a less likely scenario, the stock will find support at ₹1,365. The stock posted a weekly gain of 4.7 per cent.





The stock price of Tata steel rose last week after taking support at ₹340 levels. However, it stopped short of breaking the resistance at ₹360. But the price has closed above the 21- and 50-day moving averages, thereby raising the possibility of further ascent.
The daily relative strength index has crossed the midpoint level of 50 and one can also spot a bullish divergence, making the case stronger for the bulls. The moving average convergence divergence is also showing an uptick.
The current closing level is a resistance, and if the stock manages to break out and appreciate as a result of buying interest, it could advance to ₹380 in the coming days, beyond which it will face a hindrance in the form of a resistance band between ₹395 and ₹400. Alternatively, if the stock obeys the resistance at ₹360 and declines, it will decline to ₹345, below which the support is at ₹330. The stock posted a weekly return of about 6 per cent."

 InGovern, a proxy advisory firm, said that the whistleblower’s allegations against Infosys are specific in nature, and the audit committee needs to investigate and give investors the correct picture. 
Shriram Subramanian, Managing Director of InGovern, said that last time, there was not much depth to the whistleblower complaint. But this time, the complaints are specific. 
“No two ways about it. It calls for urgent and express action,” he told BusinessLine. 
He said that if there are accounting irregularities, then the Board should take note of it. “Investors expect best practices from Infosys,” he added. Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SES), another proxy advisory firm, said that that companies are under extreme pressure to come out with better results quarter after quarter. 
“In the present day with high emphasis on governance, companies must volunteer information to show their conduct. Infosys did not make any major changes in the board despite several allegations earlier,” said JN Gupta, a co-founder and Managing Director of SES. 
“It is important to know the truth but going by the allegations made in the mail, it is quite clear that Infosys should conduct a thorough probe,” he said."
34,2019-10-23,Infosys,"India needs a centralised repository for lodging corporate whistle-blower complaints
On the face of it, the market cap destruction of over ₹50,000 crore suffered by Infosys after it revealed whistle-blower complaints about unethical management conduct from a group of anonymous employees may seem a little excessive. But the string of governance scandals that have rocked India Inc in recent years have left such an indelible mark on the investor psyche, that investors are today inclined to shoot and then ask questions, when governance allegations surface about any firm. Given that this is not the first time that Infosys is dealing with whistle-blower complaints, it has a well-established process to deal with them. Its audit committee, shorn of its CEO and CFO (who figure in the complaint), is now investigating the matter. However, the same cannot be said for much of India Inc. Though whistle-blower complaints have been critical to blowing the lid off many a corporate scandal in India — from the conflict of interest allegations that claimed the career of ICICI Bank’s CEO to the dubious lending at PMC Bank — the legal system does little to nurture a culture of insiders calling out corporate fraud.
The laws enabling corporate whistle-blowing in India are quite loosely drafted. Section 177(9) of the amended Companies Act of 2013 requires all listed companies and those accepting public deposits or having material borrowings to establish a vigil mechanism for directors or employees to report fraudulent or unethical behaviour. But how this mechanism will operate is left open-ended, with companies merely required to provide an email ID to lodge complaints. Resolution is left to the discretion of the company and anonymous complaints are actively discouraged. SEBI’s LODR Regulations go a little farther by tasking audit committees with reviewing the whistle-blower mechanism. But they fail to specify any process for complaint resolution. Even in cases where companies do have a proper whistle-blowing mechanism, complaints are often investigated by the in-house audit committee. Given how pliant independent directors on corporate boards tend to be in the Indian context, it seems a tall ask to expect the audit committee to protect the identity of the whistle-blower or to nail the culprits. In many cases, forensic audits commissioned by the regulator have unearthed substantial evidence of fraud after perpetrators were exonerated by in-house audit committees. This imperfect situation leads to whistle-blowers taking their complaints to the media where they can get widely disseminated before being proved, opening the doors to wealth destruction and market manipulation.
Establishing a centralised whistle-blower mechanism under the auspices of the market regulator appears to be the best way to solve this problem. The Office of the Whistle-blower under the US SEC has been quite successful at unearthing corporate frauds since its inception in 2010. SEBI has recently mooted an ‘informant’ mechanism for reporting cases of insider trading. There’s no reason why this shouldn’t be extended to whistle-blowing on all legal and corporate governance infractions in listed firms."

Infosys had posted a good set of numbers in second quarter of the fiscal, much better than its nearest competitor, TCS Vivek Prakash


Infosys had posted a good set of numbers in second quarter of the fiscal, much better than its nearest competitor, TCS Vivek Prakash

The Infosys stock faced a shocker this week and crashed by 16 per cent on Tuesday morning. The reason was a letter from a whistleblower group that accused the CEO of unethical practices.
But after registering a low of ₹615.1 on Wednesday, which is a 10-month low, the stock is trying to stabilise.
Infosys has strong support in the ₹618 and ₹638 band, which has cushioned its recent decline. The 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the prior bull trend coincides at ₹638, making it a significant level.
But the reversal from this support zone has not been too convincing so far. There is immediate resistance at ₹675. The inability to move beyond this level will imply that the stock could turn weak and test its 52-week-low of ₹599.8 in the coming days, before declining to ₹590.
But a move above Rs 675 can take it to ₹700, and beyond that to Rs 760.
Traders with a short-term perspective can go long on a move above Rs 675, with a tight stop-loss.

Fresh short positions can be initiated if the stock declines below Rs 600.
The Infosys stock has been on a strong uptrend over the past one year. From a low of ₹599.8 in November 2018, the stock has appreciated by about 40 per cent and marked a life-time high of ₹847 in September 2019. It gradually declined from those levels and closed at ₹767.8 last Friday.
The reason for the current bout of weakness was a couple of letters sent by whistleblowers to the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). One dated September 20 was sent on September 27. The other, an undated letter with proof for the claim, was sent to the SEC on October 3.
The letters were also sent to the company on September 30. The company released a statement on October 21, which states that the company has received anonymous whistleblower complaints and the same have been placed before the Audit Committee in line with the company’s practice.
With the investigation by various institutions, including the SEBI, internal audit committee and the US SEC, currently in progress, it might be too soon to bet on a sustained bounce back. Further revelations can trigger a new wave of down-side."

Fresh allegations against Infosys from a group of employees who call themselves “Ethical Employees’’ will certainly hurt the company but what is more significant about these charges is that this group’s claim that they have enough documentary evidence to nail any denial from the company.
One can immediately draw parallels to the scandal involving Satyam Computers with regard to certain allegations, especially those concerning manipulating figures to artificially boost profits and revenues but then, Infosys has built for itself a solid reputation for corporate governance.

The allegations must have been completely unexpected considering Infosys had posted a good set of numbers during the second quarter of the fiscal - much better than its nearest competitor, TCS. The Tata-owned company’s second-quarter earnings were lower than expected while Infosys’ profits met analyst estimates and were ahead in terms of sequential growth and margin.
Podcast | Infosys whistleblower: What next for Salil Parekh?
Harit Shah, a research analyst, Reliance Securities, said that while one awaits developments on the board investigation, it is likely that some investors will vote with their feet and sell at least some of their holdings. The market is very unforgiving of companies that have corporate governance issues and while it would not be fair to directly jump to conclusions, this issue appears quite ugly, he said. Another analyst said that prima facie, the allegations do not appear to be very strong and Infosys should take note of this.
The allegations can be classified into three buckets. Firstly, allegations about how certain measures were taken up in the current quarter to boost short-term revenue and profits. Secondly, how certain figures and facts were kept hidden from the board as well as the auditors. Thirdly, the role played by the CFO to allow the CEO to indulge in “unethical practices,” and how large deals approvals are full of irregularities.
The claims made by the whistleblower group will stand up to scrutiny only if there is clinching evidence. But what remains to be seen is how fast Infosys moves to constitute an independent probe and if the allegations are true, sets an example to win back investors’ confidence."

While the two officers denied indulging in such practices, the board decided to probe the allegations and hired law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas to carry out an independent inquiry. The probe will also cover past top management.
In a notice to Infosys, the BSE said the company has not made any disclosure under Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015, about the whistleblower, and sought clarification from the software major.
A whistleblower group, in a letter dated September 20, 2019 letter — first emailed to the Infosys board on September Sept 30 but with no response emailed to the US market regulator SEC on October 3 — charged the top brass with among other things 1. Boosting short-term profits and bypassing reviews and approvals for large deals; 2. Not fully recognising costs, including visa fees; 3. pressuring employees to not recognise reversals of upfront payment; 4. Hiding critical information from auditors and the board; 5. Not sharing full information with auditors and investors, and 6. Not following accounting standards in revenue recognition.
In a note to investors, Morgan Stanley said that the latest development will weigh on the stock. It said that over the last two years, since Salil Parekh took over as CEO, positive momentum has been building up again, but the latest development may put the stock’s performance at risk.
Podcast | Infosys whistleblower: What next for Salil Parekh?
“The stock has been the best performer YTD within the large-cap IT space primarily due to revenue growth rates being better than peers. However, the recent 2Q results were slightly disappointing as growth in BFSI and Retail (47 per cent of revenue) was soft and the company refrained from increasing the revenue growth guidance at the upper end. Hence, given the relative outperformance through this year and valuations above its historical average, we believe this new development could further weigh on the stock,” it said.
In its note, Jefferies said that as it awaits clarity from the management and more concrete evidence from the whistleblowers, the issue is likely to overhang on the stock in the near-term given that it raises questions about the credibility of the current management.

Board of Directors,

Respected Sir / Madam,
Disturbing unethical practices
We have high respect for all of you and bring to your notice the unethical practices of CEO in recent quarters. Same measures are taken up in current quarter also to boost short-term revenue and profits. We are Infosys employees and we have emails and voice recordings on these matters. We hope the board will conduct immediate investigation and take action.
In last quarter, we were asked not to fully recognise costs, like visa costs, to improve profits. We have voice recordings of these conversations. When auditor opposed, the issue was postponed. This quarter, there is a lot of pressure to not recognise reversals of $50 million of upfront payment in FDR contact, which is against accounting practice. As this will reduce profits for the quarter and negative for stock price, they are putting pressure not to take the charge.
Critical information is hidden from the auditors and board.
In large contracts like Verizon, Intel and JVs in Japan, ABN Amro acqusition, revenue recognition matters are forced which are not as per accounting standards. We have emails and voice recordings and we will share when investors ask us. We are asked not to share large deal information with auditors.
Large deals approvals have irregularities. The CEO is bypassing reviews and approvals and instructing sales not to send mails for approval. He directs them to make wrong assumptions to show margins. CFO is compliant and he prevents us from showing in board presentations large deal issues.
The CEO told us, “no one in the board understands these things. They are happy as long as share price is up. These two Madrasis (Sundaram and Prahalad) and Divya (Kiran) make silly points. You just nod and ignore them.” We have voice recordings of this.
Several billion dollars deals of last few quarters have nil margin. Please ask auditors to check deal proposals, undisclosed upfront commitments made and revenue recognition. All information is not shared with auditors.
The CEO spends two-and-half days in a week in the city and rest in Mumbai. All his travel expenses are paid by the company, for these weekly personal trips. He is greencard holder and avoids deduction of taxes during his US travel which is non-compliance. Please check and details will be provided.
In board meetings, we are told not to present data on large deals and important financial measures as it will get board attention. The CEO and the CFO are asking us to show more profits in treasury by taking up risks and make changes to policies. This will provide short-term profits. They ask us not to make key disclosures in 20 F and annual report and to share only good and incomplete information with investors and analysts. This is regulatory issue.
We have mails and voice records and will share during investigation Whoever disagrees is sidelined and many of them leave. In large deals finance team, important employees are left due to pressure to make deals look good.
We know you will take action and we await to provide details and evidence to investigators."

Podcast | Infosys whistleblower: What next for Salil Parekh?
 
In 2017 and 2018, a previous whistleblower had raised questions over corporate governance issues about Infosys. Indian regulator SEBI had even set up a probe committee to find out whether the allegations were true or not. 
Harit Shah, Research Analyst, Reliance Securities, said: It's very serious news indeed. This equates to a corporate governance issue. 
""Really disappointing that a company that has long been viewed as a ""poster boy"" of corporate governance in India has seemingly fallen to such levels. It calls into severe question board-level processes at the IT major, which is even more disappointing given that when founder Nandan Nilekani was brought back on the board, his specific focus was to ensure high corporate governance standards post the Vishal Sikka fiasco,"" he said in a statement. 
""While we await developments on the board investigation, given that it is so widely held, it is very likely that some investors will vote with their feet and sell at least some of their holdings. The market is very unforgiving of companies that have corporate governance issues and while it would not be fair to directly jump to conclusions, this issue appears quite ugly at least on the surface,"" he further added.
 
However, Equirus Capital said: ""We do not see any impact on near-term financials. A slowdown in 3Q due to higher-than-anticipated furloughs could impact earnings and remains a key risk"". Equirus Capital further said: ""We believe the whistleblower has mixed the accounting norms with business decisions. Large deal wins could be margin dilutive in the initial phase or might require upfront investment from vendors. In our view, this may be considered as customer acquisition cost. We like management’s revenue growth focus even if it is at the cost of margins initially. Gaining wallet share cements the company’s position with vendors, and over a period provides a necessary cost rationalisation lever (lower SG&A to name one) to recoup margins"".
Any sharp fall in the share price post the allegations provides a good opportunity to invest, Eqirus said."
38,2019-10-28,Infosys,"Infosys shares tank; Nandan Nilekani says CEO Salil Parekh to be recused from probe
The Infosys stock on Tuesday bore the brunt of a whistleblower group’s allegations, which have rocked the company. The IT major’s shares tanked nearly 17 per cent, recording their worst single-day drop in six years, and wiping out nearly ₹53,000 crore in investors’ wealth.
The scrip tanked 16.21 per cent on the BSE. During the day, it tumbled 16.86 per cent to ₹638.30, the steepest fall since April 2013.
A whistleblower group has claimed in an email to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to the Infosys board, that the company’s CEO was indulging in unethical practices.
In an attempt to contain the damage, the company’s non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani, in a statement to the BSE on Tuesday, said Infosys has recused CEO Salil Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy from the probe that it plans to conduct. Infosys has retained law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co to conduct an independent probe, he added.
The statement said that following a board meeting on October 11, the company’s Audit Committee began consultations with independent internal auditors EY on terms of reference for a prima facie investigation. It has now retained Shardul Amarchand to conduct an independent investigation, it added.
Podcast | Infosys whistleblower: What next for Salil Parekh?
Recounting the events, the statement said a board member received two anonymous complaints on September 30 — one dated September 20 and titled ‘Disturbing unethical practices’ and the second undated with the title, ‘Whistleblower complaint’.
“Pursuant to our whistleblower practice, we placed both complaints before the Audit Committee on October 10, 2019, and before the non-executive members of the board on October 11, 2019,” Nilekani said in the statement.
These complaints are being dealt with in an objective manner, he emphasised. Since the probe is ongoing, and needs to be conducted in a thorough and objective manner, there will be no further comment, he added. At an appropriate time, Infosys will provide a summary of the investigations results, he added.

The undated whistleblower complaint largely deals with allegations relating to Parekh’s travel to the US and Mumbai. Additionally, on October 16, the company was made aware of a letter dated October 3, which was purportedly written to the Office of Whistleblower Protection Program, Washington DC.
“This letter refers to the September 20, 2019 complaint, and to emails and voice recordings in support of the allegations. Although we have not been provided any of the emails or voice recordings, we will ensure that the generalised allegations are investigated to the fullest extent. Additionally, to ensure independence in these investigations, the CEO and CFO have been recused from this matter,” the statement said.
In another development, ‘global investor rights law firm’ The Rosen Law Firm, based in New York, has said it is investigating potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Infosys following the whistleblower complaint.
The Rosen Law Firm has, in its website, said it will file an action under the federal securities laws to recover damages and to seek other relief against Infosys. It will prosecute the action on a contingent fee basis and will advance all costs and expenses.
It has further asked those who have purchased Infosys shares to visit its website to join the class action."

Equirus Capital does not see any impact on near-term financials. ""We believe the whistleblower has mixed accounting norms with business decisions.

According to domestic broking firm Emkay Global, this will push investors towards TCS from Infosys. ""While we are not in a position to ascertain the truth of the allegations (note that Infosys has referred this matter to the Audit Committee which is investigating), the newsflow around this may dominate investor attention in the near term and could continue to support the shift toward TCS (especially after September'19 quarter results) despite Infosys' results being a tad better than TCS vs. Street expectations"".

He had quit enterprise software firm SAP to take up his role at Infosys.

 After a rather tumultuous week for Infosys, analysts are beginning to separate the wheat from the chaff with most suggesting that the whistleblower group’s allegations against the top management are also indicative of troubles elsewhere, particularly on the people/talent management front.
“Its inability to manage a massive flux at the top is perhaps the biggest reason for growing disgruntlement there. It has been going on for six years even though it has to be expected of a company which has been around for over 38 years,” said an analyst with a consultancy firm who was a former COO with one of the top-five IT companies. 
ICICI Securities in a note also said that what has exacerbated investor’s response to the whistleblower’s allegations was the absence of proactive disclosures by the company as well as the allegations not being looked at in isolation but also in the context of Ranganath Mavinakere (ex-CFO) and Jayesh Sanghrajka (Deputy CFO) moving on from the company recently. There has been no perceivable inconsistency in the key data points shared by Infosys, the report said. 
“However, looking at the allegations in isolation, some of the data points shared by Infosys, like Verizon deal being margin dilutive by 40bps or visa costs being a margin drag of 80bps in Q1FY20 or Stater deal being dilutive by 40bps, are consistent with the nature of these deals and investments in our opinion. Some of the key contracts should be seen as an investment made to build relationships,” said the report. 
Pointing out how key executives like Mohandas Pai, the former director and CFO had to leave Infosys because of the company’s inability to harness their leadership skills, the management consultant said exits have to be handled in a gracious manner. “But that hasn’t happened so far. It is not about an individual but about the manner in which such issues are handled,” he said. He also said that thanks to the Satyam fiasco and subsequent issues with the auditing firms, the bar has been raised very high. “Infosys has been a bellwether company. Practices like manipulating figures to boost profits are not possible,” he said.
An analyst writing for Seeking Alpha, a US-based crowd-sourced content service for financial markets, said that bigger concerns are the claims of inflated profits, hidden “critical information,” and under-reporting costs which can be detected depending on the relative magnitude of these irregularities. 
“On the first pass, not only are all the forensic and value algorithms not adverse at the top level, but they are in highly favourable conditions for low risk of manipulation, bankruptcy, and financial irregularities,” said JD Henning, an investment adviser. 
He added that it is unlikely the CEO’s international travel will turn up as an issue on the forensic and valuation models as an irregularity as these type of expenses would typically remain within sustainable operational parameters. 
According to all the forensic models applied, there’s no indication of alleged rampant financial irregularities spanning from 2013 to today in the Infosys’ financials. “The three-year period of adverse scoring in the Beneish M-score factor for asset quality does not appear to be consistent with what little we know about the whistleblower claims,” he said. 
Writing about the financials of the company, another analyst said that he expects Infosys to outperform the upper end of its revenue guidance in 2020. “Our current model calls for 10.6 per cent year on year revenue growth and the most recent earnings call didn’t give us reasons to soften our model,” said Alexander Veytsman, writing for Seeking Alpha."

The stock price of Infosys crashed and all kinds of rumours were doing the rounds on social media.
   -  Reuters

A lot of drama surrounded the whistleblower allegation against Infosys’s top management this month. The stock price crashed and all kinds of rumours were doing the rounds on social media. One particular rumour concerned an insider taking large positions in put options at the strike price of ₹740, before the whistleblower complaint.
Read more: Whistleblower group accuses Infosys CEO of 'unethical practices' to boost numbers
Some sections of the media did stories on this and the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is also reported to be probing the buildup of this derivatives position.
But a closer look shows that these allegations may not have any substance. Put options in Infosys have seen similar sized positions consistently over the last two years. This points towards hedging or some other motive behind the option position and not necessarily insider trading.
It was one particular option contract i.e. November 740 PE, which is the November series 740 strike put option that caught everyone’s eyes.
It all started with whistleblowers sending a couple of letters to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging the CEO of “unethical practices”. The first letter was sent on September 27 and the second, a follow-up letter, on October 3. These letters were then sent to the company as well, on September 30. The company released a statement on October 21 saying that it has received anonymous whistleblower complaints and the same has been placed with the audit committee as per company practices.
The stock price of Infosys crashed 16 per cent on October 22, resulting in the premium of 740 PE increasing to ₹103.3 from ₹16.9, a whopping 511 per cent gain in just one day. While the fall in stock price and heavy turnover volumes in derivatives is not out of the ordinary, social media became active about suspicious building up of positions of 740 PE, before the event.
Related news: Infosys: Go short only below Rs 600
On September 25, 1501 lots (amounting to 18 lakh shares as 1 lot of Infosys derivative contract comprise of 1200 shares) were added to the open interest of 740 PE. This triggered a barrage of questions. But is this the first time that unusual volumes have been witnessed in the derivative contract of Infosys? Not really, going by recent derivatives data that is available with the exchanges.
On checking the historical data of options contract of Infosys, it is revealed that such buildup of derivatives contracts happens frequently in the stock. On July 16, 1522 lots of OI (18.2 lakh shares) was opened in September series 740 PE. It may be argued that insiders might have gotten hold of the information earlier. But tracing back further, data reveals that on April 16, 1666 lots of OI (20 lakh shares) was opened in June series 680 PE.
A couple of strikes in April series (700 and 730) too had such large positions initiated. But the difference here is that the position was built up in two tranches in each of the strikes. 700 PE saw its OI added by 790 lots (9.5 lakh shares) on Feb 13 and by 931 lots (11.2 lakh shares) on April 12; whereas 730 PE saw its OI increase by 775 lots (9.3 lakh shares) on February 11 and by 368 lots (4.4 lakh shares) on March 26. At some stage the total open contracts in 700 PE was 1721 lots (20.6 lakh shares) and in 730 PE was 1143 lots (13.7 lakh shares).
Such volumes are seen in the previous year as well where the 2019 February series 620 PE witnessed an OI creation of 1336 lots (16 lakh shares) on December 10, 2018. Also, huge positions were built in a couple of strikes in December series. The December series 620 PE and 670 PE witnessed an OI creation of 1241 lots and 1246 lots respectively i.e. nearly 15 lakh shares each.
One difference between the November 740 PE with other options that we discussed is that, in all other scenarios the option expired worthless (exception being 2018 December 670 PE whose last traded price on the date of expiry was ₹12.6) on the day of expiry. In the current scenario, the probability of option expiring deep in-the-money is more i.e. the option will have relatively higher value on the expiry day.
All these data suggest that, one cannot conclude about a potential insider trading purely based on the large open interest in Infosys put options when the whistleblower news was released.
One among many possible reasons for the open interest could be that some large funds are hedging their underlying position in Infosys stock with these put contracts. And as we can notice, the consistency in position size also points towards it being a hedging position.
Importantly, had it been insider trading, the contract would have most likely seen a liquidation, when the premium shot up. But the open interest as on October 30 is still 19 lakh shares. The option has gone deep in the money during the period, increasing the option price multiple times, every reason for any trader to book profit and exit.
Since SEBI has mandated physical settlement of stock derivatives for all stocks from October 2019, it would be interesting to see how the unwinding takes place, if it happens, as the option in question is currently in-the-money."

UB Pravin Rao, Chief Operating Officer, Infosys
   -  Bloomberg


UB Pravin Rao, Chief Operating Officer, Infosys
   -  Bloomberg

For a few years now, Infosys has been living from one whistleblower complaint to another. This time, however, a whistleblower group has made allegations that seem to be far more serious than the previous ones. In an interaction with BusinessLine, Infosys Chief Operating Officer, UB Pravin Rao shares the company’s perspective about such complaints and how they have not affected its regular operations. Excerpts
Infosys has said that there is no prima facie evidence to suggest any wrongdoings as claimed by a whistleblower group. So, is this statement based on an interim report?
This is just a clarification. We were asked by the stock exchange whether there was any evidence. We clarified that no evidence was shared with us. We responded to whatever question was asked by the stock exchange. But the probe is continuing and till the report is out, we will not be able in any position to share the details.
Are there any timeline set for the panel to complete the probe?
No, we have not set any timeline because we want to make sure that it is comprehensive and we don’t want to compromise on the nature of the probe. Obviously, everyone wants the report out sooner than later. But we are not putting any pressure to complete it in a time-bound manner. We want to make sure they do a comprehensive job.
On a long-term basis, how do you see such allegations panning out for all the stakeholders?
Whatever has happened is quite unfortunate. We would rather not have these kinds of things playing out. In the past as well as now, we have shown that we are a resilient organisation and we have made sure that it doesn’t impact or distract us from doing what is right for our clients and in terms of executing the strategy and that’s what we are probably doing. We reached out to stakeholders including our own employees. We talked to them about what we are doing with respect to this allegation. We have reassured them that there are no changes as far as our ties with them are concerned. There is absolutely zero impact as far all our stakeholders are concerned. Our commitment to them, our deliverables will be on the same scale as before. They will continue to see Infosys being as proactive as before and helping them in their own transformation. We have told them there will be no disruptions to what we do with your clients and there are many who have been with us for the last 15-20 years. They do understand the DNA of the company.
Infosys is now 38 years old. Analysts say Infosys might have lost its nimbleness with age catching up
It is a journey. In the earlier days when it was a smaller company, it was easier to be agile; there was the energy of the start-up and not burdened with the processes. But once you start growing, it is important not to lose sight of nimbleness. The ideal situation would be to be a large company with a start-up culture. But it is easier said than done. We make sure that we keep re-imagining the processes. Basically, what we are seeing is our ability to react to situations much faster. But today with technology automation and AI, it is possible for an organisation to also start embedding some of these things into its own processes, and react in a much more agile manner.
One criticism against the company is that it has not harnessed the kind of experience some of the senior and older employees in key positions bring to the table. There have been quite a few exits at the top level.
If you look at our overall attrition rate, most of it comes at lower levels, especially between three and five years. Beyond five years, our attrition level is lower than the overall attrition. Even at the senior positions, the exits are fewer. Thankfully, most of the exits have been for reasons where people have got better opportunities or left on their own to pursue their own passion which may not be in line with what Infosys is doing. We have rarely seen regrettable talent leaving us to join peers for similar kind of work. We want to make sure that we retain the best talent, but at the same time if there are exits it also creates an opportunity for the next level of employees. We are not really alarmed or really worried about the the level of attrition at the middle and senior level.
How active is the leadership institute at Mysuru Mysore?
I think it is evolving and is keeping pace with the changing times. Earlier, it was more about going to Mysuru and getting trained there but today our training methodology has changed. You don’t really need to go there to get trained. There are multiple interventions. We have tied up with some of the global academics like Stanford. Some of our top leaders attend these tailor-made intervention programmes. We are also connecting senior leaders with mentors from outside who are CEOs and business leaders from other organisations. We also drive a lot of internal initiatives for potential leaders.
The Q2 performance of Infosys was, in fact, better than some of its peers. But if one looks at sector-wise analysis, financial services is expected to be soft on the back of weakness in capital markets. Retail is expected to be volatile led by caution in spending.
There are some pockets of weakness in the capital markets and some of the banks in Europe but we have a broad-based portfolio. We work across geographies. We remain reasonably confident about this space. We have had a strong position there and we have won several deals and a big percentage of that has come from financial services. And again, there is a lot of concern about macro consumer spending and we expect it to be a little bit volatile. This quarter is important for retail from a holiday season. If this quarter pans out well then hopefully some spend may come back next year depending on how this holiday season works out but retail is one sector which will always remain volatile because it is closely tied to the consumer sentiment and consumer spending but barring these two, I think we have seen good performance in other sectors.
Are clients being wary about spending more because of the fear of recession which many feel is around the corner?
Well, there is a general talk about it but we are not seeing any impact in any decision-making from a client perspective. In the last year and a half, one thing is common. Clients are looking at taking cost out and repurposing that spend in newer areas, in the discretionary areas because it is important for them to transform themselves for them to survive and be competitive against the digital natives. That behaviour still continues. So far, we have not seen any impact on client spending."

Infosys has said there is no prima facie evidence that the company has received to corroborate any of the allegations made in the whistleblower group complaint against the company CEO.
In a statement to the NSE, Infosys said there is no supporting evidence that has been received by the company along with these anonymous complaints to substantiate the allegations. “Unless an event / information is deemed ‘material’ under the LODR (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, or determined as ‘material’ by the company, the company has no obligation to disclose the same under Regulation 30 of the LODR Regulations.
Sriram Subramaniam, MD and founder of proxy advisory and corporate governance firm, InGovern, said the clarification does not disclose much. “The statement actually confuses investors. At this juncture, there was no need to say that no prima facie evidence is found. It is as if they are trying to influence the ongoing investigation when it should be out anyday,” he pointed out.
Infosys said the anonymous complaints do not fall within the purview of deemed material events under the LODR Regulations. Further, given the circumstances at this stage, where there is complete absence of prima facie evidence and the anonymous complaints are still under investigation, the company is not in a position to determine the concreteness, credibility and materiality of the anonymous complaints. In light of the above, no disclosure under Regulation 30 of the LODR Regulations is required to be made.
The Audit Committee has retained the services of the law firm, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, to investigate the matter. Moreover, even before the appointment of the independent investigator the Audit Committee began consultations with independent internal auditors Ernst & Young. The independent internal auditors were given a mandate to review certain processes on the basis of the allegation in the anonymous complaints.
“As requested, we will update the stock exchanges on the basis of key findings of the investigation reports once these are concluded,” he said. The anonymous complaints make certain allegations. Two of the anonymous complaints were received on September 30. On October 16, the company was made aware of a letter that refers to September 30 complaint purportedly written to the Office of Whistleblower protection program, Washington D.C.
For an event/information to warrant a disclosure, unless it is specifically listed as a deemed material event, the event/information needs to be disclosed only if determined by a company to be material.
Following the clarification, Infosys stock price ended the day at ₹710.10, about 3.3 per cent higher than the previous closing price."

The stock of SBI climbed throughout the past week, crossing an important level of ₹300; it even registered a 13-week high of ₹317.8 on Thursday. Noticeably, it has moved past ₹309, the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. After closing at ₹313.5, the stock is currently trading at a resistance in the band between ₹309 and ₹315. But the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator continue to indicate a bullish bias and the medium-term outlook of the stock is positive. So, with the current momentum, the stock will most likely break out of ₹315 and move up towards ₹335. Note that before ₹335, the stock could face a minor resistance at ₹324, the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. A daily close above ₹315 will confirm a higher peak, which could reinforce the existing bullish momentum. On the other hand, if the stock undergoes a correction on profit-booking, it has supports at ₹300 and ₹292. The stock has returned an impressive 15.3 per cent for October.
 





 
The stock of ITC gained during the past week after facing a sell-off in the week before. The stock currently faces strong resistance at ₹263 – also substantiated by the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend. Though the daily chart shows that attempts to break ₹263 for the past three trading sessions have failed, the 21-day moving average has crossed over the 50-day moving average, indicating a shift in the medium-term trend. Also, bullishness is exhibited by the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator. So, on the back of it, if the stock closes above ₹263 on daily basis, it will confirm a higher peak and will attract fresh buying interest, lifting the stock price further. On the upside, it will face resistances at ₹269 and ₹274. On the contrary, if the stock faces selling pressure, it will find immediate support at ₹258. But a break below that level could drag the stock to ₹250 over the medium term. Despite high volatility, the stock closed flat in October.
 





The Infosys stock was impacted by negative news and the price tumbled by a record level and even registered an 11-month low of ₹615.1. The 21-DMA has crossed below the 50-DMA; the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are pointing downwards making the medium-term outlook weak. However, the stock price recovered over the past week and managed to close at ₹687.9, above the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of ₹638. But only a break above ₹700 can lead to a sustainable recovery. Over the medium term, it is highly probable that the stock will consolidate within a broad range of between ₹620 and ₹700. In case the sentiment shifts in favour of the stock resulting in the breakout of ₹700, it will face hindrances at ₹745 and ₹760. Alternatively, if the price breaches the support at ₹620, it will test the 52-week low at ₹599.8. Below that level, the sell-off could accelerate, potentially pulling down the price to ₹575. The stock plunged 14.9 per cent in October.
 





Reliance Industries (RIL) continued its uptrend, hitting record high in the past week. The stock registered a new all-time high of ₹1,489.65 on Thursday and closed with significant gains for the third consecutive month. Though the bulls appear to be in control, there are some concerns which can be observed in the price action. The bearish divergence is visible in the weekly relative strength index (RSI), whereas the daily RSI is hovering in the over-bought territory after seven months. The moving average convergence divergence indicator also shows a bearish divergence in the weekly time-frame. These factors call for caution as the stock might witness a price correction. So, if the stock declines, ₹1,400 will act as a support. A break below that level could drag the stock to ₹1,360. But if the stock continues with the current bullish trend, it is highly likely that it will appreciate to ₹1,500. The stock gave a return of 10 per cent October.





 
A recovery in the stock price of Tata Steel accelerated last week as it cracked above a key resistance at ₹380 and closed at ₹399.8, testing the psychological level of ₹400. But the price has already confirmed a higher peak and the 21-day moving average is attempting to cross over the 50-day moving average – a bullish signal. The stock has also moved past the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous swing at ₹395, paving the way for further appreciation. The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are signalling a substantial bullish momentum. Importantly, the price action has developed a double bottom chart pattern on the daily chart, which already stands confirmed. The stock will face a resistance at ₹418, beyond which it has the potential to move towards ₹440. However, if the price level of ₹400 manages to hinder the gains, it could decline to the supports at ₹380 and ₹360. The stock gained 5.5 per cent in October."

Infosys will provide end-to-end IT infrastructure transformation of SGRE
   -  Reuters

 IT services major Infosys on Monday said it has inked a long-term partnership with Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) to support the latter’s digital transformation journey.
Infosys will provide end-to-end IT infrastructure transformation of SGRE, including hybrid cloud transformation, roll-out of a software defined network, set-up of an intelligent service desk, and digital workplace services, according to a statement.
 No financial details of the deal were disclosed.
 Usage of Infosys Infrastructure Management Solution Suite will enable faster time to market with service catalogue-based offering across all IT infrastructure for SGRE, the statement said.
 “Leveraging our innovative solutions, domain knowledge and a clear comprehension of SGRE’s business strategy, we look forward to enabling their core modernisation, enhancing cloud capabilities and consolidating disparate and heterogeneous infrastructure and processes into a single SGRE global standard,” Infosys Executive Vice-President and Global Head of Manufacturing Jasmeet Singh said.
 Alan Feeley, Chief Information Officer at SGRE, said when considering its desired IT operating model, the company was looking for a partner that brought a “careful balance of innovation, operational excellence and sustainable commercial viability”.
 “With Infosys, we are very confident that these attributes are at the core of their operating culture,” he added."
20,2019-11-05,Infosys,"Infosys’ 1.5-2 per cent involuntary attrition rate is par for the course: Salil Parekh
 Infosys has shed 1.5-2 per cent of its total workforce in each of the last two quarters, which it terms as involuntary attrition.
This works out to anywhere between 2,000 and 3,000 employees every quarter; basically, this is involuntary attrition and is based on the performance of each employee. 
In a post-earnings analyst call soon after the second quarterly results were announced, Infosys CEO, Salil Parekh said attrition had declined to 19.4 per cent, which included voluntary attrition of below 18 per cent. During the previous quarter, one of the top executives had said that involuntary attrition was higher compared to voluntary attrition. As of September this year, Infosys had a total of 2,36,489 employees, of which 2,21,851 are software engineers. In an email response, an Infosys spokesperson said: “As a high performance organisation, involuntary attrition is integral to normal course of business and this should not be interpreted as any mass trimming across any level in particular.”
In an earlier interaction with BusinessLine, Infosys COO UB Pravin Rao said there has been no mass firing of employees. “We added about 18,000 trainees from campuses in India last year. This year too, it will probably be the same,” Rao added. But at the same time, performance management is also very critical. 
“So every year, during the performance cycle, we take a hard look at who is performing and who is not. Those who are performing well, we give opportunities to perform better. 
“But sometimes when people don't deliver, then you have to let go. But that is the nature of a high-performance culture. I don’t think there is anything unusual from what we have done in the past,” Pravin Rao added."

The top management of Infosys on Wednesday said all the allegations against the company are false, and that it feels “insulted with the (whistleblower group’s) accusations”.
Nandan Nilekani, the IT major’s Non-Executive Chairman, declared in an investor’s call that even God can’t change the numbers of Infosys. “We have an outstanding finance team. Feeling insulted by the accusations. But let the report come out,” he said. 
CEO Salil Parekh, against whom the whistleblower group has made allegations, said: “I have served with commitment and integrity to deliver a major business transformation in the large, complex organisation. I am grateful and heartened for the personal messages I received from the employees.” 
Nilekani said that contrary to reports, the company had responded responsibly to the complaints, and complied with the applicable laws and past practices. Large margin deals are entirely decided by the management, which is fully within its right to take calls about margins, he added. 
“The company’s deal flows continue to be as large as ever. We are proactively reaching out to customers and are happy that customers are trusting us. Even today morning Salil forwarded me a large deal,” he said. 
He further said all efforts are being made to ensure that the business does not suffer. “We will take necessary steps if the investigation substantiates the whistleblower complaint. Infosys is committed to defining and following the highest corporate governance standards. We will provide a summary of the  ongoing investigation after it is complete,” he said. 
Defending Parekh, he said Infosys on average has grown 11.4 per cent over the last four quarters under his leadership. 
UB Pravin Rao, the company’s COO, said reports of a layoff are mere speculation and that there are no plans for job cuts. “Periodically, we keep a check on involuntary attrition at the mid and senior levels. We have invested a lot in the reskilling and upskilling of our employees. It does not make sense for us to let go of people,” he said."

15,2019-11-17,Infosys,"Weekly Trading Guide
After seeing a flat opening last week, the SBI stock broke out of the range between ₹315 and ₹324. It made an intra-week low of ₹299.7, but bounced up from that level as ₹300 is a strong support. However, the upward movement was capped by a resistance at ₹324 and the stock closed the week at ₹321.9, moving back into the range. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend is at ₹324, making the level a significant one. But the bounce-back looks strong and will most likely lift the price above ₹324 in the coming days. The 21-day moving average continues to remain above the 50-day moving average, maintaining the near-term outlook on the upside. The daily relative strength index, after a blip, is showing an uptick, but the moving average convergence divergence indicator has started to show weakness. If the stock continues to move up, breaking out of ₹324, it can possibly rise to ₹335 in the coming days. However, if the resistance holds and the stock declines, it can be expected to decline to ₹300.





The stock of ITC fell throughout last week and closed with a loss, consecutive in the last five trading sessions. Since the major trend is on the downside, the bears seem to have quickly gained traction on the reversal, negating the breakout of ₹263 in the previous week. At ₹250 level, the stock is hovering around the 50-day moving average. This level coincides with the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bull trend and can thus act as a good support. But the daily relative strength index has dipped below the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has slipped into the negative territory. Both conditions are considered as indicators of bearishness, and the stock will most likely fall in the coming days. On the downside, the stock might find support between ₹247 and ₹250. A break below that level can pull down the price to ₹242 levels. Alternatively, if the stock appreciates from the current level, it will face hurdles at ₹258 and ₹263. The stock declined by 3.8 per cent last week.





The recovery in Infosys stock looks to have taken a pause as it appears to have entered a consolidation phase. The price has been oscillating between ₹690 and ₹725 for the past two weeks. Until the stock continues to trade above ₹690, it is highly likely that it will resume the uptrend in coming days. However, a prolonged sideways movement can be risky, leading to a decline. The daily relative strength index, like the price action, seems to have become flat, whereas the moving average convergence divergence indicator is still in the positive region, indicating strength. In a scenario where the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range at ₹725, it will most likely appreciate to ₹760. This is a critical level as the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bear trend coincides with the 50-day moving average. Beyond that level, the stock has the potential to advance to ₹800 over the medium term. However, if it starts to move southwards and breaches the lower boundary of the range at ₹690, it could depreciate to ₹665, below which the support is at ₹620.





The stock of Reliance Industries gained in the latter part of last week after gradually declining during the week prior. This hints that the bullish trend might have resumed after the minor correction. On pullback, the price marked an intra-week low of ₹1,422.5, coinciding with the 21-day moving average. It then bounced from that level and ended the week at ₹1,470.8, retaining the bullish outlook. But looking at the oscillators, we can observe some weakness in the stock. The daily relative strength index is showing a down-tick following a bearish divergence; also, the moving average convergence divergence indicator has moved into the negative territory. Both indicators hint a potential trend-reversal. On the back of these factors, if the stock declines from the current level, it will find support at ₹1,430. A close below that level would result in a fresh low, taking the price to ₹1,400. However, if the stock gains bullish momentum and continues to advance, it will retest the lifetime high at ₹1,489.65. Resistance above that level is at ₹1,528.





The stock of Tata Steel was sluggish last week, and is hovering around the support at ₹395. Since it has extended the consolidation from the previous week, the recovery in the stock seems to be losing steam. The support at ₹380, coincided by the 21-day moving average, holds the key for the medium-term trend. So, as long as it trades above that level, the stock will have a bullish bias. But a break below that level could shift the trend to bearish. Since the overall trend is on the downside, this might result in a sharp depreciation. The daily relative strength index along with the moving average convergence divergence is showing a downward bias as it entered the negative territory. So, if the price weakens from the current level, the stock might slip towards the support at ₹380 in the near term, below which the support is at ₹360. On the other hand, if the stock starts moving on the upside, it will immediately face a resistance at ₹400. Above that level, the hurdle lies at ₹418 — the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend."

13,2019-11-24,Infosys,"The outlook for Indian IT companies
For the past few quarters, some of the large- and mid-tier IT services companies have been growing at a fair clip and bagging large deals. Digital deals have started to form a larger part of their revenues while core services for most large- and mid-sized players have seen tepid growth; most of the information-technology services companies’ revenue growth was supported by digital.
But the global economic slowdown and the US-China trade war have had a direct impact on many Indian IT services companies. Except for HCL Technologies, which has increased its revenue guidance (Infosys upped the lower-end of its revenue guidance), most Indian IT services companies have cut their FY20 guidances.
With the first half of FY2019-20 behind us and the global headwinds beginning to hit, let’s take a look at the IT services companies investors can bet on. But before we do that, it’s important to look at the levers pulling these companies in different directions.
One segment where client spends are slowing for almost all IT services providers is banking and financial services. Clients are delaying operationalising some deals that were signed in previous quarters. This is especially true of large banking deals in Europe and capital markets- related projects in the US.
While this slowdown might be transient in nature, it allows investors to take a peek at what the clients are thinking about the future prospects of the economy, and as an extension, its impact on IT services companies. Some mid-tier companies that have been growing at a faster pace than their larger peers, have been impacted by large clients delaying spends to achieve cost savings.
With respect to specific verticals, Infosys, TCS and Wipro saw weakness in client spends in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) which led to slower revenue growth in the quarter ended September 30. In the US, capital- market clients, in particular, are putting the brakes on the spends. But digital projects seem to be providing some succour to most players in this vertical.
Another vertical where revenue slowed in the quarter ended September 30 was manufacturing. The revenue growth of Tech Mahindra, Wipro and HCL Technologies slowed in this segment. Retail clients, such as large-format department stores, of the two largest IT services companies — Infosys and TCS — are holding back their spending, which has led revenues to slow sequentially in the September quarter.
Among the mid-sized IT companies, L&T Infotech has seen its banking and financial services vertical’s revenues slowing for the past three quarters. The segment makes up for nearly 27 per cent of the firm’s total revenues.
The company’s group peer L&T Technology Services’ revenues from the telecom and hi-tech verticals have been slowing for three consecutive quarters (its makes up for over 20 per cent of the firm’s revenues).
The retail, consumer packaged goods and manufacturing verticals of Mindtree, which is also part of the L&T Group now, posted a tepid growth for three consecutive quarters.
In terms of geographies, except for Infosys and HCL Technologies, growth in revenues from Europe seems to have slowed in the past few quarters for the large Indian IT players. The macro challenges in continental Europe — with its largest economy Germany slowing — have taken a toll. While TCS’ revenues from Europe have slowed, it’s tepid growth in North American revenues seems to have surprised investors — revenues from North America grew a mere 0.6 per cent during the September quarter to around $2.8 billion.
Wipro’s European revenues have been hemmed in for the past four consecutive quarters mainly because large banks have been delaying spends due to the uncertain economic environment. Revenue growth from Europe during the quarter was muted. However, the company’s North America revenues bounced back after a tepid June quarter.
Muted growth in its manufacturing vertical impacted Tech Mahindra’s Europe revenues. This in turn was impacted by the macro headwinds being faced in Europe, as the EU economy is slowing down in face of the US-China trade war. The firm’s European revenue growth also took a hit because of cross- currency headwinds.
However, after a couple of quarters of tepid growth, Americas helped Tech Mahindra grow in the September quarter — revenue from Americas grew 5.2 per cent to $ 624 million.
Infosys’ European revenues grew, helped by its acquisition of Stater (mortgage services provider) earlier this year, while HCL Technologies’ growth was helped in part by its acquisition of IBM suite of products, which it completed in the quarter ended September. HCL Technologies’ North America revenues were flat in the September quarter, growing just 0.1 per cent sequentially to $1.6 billion. Infosys posted a decent sequential revenue growth of 2.2 per cent in its North America revenues.




 
On the margin front, the September quarter was always going to be a tough one for IT players with pay hikes being doled out to employees. However, among the top IT companies, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra managed to increase their margins sequentially. A rise in sub-contracting costs for TCS led to margins falling quarter-on- quarter.
In the mid-sized IT space, Mindtree and Mphasis managed to better their September quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins compared with the June quarter. Hexaware Technologies, L&T twins (Infotech and Technology Services), among others, saw their margins shrink during the quarter. Most of these companies reported a fall in margins on a year-on-year basis due to a mix of rising sub-contracting costs and adoption of new lease accounting standards that led to higher amortisation expenses being recognised on the books.




 
Also, pay hikes doled out during the first half of 2019-20 impacted margins on a y-o-y basis. Both large- and mid-sized companies have hired a large number of freshers for future projects. Till the projects come on stream and the newly hired are aligned to those projects, there could be an impact on margins due to lower employee utilisation.
There have been news reports that many IT companies, including Infosys, are looking to cut the flab in their mid-level employee hierarchy. If so, it could help improve margins. The point to note here is that the quarter ending December usually sees many employees in the US take off on furlough, which could also shrink margins a bit (this has an impact on revenue as well).
Infosys’ attrition levels have been above 20 per cent for three consecutive quarters now. In the quarter ended June (seasonally higher attrition), the number had spiked to 23.4 per cent. The management has assured that it would try to curb the runaway attrition rate of employees.
Higher attrition pulls down margins as companies have to hire from outside the company to meet short-term demands for talent. This also leads to an increase in sub-contracting costs. TCS’ attrition is one of the lowest in the industry and has been hovering at 11.2-11.6 per cent over the past four quarters. The company is training its employees in digital technologies and has been busy hiring people to meet its future needs when projects come on stream.





Wipro has managed to bring down its attrition to 17 per cent, from nearly 17.9 per cent in the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Tech Mahindra’s attrition has stayed constant at 21 per cent for four consecutive quarters — it’s one of the highest in the industry, just below Infosys. The company’s sub-contracting costs have been rising for five consecutive quarters — it rose 12.2 per cent sequentially in September.
Among the mid-sized IT companies, the hostile takeover of Mindtree by Larsen and Toubro caused disruption and saw many senior employees leave. This can be seen in the steady rise of Mindtree’s attrition rate, from 13 per cent in September 2018 to 16.5 per cent in September 2019. The hope is that now with the takeover complete, the management would tackle this spike in attrition as it could impact margins going forward.
Hexaware has managed to bring down its attrition rate to 17.3 per cent. It had been hovering at 18.2 per cent for the past two quarters. L&T Infotech has seen its attrition spike in the September 2019 quarter to a 12-quarter high of 18.4 per cent, while its group peer L&T Technology Services has seen its September quarter attrition come in at a seven-quarter low of 13.4 per cent.
The deal pipeline of most IT companies does reduce some of the pessimism about their prospects. But most of the pessimism has already been built into the stock prices.
Of the large IT companies that declared the value of deals signed in the September quarter, TCS bagged $6.4 billion, Infosys $2.8 billion and Tech Mahindra its highest ever quarterly deals of $490 million.
Among the mid-sized firms that declared the value of the deals they bagged in the September quarter, L&T Infotech won deals worth $ 100 million, Mindtree $307 million and Hexaware won net-new deals of $36 million (excluding renewals). The point to note here is that these deals — many of which relate to digital transformation — are a necessity. The clients might postpone the spends in face of uncertainty and macro headwinds, but these deals are eventually essential to the clients’ businesses as they will improve efficiency of operations. As an when the deals ramp up, there will be an increase in revenue visibility.
 
The BSE IT index has had its ups and downs over the past 12 months despite rising 10.6 per cent over the period. Compared with their respective three-year trailing price-to-earnings (PE) multiples, HCL Technologies, Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra and L&T Infotech are all trading at a higher 12-month trailing PE multiple. But Wipro, Mindtree, L&T Technology Services, Hexaware Technologies and Mphasis’ 12-month trailing PE are below their three-year average PE.
While picking stocks to invest in the IT sector, it is important to note the cash flow conversion of the companies and the amount of cash these companies return to investors. A high dividend- yielding company, such as TCS, despite being more expensive than its peers, is any day better than one that has lower conversion of profits into cash.
That’s one of the reasons why TCS trades at such a premium to rest of the pack. HCL Technologies, despite its double-digit revenue growth, is valued at a discount to TCS. One of the reasons is the lower conversion of profits to operational cash flow.
TCS’ diverse capability to implement projects in various domains also helps it stand out, but its revenue growth expectations have come a cropper in 2019-20 due to a tepid first half. However, even though we don’t have a call on TCS, it’s still a good bet for investors because of its high payout ratio (80-100 per cent of free cashflows.) This is what keeps its price elevated compared with its peers.
HCL Technologies is also a good pick because it has managed to organically grow in double digits even with macro headwinds, and has upgraded its revenue guidance after the first half of 2019-20. Investors can consider buying TCS and HCL Technologies in the large-cap space and L&T Infotech and Mphasis in the mid-cap space."

 IT services major Infosys on Friday said it has inked an agreement with Australian federal government’s Services Australia to transform the entitlement calculation engine for the nation’s welfare system.
The project will enable Services Australia to quickly implement policy changes for the benefit of Australians without disrupting services and deliver operational cost savings, a statement said.
The Welfare Payment Infrastructure Transformation (WPIT) programme will replace a significant portion of Centrelink’s 30-year-old platform, modernising the way Services Australia calculates entitlements for Australians needing government support, it added.
No financial details of the partnership were disclosed.
Infosys said it was selected by Services Australia following a comprehensive Competitive Dialogue phase which demonstrated a rigorous risk-mitigation strategy to deliver the innovative new solution.
The phase I agreement is for Infosys to create a proof of design and is expected to be completed by mid-2020.
Subject to further approval, Phase II of the project will encompass the build, implementation, and support for the new ECE, the statement said.
The Infosys Australia technical team will service the project, led by its expanding Canberra office.
“With the technology and technical skills of our 5,500 strong team here in Australia, as well as the unique global expertise from similar projects which we can draw upon, Infosys is well placed to add value to Services Australia and enhance the outcomes of the project for all Australians,” Infosys Senior Vice President and Region Head Australia and New Zealand Andrew Groth said."

7,2019-12-15,Infosys,"Weekly trading guide: ITC rebounds from a crucial support 
The uptrend in the SBI stock since the beginning of October witnessed a correction after it registered a four-month high of ₹351 in late November. The correction resulted in the price dropping to ₹308, where the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the prior bull trend lies. The stock took that level as a support and bounced sharply the past week. Also, the daily relative strength index is showing an uptick, and it has crossed above the midpoint level of 50. Thus, the bull trend seems to have resumed and the outlook is positive for the script. However, one needs to be watchful of the resistance in the band between ₹332 and ₹335. From a trading perspective, rather than creating fresh long positions at the current level, one can buy the stock after it closes above ₹335 on a daily basis or if it moderates to ₹325. The initial stop-loss can be placed at ₹315; start shifting it upward with a gap of 1.5 times the ATR (average true range) as the stock advances. The key resistances on the upside are at ₹350 and ₹362.





The stock of ITC has been on a decline since the beginning of November. The decline was stopped at the support of ₹235. This level has been acting as a strong support since August. The stock recovered and ended the week at ₹241.6, forming a reversal candlestick pattern, ie, a hammer in the weekly chart. However, the stock at the current level is facing a stiff resistance at ₹243. This level also coincides with the 23.6 Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend, making the resistance more significant. Hence, for the stock to perform a sustainable rally, the price should close above ₹243 on a daily basis. So, from the perspective of trading, one can approach the stock in two ways. One, initiate fresh long positions if the stock closes above ₹243 and place the stop-loss at ₹238. Two, buy the stock if it falls to ₹235 as that level is a strong support and the risk-reward ratio is highly favourable for long positions; place the stop-loss at ₹230. The potential short-term targets on the upside are at ₹247.5 and ₹252.





 The stock of Infosys continues to trade along the sideways trend. Since the beginning of November, the stock has been held between two key levels at ₹690 and ₹725. As the consolidation phase has been in place for quite some time, the oscillators, ie, the moving average convergence divergence and the relative strength index in the daily chart, are unable to hint any direction. Moreover, the 21- and the 50-day moving averages have converged to the same price level due to lack of trend. Hence, the next leg of the trend can be confirmed only if the stock gets out of this range; traders are advised to stay on the fence until then. If the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range at ₹725, the rally will lead the price towards ₹760. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bear trend coincides with this level, making it a considerable resistance. Any further appreciation will take the stock to ₹800. On the other hand, if the stock breaks below the lower boundary of the range, it could decline to ₹665. Below that level, the support is at ₹620.





 The recent uptrend in the stock of RIL, that began in August, seems to have taken a pause. The price has been consolidating for the past three weeks. However, there are certain indications that the stock might witness a downward movement. The daily relative strength index has formed a bearish divergence, a negative indication; the moving average convergence divergence indicator also exhibits a negative bias. But by observing the price action, we can find that the stock has formed a strong base at ₹1,534, and as long as the price stays above this level, the script can be approached with a bullish inclination. Also, the stock remains above the 21-day moving average, maintaining the short- term positive outlook. Hence, from a trading perspective, one can buy the stock when it retests ₹1,534, and place the stop-loss at ₹1,525. The near-term target can be at ₹1,610. If the stock breaks out the 52-week high at ₹1,614.45, it might appreciate to ₹1,665. Strictly adhere to the stop-loss as a break below ₹1,534 could reverse the trend to bearish.





 The recent bull trend in the stock faced a hurdle, and it pulled back twice in the past one month. But the stock managed to restrict the declines, forming higher lows at ₹383.1 and ₹389. Last week, the stock went up and closed at ₹428.4. It also closed above the 21-day moving average, corroborating the bullish bias. The daily relative strength index is showing an uptick and so is the moving average convergence divergence indicator. All these factors indicate a positive momentum being built up in the stock. However, it faces a resistance at ₹434, where the previous rally was capped. Hence, this is an important level, and a close above it will be necessary to carry over the momentum. Given the scenario, traders are recommended not to initiate fresh short positions as the stock is in a bullish momentum. Wait for the stock to decisively breach ₹434, and initiate long positions with a stop-loss at ₹405 with the potential target at ₹460. As the stock advances, move the stop-loss with a span of 1.5 times the ATR (average true range)."

Infosys, one of India’s top IT majors, has agreed to pay Rs 5.6 crore to settle allegations of misclassification of foreign workers and tax fraud, officials announced on Tuesday.
“Infosys will pay California $800,000 (nearly Rs 5.6 crore) to resolve allegations that between 2006 and 2017, approximately 500 Infosys employees were working in the State on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas rather than H-1B visas,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said.
This misclassification resulted in Infosys avoiding California payroll taxes such as the unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and employment training taxes.
H-1B visas also require employers to pay workers at the local prevailing wage, an official statement said.
“Today’s settlement shows that attempting to evade California law doesn’t pay. Infosys brought in workers on the wrong visas in order to underpay them and avoid paying taxes. With this settlement, California has been made whole,” Becca said.
In the settlement, Infosys, however, denied the allegations and asserted of no wrongdoings.
In 2017, Infosys had agreed to pay the State of New York $1 million to settle allegations of submitting wrong documents to federal authorities.
The Californian settlement that was carried out in November was released to the media on Tuesday.
California initiated legal actions against Infosys after a complaint was filed by whistleblower Jack “Jay” Palmer, a former Infosys employee.
Palmer had sued the Indian company in 2017."

2,2019-12-22,Infosys,"Weekly Trading Guide: Infosys breaks out of the range
The resumption of the bull trend looks evident as SBI closed the week above the resistance band between ₹332 and ₹335. The stock began the week on the back foot, slipping to the support level of ₹325. This support also coincides with the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bull trend. The stock took support at this level and began to rally. The bullish stance is corroborated by key oscillators. The relative strength index in the daily chart shows a fresh uptick following the rally in price. 
 





 
Also, the moving average convergence divergence indicator is on the verge of entering the positive territory. Thus, traders can continue to take a bullish view and initiate long positions on corrections. The initial stop-loss can be placed at ₹320 and subsequently revised upwards by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock moves upward. The immediate resistance is currently at ₹351 currently — its previous high. The subsequent resistance is at ₹362.
The prevailing bear trend, which has been in place since the beginning of November, appears to be limiting the upside in the stock. The stock of ITC gave up its entire intra-week gains. In the past week, after breaking out of the resistance at ₹243, the stock faced resistance at ₹247.5, and started to decline from that level. This level coincides with the 38.2 Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend, making it a significant resistance. 
 





 
However, fresh short positions are not recommended at the current levels even though the stock is trading with a bearish bias, as the risk-reward ratio is not favourable. Importantly, the moving average convergence divergence indicator in the daily chart shows signs of recovery as it has moved into the positive region. Moreover, the price level of ₹235 is a strong support. Hence, unless the stock breaks either ₹235 or ₹247.5, the trend will be unclear. Until then, traders can adopt a range- trading strategy. The resistance above ₹247.5 is at ₹252; the support below ₹235 is at ₹228.
After consolidating since the beginning of November, the stock of Infosys moved out of the range between ₹690 and ₹725. It rallied past the upper boundary of the range at ₹725 and closed the week at 731.5, confirming the breakout. Thus, the medium- term outlook for the stock has become bullish. Adding to the positive bias, the daily relative strength index has formed a new high, following the breakout. Also, the moving average convergence divergence in the daily chart is exhibiting bullish bias. 
 




 
 
The 21- and 50-DMAs are currently at the same level, ie, ₹710, and the stock is trading well above that level — another positive indication. From the perspective of trading, one can initiate fresh long positions on dips with a dynamic stop-loss. While the initial stop- loss can be placed at ₹700, move it upwards by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock advances. The primary target can be at the resistance level of ₹760 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. On further appreciation, the stock can rise to ₹800.
The stock of Reliance Industries (RIL), which has been in an uptrend since August, has been consolidating within a range for the past month. But recently, it bounced from the 21-day moving average and registered a fresh lifetime high of ₹1,617.55. Thus, the bull trend seems to be gaining traction after the pause. But it should be noted that, despite making new highs, the relative strength index (RSI) and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are showing a lack of momentum. In fact, we can spot a bearish divergence in the RSI, hinting at the possibility of a trend- reversal. 
 




 
 
However, the stock has a solid base at ₹1,534, and unless the price breaks below it, the trend-reversal cannot be confirmed. Also, the 21-day moving average is acting as a reasonable support. So, traders can be cautiously bullish and buy the stock on declines. Place a trailing stop-loss at ₹1,550 and raise it by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock appreciates. The short-term targets are at ₹1,665 and ₹1,700.
Extending the bull run, the stock of Tata Steel surged last week. It breached a crucial resistance at ₹434. Thus, it has formed a new peak in the daily chart, denoting a good upward momentum. Substantiating the bullish bias, the moving average convergence divergence indicator in the daily chart continues to advance, implying considerable strength in the uptrend. 
 
 




 
 
However, while the bull trend is backed by several factors, it may not be favourable to buy the stock at the current levels as ₹460 is a crucial resistance. Also, the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level is at ₹470. So, the price band between ₹460 and ₹470 might act as a resistance band, where the stock can witness some profit- booking. From a trading perspective, it can be approached in two ways. Either initiate fresh long positions on a close above ₹470 with the stop-loss at ₹445 or buy the stock if the price moderates to ₹440 with the stop- loss at ₹425. The potential targets on the upside are at ₹495 and ₹515."

Krish Shankar


Krish Shankar

Curiosity and the ability to learn, unlearn and relearn are the two key traits that can get you a job at the country’s second largest IT services firm, Infosys. 
What’s more interesting is that, once in, consistent high performers will be enabled for “career of their choice,” receive bonuses for specialising in skills of the future and increments ranging from 5 to 75 per cent if they make it to the elite Power Programmers team, says a top executive from Infosys.
To keep pace with evolving customer demand for new digital skills, Infosys, which has been grappling with one of the highest employee attrition rates compared to its peers at 21.7 per cent, as of September 30, 2019, is going all out to attract, train, skill, engage and retain talent with a slew of programmes like Be the Navigator, Manager Enablement, Early Career Accelerator Programme (ECAP), Power Programmers and Skill Tags. 
“There are three key elements at the heart of our employee value proposition. Employees who want the opportunity to work on interesting projects and make an impact can be a part of Be the Navigator, a programme that encourages employees who are trained in design thinking to innovate for clients. For example, last year, our team designed a robot to clean electric wires for an electricity company, which wasn’t part of the client brief. 
“Providing employees with a non-stop learning and career development environment through Lex, a mobile-first, modular learning platform that allows our employees to access learning content from anywhere, any device, at any time. 
“And, giving a great digital employee experience, which is facilitated through apps like Infy Me, a personal productivity app,” said Krish Shankar, Executive Vice-President, Group Head-Human Resources at Infosys.
ECAP is designed to cater to early-stage high performers, who are put on the fast career growth track with promotions 18-24 months ahead of the average promotion time-scale. They are enabled for a “career of their choice” with three options to choose from: Rotation to projects where they work on specialised high-end technology and are mentored by the unit technology architect. Digital work, where they are mentored to complete all training and certifications on digital technologies closest to their current skills and moved to these areas within 60 days. And, career shift to consulting/Power Programmer which comes with a compensation hike.
Of Infosys’ 2.28 lakh plus employees, 1.8 lakh are in technology, of whom around 25,000 are middle-level managers. “This year, we have given out a lot of stocks to 8,600 of our middle-level managers. While these are small numbers, we want to ensure that a large number of our managers are involved in the value creation process for our clients,” said Shankar. 
The company has identified 36 new key digital skills for the future and created learning pathways for them, where employees can learn, get certified and work in that area for six months to get a skill tag like Cloud Architect, Scrum Master, or IoT/AI/Big Data professional. 
“Those with skill tags receive a bonus once a quarter in addition to their salaries. We also have a very rigorous - Power Programmer initiative we started two years ago with a small number which has grown to 700 power programmers to date. 
“Our clients said, ‘let’s have nerd programmers and great developers’. So we went out and hired engineers from premier IT schools like IITs and NITs with a passion for deep programming who were selected based on coding challenges like hackathons” said Shankar. 
Existing employees can also apply for the programme. While freshers who get ₹3-3.5 lakh per annum get double the salary, others will get increments ranging from 5 to 75 per cent, based on their capabilities and salary band."
0,2019-12-30,Infosys,"Infy probe report soon, new info on Coffee Day’s Siddhartha likely 

 Two major probe reports which have the possibility of shaking up the corporate world are expected to come out this January. 
While the one which was necessitated by the allegations of a whistleblower group against the Infosys CEO and the CFO is likely to come out first, the report on the mysterious death of Coffee Day Enterprises (CDE) founder, VG Siddhartha, may be delayed as the deal involving the sale of the group’s tech park, Global Village Tech Park, has not been completed.
 
CDE sources told BusinessLine that the deal to sell Global Village Tech park to Blackstone and real estate major Salarpuria Sattva has not reached fruition yet. 
 Though the ₹2,800-crore deal was signed in September, it has hit a roadblock since YES Bank, one of the lenders of the group, insisted on settlement of its dues first. 
 Discussions with the bank is still under way and the deal is expected to be wrapped up soon. Sources also said that the probe report could throw up some new revelations relating to Siddhartha. His body was found on the banks of River Netravati near Mangalore on July 31. 
Later, the CDE board hired former CBI official Ashok Kumar Malhotra to investigate the contents of the letter purportedly written by Siddhartha. New Delhi-based Agstya Legal LLP was also roped in to assist Malhotra in the investigation.
In the case of Infosys, sources said that law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, which was hired by the board to investigate the letters written by two whistleblowers, is expected to come out with its report in early January. There is a possibility that the details of the report might be made public during the announcement of the third-quarter results on January 10. 
A whistleblower group had alleged that Infosys CEO Salil Parekh and its CFO Nilanjan Roy had indulged in “unethical practices,” to boost the short-term revenues and profits. 
The group claimed that it had e-mails and recordings to substantiate its claims. Another letter alleged that Parekh has been violating his employment contract and operating out of Mumbai, and not Bengaluru. 
Defending the CEO and CFO during a recent analyst call, the company’s non-executive chairman and co-founder Nandan Nilekani asserted that the company’s processes were very strong and “not even God could change the reported numbers.”"
