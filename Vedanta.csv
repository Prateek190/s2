51,2018-02-08,Vedanta,"Apex court cancelling Goa iron ore leases to have limited impact on Vedanta 
Shares of Vedanta, one of the largest producers and exporters of low-grade iron ore, did not react much after the Supreme Court cancelled the iron ore mining leases of 88 companies in Goa. 
While the company’s exports may be affected by the decision, the impact on domestic sales will be marginal as much of the iron ore mined from Goa gets exported to China. Profits from the exports are already subdued due to the unfavourable pricing environment.
The Supreme Court in 2014 lifted the ban on iron ore mining in Goa but capped production at 20 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). 
In 2015, the Goa government gave clearance for second renewal of iron ore mining leases to 88 companies. 
On Wednesday, the Supreme Court quashed the renewals given in 2015, stating that the State governments could only give fresh leases and not second renewals. However, it provided a reprieve for the companies by directing them to stop mining operations only after March 15 this year until fresh mining leases (not fresh renewals or other renewals) and fresh environmental clearances are granted.
Out of the 20 mtpa mining capacity in Goa, Vedanta operates 5.5 mtpa. In addition, 3 mt was allocated by the Goa government in the current financial year, there is some uncertainty regarding mine lease renewals for these mines. Apart from this, the company has 2.3 mtpa production capacity in Karnataka.
A significant portion of iron ore from the mines in Goa is exported due to the low proportion of iron content. Not surprisingly, in FY 2017, 65 per cent of Vedanta’s iron ore production, comprising low grade ore from Goa, was exported, notably to China. 
The mineral has contributed nearly 6 per cent to the consolidated operating profit of the company with margins at 31.6 per cent for the same period.
High quality ore
In the recent, third quarter of FY 2018, iron ore contributed up to 3 per cent to the operating profits. 
This amounts to ₹231 crore, or just half the contribution a year ago. This could be attributed to the lower production and sales volumes in the quarter due to lower margins in the export market, which is shifting to the usage of high quality iron ore. 
To overcome this impact, Vedanta has commenced production of high quality ore through beneficiation and blending, which will result in improved realisations and margins.
On account of extended monsoons and the lower pricing environment, the company’s production and sales volumes of ore were lower in the third quarter ending December 2017 compared to the same quarter the previous year. 
For the nine-month period, the company recorded sales and production of 3 mt and 3.4 mt from Goa.
 The company had planned 5.5 mtpa for FY 2018 from the Goa mines. But this now under a cloud. The companies are allowed to mine till March 15, after which they ought to cease operations. As the apex court has directed, companies can resume operations if fresh environmental clearances are given.
‘All options on table’
PTI adds:Talking to the media in Panaji, Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar said his government will explore all options, including auction of mining leases, to ensure that the industry is not affected by the Supreme Court order setting aside the second renewal of 88 iron ore mining leases.
 “All possible ways including auction would be explored. I am not ruling out auction, but I am not confirming it (either). There are multiple options at this stage. We need to discuss it properly with relevant people,” said Parrikar.
 The Supreme Court has not prohibited export of ore, he noted.
 “Exports never happens directly from the mining lease. The ore is dumped at the jetty and then transported using a barge. There is no connection between export and extraction,” Parrikar said, adding that the setback caused by the apex court’s order would be temporary."

Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
What are the medium-term prospects for Vedanta and Hindustan Zinc?
Wasudeo Pat
Vedanta (₹303.5): The stock of Vedanta has been in a long-term uptrend since taking support at ₹58 in February 2016. However, it encountered a key long-term resistance in the ₹340 and ₹350 band and is consolidating in a broad range between ₹280 and ₹350. This resistance band capped the stock's rally in late February.
Subsequently, the stock changed direction and began to decline. Last week, it tumbled 6 per cent, breaching the long-term uptrend line as well as an immediate support at ₹320. Moreover, the indicators in the weekly and monthly charts are displaying weakness, backing the stock’s trend reversal. Therefore, investors can consider taking partial profits off the table at this juncture.
A fall below the immediate support level of ₹300 can pull the stock down to the lower boundary of the sideways range at ₹280. Further fall below this base level will mitigate the medium-term uptrend and drag the stock down to ₹250 over the medium term.
That said, the long-term uptrend will remain in place as long as the stock trades above the significant support range of ₹200 and ₹210. Investors with a long-term perspective can stay invested as long as the stock trades above this support zone with a stop-loss at ₹190. If the key support at ₹280 cushions the stock, it can retain the sideways range for some more time. A decisive rally above ₹320 can take the stock higher to test the upper end of the range. But an emphatic breakthrough of ₹350 is needed to strengthen the bullish momentum and take the stock northwards to ₹380 and ₹410 over the long term.
Hindustan Zinc (₹314.1): Since encountering a key barrier at ₹330 in October 2017, the stock of Hindustan Zinc has been in a broad sideways move between ₹285 and ₹330. In late February, the stock tested the upper boundary at ₹330 and recorded a new high at ₹339. But the stock began to decline thereafter, triggered by weakness in the weekly and monthly indicators. It now tests near-term support at ₹310.
A plunge below this base can pull the stock down to ₹300 and then to ₹285 in the short to medium term. Further slump below the lower boundary at ₹285 will alter the sideways movement and drag the stock down to ₹270 and ₹260 over the medium term.
A break below ₹260 will strengthen the downtrend and pull the stock down to ₹240 and 230. The long-term uptrend will remain in place as long as the stock trades above a key support level of ₹210. Investors can hold the stock with a stop-loss at ₹200. A conclusive rally above ₹330 can take the stock higher to ₹350 and ₹370.
What are the prospects for Vascon Engineers?
P k Mahapatra
Vascon Engineers (₹34.4): The stock of Vascon Engineers met with key resistance at ₹52 in late December 2017 and started to decline. Since then, it has been in a medium-term downtrend. Short-term trend is also down. Last week, the stock tumbled 8 per cent, breaching a key support at ₹37.
Nevertheless, it has an immediate support at ₹32, which can provide some cushion in the near term. An upward reversal can keep the stock in the wide range between ₹32 and ₹40 for a while. That said, if the stock plunges below ₹32, the downtrend will strengthen and pull the stock lower to ₹30 and then to ₹26 in the medium term. Key resistances above ₹40 are at ₹45 and ₹50. Avoid taking positions in this stock.

Vedanta’s copper smelting unit in Tuticorin will be shut for 15 days as part of a routine maintenance, according to information provided by the company to the BSE.
A senior company official told BusinessLine the four-lakh-tonne a year smelting unit is being shut to replace the refractory brick lining in the smelter, an exercise that is carried out every four years. The refining and copper rod production will continue.
Meanwhile, the ₹2,500-crore expansion project at the unit to double the capacity is on schedule, the official said. 
L&T has been awarded the EPC contract and is setting up the entire expanded facility, the official said. When completed in about a year’s time the annual capacity of the plant will go to 8 lakh tonnes of copper cathode, which is refined copper of 99.95 per cent purity.
For now, from the refined copper the unit makes about 2.5 lakh tonnes of copper rods for the domestic market and about 1.5 lakh tonnes of plates for domestic and export markets.
The raw material, copper concentrate is imported through the Tuticorin Port. 
In addition, the by products are about 10 lakh tonnes of sulphuric acid and nearly half this is used to make about 2 lakh tonnes of phosphoric acid. These are used by domestic industries, including chemicals and fertiliser units. With the expansion, the output of these acids will also go up. 
Protests in Tuticorin
On the protests in Tuticorin town against the expansion project, the company has launched an awareness campaign on the environment safety that is being addressed. All norms are being complied with and the project has been taken up with proper statutory clearances.
Officials said the unit is a zero liquid discharge unit that completely recycles the water. Even for the expansion facility, a 12 mld desalination plant will be set up and in addition, primary treated sewage water from Turicorin municipality will be bought and recycled at the company’s sewage treatment plant for water. Emission is continuously monitored online, live by pollution control agencies to ensure that all norms are followed, the official said.

Vedanta has accepted the terms of the LoI. The closure of the transaction will be subject to compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements and according to the final terms approved by the National Company Law Tribunal, Vedanta said in a statement on Saturday.
Vedanta has offered to pay a little over ₹5,000 crore for the distressed asset out on the block to recover ₹11,000 crore it had defaulted to lenders.
The highest bidder was selected by the committee of creditors through a scoring system combining various parameters.
Renaissance files suit
Tata Steel, Vedanta and Abhishek Dalmia-led Renaissance Steel India were the only contenders for Electrosteel. Renaissance Steel had filed two separate petitions in the Kolkata Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal claiming that Vedanta and Tata Steel are ineligible to bid under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. However, this petition was rejected by NCLT. Possibility of Renaissance moving the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal is not ruled out.
Renaissance has claimed that Vedanta and Tata Steel have been found guilty of criminal offences that are punishable with two or more years in jail.
Under Section 29A of the IBC, companies or individuals convicted of such offences are barred from bidding for stressed assets.
Renaissance claimed that Tata Steel UK, a unit of the Indian steel-maker, had pleaded guilty of violating the UK Health and Safety at Work Act. The UK subsidiary faced multiple probes and was convicted each time. Though the offences were punishable with two years in jail, the UK authorities chose to impose fines, it claimed.
Similarly, it said Vedanta Resources Plc, holding company of Vedanta, had violated pollution norms in Zambia. Vedanta Resources-controlled Konkola Copper Mines had, in 2010, pleaded guilty to four charges brought against it by the Zambian authorities for violation of pollution norms.

PK MUKHERJEE, former Managing Director, of Sesa Goa
   -  N Rav Kumar




PK MUKHERJEE, former Managing Director, of Sesa Goa
   -  N Rav Kumar


The Indian iron-ore industry has always been in the limelight with frequent regulatory changes and additions of restrictions. To understand the current industry situation and the impact of the recent Supreme Court judgement quashing 88 mining leases in Goa, BusinessLinespoke to P K Mukherjee, Chairman of Mining and Mining Infrastructure Committee of Goa Chamber of Commerce, former and Managing Director of erstwhile Sesa Goa (now Vedanta). He has almost three decades of experience in the iron-ore industry. Excerpts:
How is the demand for iron ore?
As long as the demand for steel exists, demand for iron ore prevails (iron ore being the key raw material). And the steel sector is growing at a good pace with increasing global demand. The Indian steel industry has huge growth potential — that is evident in its poor per-capita consumption of steel of about 60 kg, compared with an average global per-capita consumption of 200 kg.
The capital-intensive steel companies cannot operate at lower capacities just because of the non-availability of iron ore. It will be imported, if not obtained domestically. I will say that the demand for iron ore in the next two-three years is cautiously optimistic and will be in line with the demand for steel.
How is it on the supply side?
Approximately 80 per cent of the world’s iron-ore trade is done by just four companies (in South America and Australia), and they mostly control the global supply situations. However, iron ore has always been abundant in supply. Indian steel-makers’ requirement is mostly fulfilled by domestic supply. 
They are also privileged to consume high-grade iron ore, thanks to the rich quality of ores available in Indian mines. However, India also imports iron ore to a marginal extent. 
A few steel-makers that do not own any captive iron-ore mines, either purchase domestically or import, based on the costs prevailing in the market.
Will iron-ore prices fall as anticipated?
There are forecasts that prices will fall this year. But I belong to another school of thought that believes prices will stabilise due to the strong fundamentals. As far as my experience goes, iron-ore prices are mostly range-bound in the medium term, and any price movement will not be drastic. 
While it’s true that prices are unlikely to reach the level of 2008-2011, in my view, prices should stabilise at $60-70 per tonne CFR China (for reference grade of 62 per cent Fe fines with Alumina less than 3 per cent and Silica 4-5 per cent).
Your views on Indian steel companies’ complaint on NMDC increasing its iron-ore prices...
We cannot expect the steel industry to respond otherwise.
Iron-ore prices by NMDC (public sector miner) are always lower than the landed cost of imported ore of similar grade and the prices offered by private players. 
NMDC is blessed with best-quality ore from Bailadila (Chhattisgarh) and Donimalai (Karnataka) mines. Comparison of ore prices from these mines with others in India would an apple and orange comparison. I also believe that NMDC provides iron ore at subsidised prices in India, compared with the prices at which they are exported. 
What will be the impact of the Supreme Court’s order cancelling 88 renewed mining leases in Goa?
The Supreme Court quashed the renewals given in 2015, stating that State governments can give only fresh leases and not renewals. Every mining company in Goa has generally three or more mining leases, and the whole production capacity has been limited to 20 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) as per an earlier Supreme Court judgement in 2014. 
A significant portion of iron ore from these mines in Goa is exported as they are considered to be of inferior grades and not used by domestic steel companies. Therefore, the export market of the companies operating in Goa gets impacted. But there will not be much impact on the bottom-line of the companies as they hardly make any profit on their exports at current prices.
The economy of Goa, which is mainly dependent on the mining industry, will be hit. Nearly 40 per cent of the revenue from the sale of iron ore is transferred to the government in the form of royalty, district mineral fund, exploration cess, Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund and other levies. The balance 60 per cent is spent on production and transportation cost locally, which has a direct impact on the State economy.
To put it in numbers, if the revenue from a tonne of iron is, say, $25 FoB (Freight on Board) (after ocean freight, discounts for low Fe, with high alumina and silica and high moisture), the amount that would have been transferred to Goa government directly is $10 per tonne (40 per cent of $25). 
Now, as the mines will be inoperative, the local government would lose nearly $200 million ($10 x 20 mtpa) per annum.
In the same example, the cost of production is $15 per tonne (60 per cent of $25). If I use the multiplier effect at a multiple of 10, the economy would be suffering to the tune of $3,000 million per annum ($15 x 20mtpa x10) or about ₹20,000 crore. 
One can imagine the enormity of the economic impact on a small State like Goa with a population of about 15 lakh due to the sudden stop of the decades-old mining industry.
As directed by the apex court, the companies can resume operations if they receive fresh environmental clearances. How long will that take?
Mining is a highly regulated industry in India. If regulatory agencies work with extreme urgency and everything goes well, it would a take minimum of two years. In the normal speed, it can take five years or so.
What policies should be in place to improve the current conditions?
The iron-ore industry is primarily suffering from regulatory issues. All that is expected is maintaining stability and an implementable policy regime. There is no rocket science involved in regulating mining. 
Many advanced countries do mining; why reinvent the wheel? Many a time, there appears to be a contradiction between the intent of the laws and judgements. Who will come forward to invest in a domain that has such complex regulations and dicey implementation?
One needs to remember that every metal can be substituted. Who can guarantee that 50 years down the line steel will still be used? 
Iron ore shouldn’t meet the fate of mica, for which a substitute was found because of its unavailability caused by numerous restrictions and regulations placed on its mining."
41,2018-05-03,Vedanta,"Vedanta hopeful of Barmer asset extension by year-end
Vedanta Ltd is hopeful of getting an extension as the operator for its prolific Barmer asset from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas by the year-end. Arun Kumar, CFO, said: “We have applied for an extension under our existing terms and expect it to come under the automatic route by the end of the year.”
He clarified further that Vedanta is confident of being able to get an extension without having to shed more of its revenues through profit petroleum committed to the government.
Vedanta’s current position contradicts the government’s terms as in March last year, the government had approved a policy to grant an extension for Production Sharing Contract for oil and gas exploration and production. The policy made the provision of an extension subject to a 10 per cent higher revenue commitment to the government through profit petroleum.
Vedanta has reported a ₹4,802-crore bottomline for the fourth quarter of the financial year 2017-2018. This is 81 per cent higher than the ₹2,647-crore net profit reported during the corresponding period of the financial year 2016-2017.
Exceptional gain
Net sales or the total income from operations stood at ₹27,630 crore which was 17 per cent higher than the ₹23,691-crore top line reported in the last quarter of financial year 2016-2017.
 
The better bottomline can be attributed to an exceptional gain of ₹2,869 crore. A company statement said that these exceptional gains were mainly on account of reversal of previously recorded impairment of ₹7,016 crore at the oil and gas business following the progress on the key growth projects which are expected to result in enhanced recovery of resources.
This exceptional gain was partially offset by impairment of iron ore Goa assets of ₹2,329 crore due to suspension of mining operations from March 16, 2018, after a Supreme Court Order dated February 7, 2018, and reclassification of Foreign Currency Translation Reserve relating to subsidiary investment companies under liquidation of ₹1,485 crore, the company statement added.
Commenting on the plans ahead, Kuldip Kaura, CEO, Vedanta, said: “The capital expenditure cycle is currently going on. We aim to double our crude oil production from the 200,000 barrels oil per day to around 350,000 bopd in three years and then take it up to 500,000 bpd. We plan to invest around $2.5-$3 billion and have invested around 50 per cent of it as orders have been placed.”
Regarding gas, Kaura said that the company currently produces 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent gas and aims to double production within the next 18-24 months."

Sterlite plant: People protests in Thoothukudi




Sterlite plant: People protests in Thoothukudi


The death of 10 people as a result of police firing following public protests against Sterlite Copper in Thoothukudi is a clear case of mismanagement by the authorities. The Tamil Nadu government needs to own up responsibility for failing to intervene earlier or come up with a credible solution which could have avoided the bloodshed. Tuesday’s protest was not by a random crowd or a spontaneous flare-up but one that had been brewing for a hundred days. Even in March, thousands of demonstrators had brought to a halt the port city in South Tamil Nadu. The State government and the police, therefore, cannot claim that there had been no warning. On Monday, the Administration had promulgated Section 144 (IPC) in the city to prevent precisely such a gathering. Of course, a section of the mob too, which indulged in stone throwing and arson, is to blame for the situation spiralling out of control. Nevertheless, the lethal firing which followed appears to have been against standard operating protocols and exposes the lack of preparedness and training of the police in crowd management and riot control.
But the antipathy to Sterlite’s existence is neither a one-off event nor a recent development. The company has been in the eye of such storms since it started in 1997. Protesters have time and again accused Sterlite of polluting the environment and threatening their livelihood and health. This unit of Vedanta Resources, a global giant in this business, has studiously protested its innocence in courts including the National Green Tribunal and the Supreme Court. The Tamil Nadu government and the State Pollution Control Board have only been reactive, but have not taken the initiative to address people’s concerns. For instance, in March 2013, the State government had ordered the unit to be shut down after a suspected gas leak. But the National Green Bench allowed the unit to function because the charge could not be proved. The Supreme Court too upheld the Tribunal’s order. The State government has gone on appeal. More recently, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had declined to renew the company’s licence when it had come up for renewal in March 2018 saying that the unit had not complied with environmental guidelines. 
As if by rote, the Tamil Nadu government has announced a one-man inquiry commission to look into the ‘law and order incidents’ and file a report. But that’s not enough. If the company is really a violator, why does the State government not take decisive action? It is entirely up to the State government and the Pollution Control Board authorities to prove or put to rest the charges of environment pollution against the company. Perhaps an independent and credible expert agency has to be brought in to allay the public’s fears. Simply shutting down the unit every time there are protests cannot be a solution. There are livelihoods at stake in the industry too."

Demonstrations against the copper plant, one of India's biggest, has been going on for more than three months, with protesters alleging that it is a major source of pollution and risk to fisheries.
Vedanta Ltd stock was the top percentage loser on the NSE metal index. Rival Hindustan Copper Ltd gained as much as 7.4 per cent to Rs 73.75. 
Vedanta stock had fallen 18.2 per cent this year as of Tuesday's close, compared with the index's 8.8 per cent fall. Vedanta Resources shares fell as much as 2 per cent to 826 pence in early trading in London.
Nine people were killed on Tuesday when police opened fire on protestors at a demonstration at Thoothukudi in southern Tamil Nadu to demand the closure of Vedanta’s Sterlite Copper unit.
Over 20 people, including policemen, were injured in clashes that erupted when over 20,000 people gathered for the 100th day of the protests against the copper smelting unit. People in the villages around the factory accuse the unit of polluting the environment.

The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has ordered Vedanta Group to stop construction of the second unit of Sterlite Copper plant at Thoothukudi.
A division bench of Justice Anitha Sumanth and Justice M Sundar also directed the Centre to hold public hearing before granting environment clearance to the plant within four months from now, on or before September 23, 2018.
The Order was on a PIL filed by R Fatima of Thoothukudi against Sterlite's application for renewal of environmental clearance for proposed second plant that would double its annual copper refining capacity to 800,000 tonnes.
The PIL said that the company obtained environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests for the second copper smelter plant in 2009. This was subsequently renewed in 2015 and 2016 by ‘misrepresenting the project location being within a notified industrial complex.
However, SIPCOT Industrial Estate Phase II in which the proposed copper smelter plant was to be commissioned was yet to obtain environmental clearance from authorities. There was no public hearing before environmental clearance was given, the petition added.
The petition sought an injunction against commissioning of second copper plant and quashing of the environment clearance granted by both the Centre and State as they were against provisions of Environmental Protection Act, 1986.
Today’s order comes a day after nine people were killed and many injured​ ​in the southern port town​ in a clash between policemen and protesters agitating for closure of the Sterlite plant for alleged pollution of the environment."

Apropos the article ‘Royal Challengers of Bengaluru’ (May 25), the author deserve kudos for coming out with such an interesting conversation between ‘Motu and Chotu’. In fact, it speaks volumes about the inside story of our 12 national political ‘gems’ who were seen holding hands in a show of strength on the oath-taking ceremony of HD Kumaraswamy, as 24th CM of Karnataka.
A government by ‘default’ has forcibly been thrust upon the people as neither the Congress nor the JD(S) had the concurrence of the people to form the government in this ‘hush-hush’ manner. In fact, this need-based opportunistic hobnobbing between the Congress and JD(S) has virtually made a mockery of Indian democracy. While both of them appear to have ‘paid back in the same coin’ to the BJP as it had earlier played the similar political cards in Goa and Manipur but the moot question still remains: Can two wrongs ever go on to make one right? No guesses please.
As regards the ‘Big-12’ representing different political ideologies, their latest publicity oriented political melodrama could be more ‘self-assuring’ than ‘worthy’ of posing any real threat to the future prospectus of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party. Moreover, if one looks back in to the ‘golden’ history of our democracy, it may safely be concluded that most of them have time and again proved themselves to be ‘fair-weather friends’ only to ‘migrate’ to some safe haven as per the need of the hour.

Effects of smoking
This is with reference to the news report ‘Smoking hurts legs too’ (May 25). The harmful effects of smoking is really scary and it is distressing to note that our government does not have a strict policy to ban tobacco consumption.
Although measures like banning smoking in public places and increasing taxes on tobacco-related items will have a significant effect on the sale of tobacco items, in my opinion educating people on the harmful effect of tobacco will prevent people from consuming it. The poor can ill-afford the costs of treating tobacco-related ailments. The anti-tobacco movement can be spearheaded with the help of NGOs, film stars, sports persons, etc.

Sterlite protests
The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) ordering the closure and disconnection of power supply to the Vedanta-Sterlite copper factory in Thoothukudi must cheer all those who have vehemently opposed its existence.
The beleaguered unit has been in the news for all the wrong reasons and the ensuing violent protests have left more than a dozen dead, besides, 19 more critical. It is unfortunate that the plant was carrying out activities to resume its production operations though it was barred from doing so. The Tamil Nadu government and the police are equally culpable because they allowed the situation to worsen and then tried to deal with it using extreme measures.

Proposals on IBC
The change proposed by the Union Cabinet to amend the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, to treat home buyers as secured creditors vis-a-vis developers in a liquidation process in line with suggestions made by the Supreme Court in December 2017, is welcome.
At present, when the developer company is declared insolvent, thousands of families who had booked their homes by investing their hard-earned money cannot lay claim to the proceeds of the liquidation and thus ended up both losing their homes and the money they invested.
With the proposed changes in the IBC, buyers can put pressure on builders to deliver homes on time. It would also deters unscrupulous builders from taking buyers for a ride. It is hoped the ordinance aimed at bringing proposed changes in IBC will be made a permanent legislation sooner than later.

35,2018-05-28,Vedanta,"Sterlite plant will be shut permanently: TN Deputy CM
The Tamil Nadu Deputy Chief Minister, O Panneerselvam, has asserted that the government will take resolute steps for the permanent closure of Vedanta group’s copper plant here.
“Today, the main demand of the people is that the copper plant should be permanently closed. In keeping with their demand, it is shut now. I would like to make it clear that the Sterlite plant will be permanently shut,” Panneerselvam said.
The “Amma’s government’’, will do all things necessary to ensure the plant’s closure, he told reporters, after visiting those injured in the violence and police firing on May 22, at a state-run hospital here. “The government will do its duty for permanently closing down the plant,” he said.
The Deputy Chief Minister said even if there were legal challenges in the closure of the plant, it will be faced and the government will take resolute steps to permanently close down the Vedanta group’s copper unit here.
Describing the death of 13 people in the police firing as an “incident of grief which melted the hearts of everyone’’, Panneerselvam expressed his condolences to the kin of the dead and wished the injured a speedy recovery.
Recalling the steps taken by the government for closing down the plant, he said way ago in 2013, the copper plant was shut by late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa. However, Sterlite approached the National Green Tribunal and got orders for resuming operations and the government’s petition opposing this was still pending in the Supreme Court.
Also, the State pollution control board did not renew its consent due to which the plant could not operate. Panneerselvam said he met 47 injured persons and consoled them, and received representations from them which will be fulfilled. He said compensation has already been provided to all the injured.
The visit of the Deputy Chief Minister, who is also the top leader of the ruling AIADMK, comes at a time when the city has just got back on its feet. Large-scale violence on May 22 against the Sterlite copper plant here and police firing led to the death of 12 persons and the next day, one more youth succumbed to injuries sustained in police firing.
Sterlite Copper is a unit of Vedanta Ltd which operates a 400,000-tonne per annum capacity plant here. With the return of normalcy, prohibitory orders were relaxed and the internet services have also been restored fully.
“Peace has returned to Tuticorin and it will continue and the district administration is working towards that,” the Deputy Chief Minister said.
Panneerselvam also visited the district collectorate which had borne the burnt of the violence on May 22 and held discussions with district officials.
Meanwhile, an AIADMK information technology wing functionary C Hari Prabhakaran, who made an abusive tweet against journalists, was expelled from the party.
“Reporters are not allowed to shoot inside the hospital during the DCM visit - street dogs who shouts for biscuits will be tied on the gate rather allowing them inside,” he had said on his Twitter handle. Prabhakaran subsequently deleted the tweet.
The AIADMK release said Hari Prabhakaran, Kanchipuram East District IT Wing Joint Secretary, was removed from all his party posts, including primary membership, for acting against the party principles and for bringing disrepute."

A view of the Sterlite Copper plant in Thoothukudi




A view of the Sterlite Copper plant in Thoothukudi


 Vedanta Ltd said on Wednesday a sulphuric acid leak from a tank at its southern Indian copper smelter was severe and inaction could lead to serious environmental consequences.
The district administration had said on Sunday the leak was minor, and steps were being taken to empty the storage tanks as a safety precaution.
“There is a severe leakage in the pipe flanges and ... the pipe flanges are submerged in the acid pool collected in the dykes around the acid storage tank,” the company said in a petition to the Madras High Court.
Vedanta, the Indian subsidiary of London-listed Vedanta Resources, said it sought a limited reconnection of the electricity supply for maintenance to guard against a potential loss of life and damage to air and ground water. “There is a grave risk and danger as there are other tanks and there are flammable chemicals and materials within the plant area,” it said.
However, the district’s top administrative official Sandeep Nanduri stuck to the earlier view that the leak was minor. “That is their version, and this is ours. However, we are completely evacuating the sulphuric acid from all tanks as a safety precaution,” said Nanduri.
The Tamil Nadu state government ordered a permanent closure of the plant and disconnected the power supply last month following protests that turned violent and culminated in the police opening fire on protesters, killing 13 of them.
The protesters demanded a permanent shut down of the plant, which they said was causing air and water pollution. Locals and activists see the smelter as a risk to fisheries. Vedanta says the protests are based on false notions.
Vedanta also said it was unable to meet government officials because of the tense situation prevailing after the protests.
A senior state minister told Reuters in an interview early this month that there was “no question” of engaging with the company, and the plant will remain shut.
The smelter, which has been shut for about three months, annually produces about a million tonnes of sulphuric acid, a corrosive by-product of copper smelting used as a raw material by the fertiliser industry. It accounted for over a third of India’s refined copper production, and employed over 3,000 people. The company plans to appeal the government's move to shut the plant."
31,2018-06-22,Vedanta,"Thoothukudi again
Thoothukudi’s woes seem never-ending. After the protests, deaths from police firing and closure of Vedanta’s copper smelter that lead to loss of thousands of jobs, now comes news of an acid leak at the plant which, if left unattended, can cause harm to people and the environment. A leak was detected last week in one of the eight tanks of concentrated sulphuric acid left unattended at the plant premises after the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) ordered disconnection of power supply to forcefully shut the plant down following extensive protests last month. In the last one week 900 tonnes of acid has been removed from the plant and there’s more left. But what’s worrying is Vedanta’s claim that it is not just sulphuric acid but also other hazardous chemicals and substances stored in the plant that are at risk, and that without power, the safety systems cannot be operated. The company has moved the Madras High Court seeking provision of minimum manpower and electricity to maintain the factory.
Considering how the plant was abruptly shut down overnight, it is possible that hazardous chemicals and resins used in the smelting process are still lying in the storage tanks. The protocols for plant shutdown are methodical and clearly laid down. The protocol assumes greater importance in the case of continuous process industries such as copper smelting which operate non-stop because at any given point in time there would be semi-finished products and raw materials in the process. Yet, TNPCB’s order did not take into account these aspects driven as it was by the government directive to shut down the plant forthwith. This is a dangerous lapse that could lead to adverse consequences.
The choices before the Tamil Nadu government now are clear — either allow Vedanta to maintain the plant in safe condition by providing the electricity required and permitting it to take the required number of workers inside for the purpose. Or, enforce a proper shut down of the plant by following the correct protocols for mothballing. A proper mothballing of the plant and equipment is in the interests of not just the government but also the company as it will help preserve the assets in working order. Given allegations by Vedanta of sabotage in the leak of sulphuric acid, it is imperative that the authorities also provide adequate security around the plant premises. The last thing that the government now needs is a leak of hazardous substances from the plant causing an environmental disaster not to speak of direct danger to people’s lives. That would be ironic because the plant was shut down precisely to ensure that such an eventuality did not happen."

Shares of Vedanta retreated from 2-1/2 week high on falling metal prices. The stock dropped as much as 4 per cent to Rs 230, the top percentage loser on the bourses.








 
The copper to aluminium producer posted its biggest intraday percentage loss since June 19 after LME copper prices had hit a 7-month low overnight. Aluminium prices had also hit a near-three month low last night.
Technically, Vedanta stock faces resistance at Rs 242 which it failed to break on Monday. The resistance is identified as the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the uptrend from the February 12, 2016 low to the January 29, 2018 high.

 Pending the National Green Tribunal (NGT) decision, Vedanta Ltd is going all out to make sure its copper plant in Toothukudi is reopened. 
It has urged the Environment Ministry to give clearance to the plant, which directly employs around 2,000 people and will create jobs for more if the unit is allowed to be expanded.
On July 18, after the NGT hearing culminated in New Delhi, officials from Vedanta headed to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF-CC) located at Jor Bagh to implore the top bureaucrats to expedite the environmental clearance application for the expansion project. The letter written by P Ramnath, CEO of Sterlite Copper - Vedanta Ltd, to MoEF-CC, was seen by BusinessLine.
Economic impact
The letter states that “support” is sought from the MoEF to help renew the Consent to Operate (CTO) the existing plant in Toothukudi, which is presently shut on Tamil Nadu government orders. 
“Closure of such a large plant under public pressure has impacted more than 20,000 direct and indirect employees along with an economic impact on downstream industries using copper and acid produced at this plant,” Ramnath says in the letter. 
Even as the NGT continues the status quo on the plant’s closure, Ramnath, in the letter, claimed: “We are a fully compliant organisation on all parameters of air and water pollution. The solid waste, too, is disposed off as per Central Pollution Control Board guidelines.”
The Toothukudi plant had been operational for 22 years, with a capacity to produce 4 lakh tonne copper per annum. The plant was in the process of expansion when public resistance peaked, which also led to the police gunning down 13 civilians. 
“The plant is under expansion for additional 4 lakh tonnes per annum with an investment of ₹3,500 crore with a total employment potential of 40,000 including direct and indirect, post expansion,” Ramnath says. 
“Permanent closure of the plant will make India a net importer of copper with a forex outflow of around $1.5 billion per annum.” The letter further alleges that the series of protests since March 24 were organised by “foriegn-funded NGOs,” without mentioning any particular names.
The Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) rejected the renewal of the plant’s CTO licence on April 9 and issued closure orders on May 23, which the State government later endorsed through an order passed on May 28. 
State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (Sipcot) has now cancelled the land allottment and the TNPCB has withdrawn permission for the expansion project. 
In a reply to the Lok Sabha on July 20, Minister of MOEF-CC, Harsh Vardhan, said the MoEF is considering an application filed by the project proponent (Vedanta) on February 14 for prescribing fresh terms of reference for the preparation of an environment impact assessment report for the expansion proposal.
Vedanta is currently waiting for the MoEF-CC to prescribe the fresh terms of reference, after which it will prepare the latest environment impact assessment report."

Anil Agarwal’s family trust has made a firm $1-billion offer to buy 33.47 per cent non-promoter shares of Vedanta Resources in a deal that values the conglomerate at $3.07 billion.




Anil Agarwal’s family trust has made a firm $1-billion offer to buy 33.47 per cent non-promoter shares of Vedanta Resources in a deal that values the conglomerate at $3.07 billion.


Mining mogul Anil Agarwal’s family trust today made a firm $1-billion offer to buy 33.47 per cent non-promoter shares of Vedanta Resources in a deal that values the conglomerate at $3.07 billion.
“Under the terms of the offer, Vedanta shareholders will receive $10.89 per share in cash for each Vedanta share,” the company said in a regulatory filing detailing about the $1-billion offer. In addition, the shareholders will be entitled to receive a dividend of $0.41 per share in respect of the 12 months ended March 31, 2018.
“Taken together, the offer price and the FY2018 dividend in aggregate represent a total value of $11.30 per share, which on the basis of the announcement exchange rate represents an illustrative premium of approximately 32.4 per cent to the closing price of 647 pence per Vedanta share on June 29, 2018,” it said.
Vedanta had on July 2 announced Agarwal’s plans to delist the company. Agarwal’s Volcan Investments, which currently holds 66.53 per cent of Vedanta, made a cash offer for 825 pence a share.
Vedanta, which owns copper, aluminum, iron ore, oil and steel businesses, was the first Indian firm to list on the London Stock Exchange in 2003. It has lately been facing environmental pressure on its operations.
Tuticorin protests
As many as 13 protesters were killed in a police firing at the company’s copper smelter plant in Tamil Nadu last month that led to political opposition to the company in the UK and drop in its share price. There were demands from some quarters that the firm be delisted from the London Stock Exchange.
The protesters were demanding the closure of Vedanta’s copper smelter plant as they saw it as polluting the environment when they were fired upon by the police.
Agarwal, however, has denied any link between the delisting and the protests. There is “no link at all” with the Tuticorin incident, he had told PTI earlier this month. “This is driven by the desire to simplify the corporate structure.’’
In the stock exchange filing today, Agarwal termed the offer as “a natural progression of our journey to simplify the Vedanta Group’s corporate structure.”
‘Simplifying Vedanta’s corporate structure’
Stating that the London listing has served the firm well since 2003, he said given the subsequent growth of underlying businesses and the maturity of the Indian capital markets, a separate London listing is no longer necessary to achieve the Vedanta Group’s strategic objectives.
The company no longer sees the London listing as necessary to access capital and the deal will simplify Vedanta’s corporate structure.
“In taking this important step towards greater group simplification, we wanted to ensure that the independent Vedanta shareholders were provided with the opportunity to exit on attractive terms, and I believe this recommended offer will deliver on that objective,” he added.
Volcan Investments' stake
If Volcan succeeds in increasing its stake to 90 per cent or above, it is likely that Vedanta will be delisted from the London Stock Exchange, making it a private company.
Volcan is a private company with limited public information on its finances. In 2017, it had raised an estimated $4.4-billion debt through the issue of convertible notes to buy 19.35 per cent equity stake in Anglo American plc, pledging 33 per cent of Vedanta shares as security for annual interest payments of $185 million.
In the filing, Vedanta said the cash shareholders will be financed through a $1.1-billion loan from Credit Suisse AG, Singapore Branch, and Standard Chartered.
If his offer goes through, Agarwal will be left with just two Mumbai-listed companies -- Vedanta Ltd, that houses his sprawling copper, silver, lead, iron ore, power, aluminum mining and oil and gas business, and Hindustan Zinc Ltd. Vedanta Ltd also has an ADR listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
Vedanta Resources was listed on the London Stock Exchange in December 2003. It had raised just over 500 million pounds from a sale of shares at 390 pence. Vedanta Resources owns 50.1 per cent of Vedanta and has near 65 per cent holding in Hindustan Zinc. It also owns 79.4 per cent of Konkona Copper Mines in Zambia, Africa.
Volcan is a holding company wholly owned by the Anil Agarwal discretionary trust. Agarwal is also Anglo American’s biggest shareholder with a nearly 20 per cent stake through Volcan."

The market didn’t seem too pleased with the June 2018 quarter performance of mining major Vedanta, with the stock falling about 2 per cent. The performance was a mixed bag with a good show by the aluminium and oil & gas segments offset by lacklustre display by the zinc and copper segments. Despite consolidated sales revenue growing about 15 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) to ₹22,206 crore, profit was almost flat at ₹2,248 crore. This was mainly due to weak volumes in the zinc and copper businesses.
Strong performers
Operating profit in the aluminium segment more than doubled y-o-y to ₹1,259 crore in the June 2018 quarter. This was driven by a strong 38 per cent increase in volumes to 4.65 lakh tonnes; better realisations also helped. The good show was also aided by cost savings of about $50 a tonne due to operational efficiency and reduction in raw material (alumina) prices. The segment contributed about a fifth of the overall operating profit of ₹6,529 crore.
The oil & gas segment also put up a good show aided by higher oil prices and higher volumes, that more than offset the impact due to maintenance shutdown at one of the fields in the Ravva block. The segment’s revenue and operating profit were up 41 and 46 per cent y-o-y, respectively.
Laggards
But Zinc - India, the major contributor to the group’s operating profit was dragged down by lower volumes. The mined metal during the June quarter (2.12 lakh tonnes) was about 17 per cent lower compared with the March quarter and 9 per cent lower y-o-y. This was due to the closure of the open pit mine at Rampura Agucha and the process of complete shift to underground mining during this quarter. The cost of production ex-royalty was also higher due to factors such as lower volumes and maintenance shutdown.
Zinc - International, too, was on the backfoot due to production decline of 25,000 tonnes, mainly on account of a planned maintenance shutdown at Skorpion, Namibia. Volumes should pick up with production from the Gamsberg zinc mines at South Africa which is expected to start from the second quarter of FY19.
The copper business took a knock due to the troubles in Thoothukudi; the segment posted operating loss of ₹87 crore in the June quarter. It usually contributed 4-5 per cent to the group’s operating profit."

 Industry body Non-Ferrous Metal Manufacturers Association (INFMMA) today urged the Centre to take steps for resumption of operations at Sterlite Copper plant in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu.
 In this regard, members INFMMA have also submitted a memorandum with the Mines Ministry and NITI Aayog, the association said in a statement. “We have requested the Mines Ministry and NITI Aayog to restart the copper smelter. Due to the closure of that smelter, we believe that imports of copper would go up,” INFMMA President DK Jain said in the statement.
 There is already shortage of copper in the market and if the stakeholders import it to keep their operations going they will have to buy it at a much higher price, it added.
 The closure of a running unit has affected the medium and small players of the downstream and ancillary industry who use copper as raw material to produce products such as copper alloy sheets, strips, foils, tubes, pipes and rods, INFMMA.
 “We request the government to at least think about us. We are dependent on the smelter for copper to make items which are further used by other industries. Also think about those who are dependent on us for jobs. We are being made to pay the cost,” Naseem Sheikh, another member of the organisation, said.
 Billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta unit is one of the three primary copper producers in the country. It has a market share of 35 per cent.
 The other two are Hindustan Copper Limited and Hindalco Industries Limited.
 The Tamil Nadu government in late May ordered permanent closure of the smelter after 13 people among protesters demanding its shutdown on environmental concerns were killed in police firing.

22,2018-09-16,Vedanta,"Barmer: Govt looks to milk Vedanta for millions more 
Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd may have to fork out a few million dollars more to get an extension as the operator for its most prolific oil and gas producing asset in Barmer, Rajasthan.
The Rajasthan production-sharing contract (PSC) is valid till May 14, 2020. Cairn Oil & Gas, a vertical of Vedanta Ltd, and the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas as well as the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) are currently negotiating the terms of the contract for an extension.
Multiple sources told BusinessLine that during the negotiations, it was felt that the operator will have to fork out the additional amount as part of profit petroleum that it has paid to the government for the previous years. The sources sought to downplay the figures involved, but some of them indicated that it could be more than $10 million.
In fact, the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) had in its 2014 report observed: “Though the PSC stipulated that transportation cost beyond delivery point would be borne by the buyers, the operator incurred $8.87 million towards shipping of crude to Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd and Reliance Industries Ltd beyond (the) designated delivery point (Kandla) and adjusted it from the revenues. This adjustment resulted in short payment of Profit Petroleum to the Government by $1.77 million.”
 
 








 
Meanwhile, DGH sources said that during the meeting and thereafter, the Ministry had highlighted some audit-related discrepancies.
“This calculation by the auditors may prove to be a bonanza for the government,” said an industry tracker.
The government and the operator have had differences over the terms of the contract. While the government wants the fiscal terms to be reworked — to provide for almost 10 per cent higher share of profit petroleum — in order to extend the contract, the company wants it under the existing terms. The dispute reached the Delhi High Court; the Court struck down the Centre’s demand and directed the government to extend it on the terms sought by the operator. The Centre has gone in appeal against the order.
Sources associated with the company said, “It is not a question of payment; all we want is to continue with the work. We have already made investment plans.”
Incidentally, the contractor would not have had any problem in getting a five-year extension, as the Rajasthan block (RJ-ON-90/1) PSC prescribes for an initial extension of five years on a general merit basis. But the company is seeking a 10-year extension.
While the negotiations are still on, the company proposes to go ahead with a planned investment of $2.5 billion in its Barmer asset to enhance production. As it continues to sort out the issues in respect of Barmer, it continues its strike rate in the country’s oil and gas exploration business. On September 13, it notified its block KG-OSN-2009/3 in Krishna Godavari Basin. The company has also bagged 41 of the 55 blocks that were on offer under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy."

A demonstration outside Vedanta’s headquarters in London on Monday, where the company held its AGM




A demonstration outside Vedanta’s headquarters in London on Monday, where the company held its AGM


Protests took place outside the headquarters here of UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and Vedanta Resources , as campaigners decried that “regulatory failure’ had enabled the company to delist from the London stock Exchange on Monday. Vedanta had listed in London in 2003.
The delisting was being carried out as “part of a policy to further limit public scrutiny of its operations,” said a group of around 50 protesters. “Vedanta out of London out, out, out,” and “Anil Agarwal (Vedanta Chairman), blood on your hands!” they shouted.
Last week, campaign group Foil Vedanta, which brings together activists in the UK alongside local campaigners in India and Zambia, published a detailed report describing legal judgments and evidence of “key violations” across India, Zambia and beyond.
The report was intended to “inform governments, parliamentarians regulatory bodies and investors” who were concerned around the company’s behaviour, it said. A copy of the report was handed to an FCA representative on Monday.
“Our report and today’s protests send a clear message that London listing authorities must take serious note of regulatory failures that have been recurring with a disproportionate number of controversial mining companies like Vedanta,” said Samarendra Das of Foil Vedanta and author of the report.
“Instead of taking action following the Tuticorin (Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu) massacre, they are allowing them to jump ship and run away from London to avoid further scrutiny.”
“We are aware that Vedanta’s LSE delisting takes effect from today. We are not aware of any impact that the delisting will have on the litigation in which we represent over 1,800 Zambian villagers in their claims against Vedanta and its subsidiary, KCM, for losses they say they have suffered as a result pollution from the Nchanga copper mine,’ said Oliver Holland, a solicitor at Leigh Day, which is representing the villagers.
“As far as we and our clients are concerned, the case is continuing and the next hearing on jurisdiction is listed to be heard by the Supreme Court on January 15 and 16, 2019.”
As expected, Vedanta Resources announced on Monday that the listing of the company’s shares on the official list of the UK Listings Authority, and trading of all company shares on the London Stock Exchange’s main market, had been cancelled with effect from 8 am today.
In September, Volcan Investment Ltd, the holding company wholly owned by Agarwal’s discretionary trust, said its cash offer for the shares it didn’t already own in Vedanta had become unconditional after minority investors agreed to sell their shares. In July it announced a plan to acquire the remaining 33.47 per cent of Vedanta Resources, valuing the company at £2.325 billion ($3.03 billion). The all-cash offer of £8.25 a share marked a 28 per cent premium on the closing price of Vedanta Resources before the offer was announced.
Agarwal described the move to take the company private as a “natural progression”. While a London listing had served the company “extremely well” since 2003, it was no longer necessary for the company to achieve its strategic objectives, he added.
In recent months, criticism of Vedanta has grown following the killing of protesters in police firing in Thoothukudi in May.
The opposition Labour Party called for Vedanta Resources to be delisted from the LSE to “remove its cloak of respectability.”"

The three-member independent committee formed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has termed the shutdown of Vedanta’s Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, “unsustainable”, and said it it is against the principles of natural justice.
The tribunal was hearing arguments in the ongoing case between Sterlite and the TN government, with the latter keen on the closure of the plant.
In its report, the committee has recommended that Vedanta set waste management rules at the plant and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) monitor compliance with pollution control norms.
The committee, headed by former Meghalaya High Court Chief Justice Tarun Agrawal, said no notice or opportunity of hearing was given to Vedanta before the closure.
It submitted the report following a site visit and public consultations. It had received thousands of letters from pro- and anti-Sterlite groups.
In May, 13 civilians lost their lives after a protest by locals asking for the plant to be shut down turned violent. Vedanta had approached the NGT against the consequent decision of the Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to shut down the plant.
Vedanta now claims the committee report, if implemented, will offer relief to the approximately 25,000 families impacted by the closure.
Reacting to the NGT committee report, P Ramnath, CEO of Sterlite Copper, said Vedanta has always been environmentally conscious in every aspect of operations, and followed all the regulations.
“The NGT committee has taken time to follow due process, independently investigate and hear both sides of the argument. They have finally submitted a report stating that the sudden closure of Sterlite Copper is against natural justice. We have consistently been voicing the fact that Sterlite Copper is not a pollutant and the NGT report also states the same,” he added.
The matter is now listed for consideration with the NGT on December 7."

 Shares of copper and aluminium producer Vedanta Ltd jumped as much as nearly 4 per cent to Rs 200.65 as the three-member independent committee formed by the National Green Tribunal has termed the shutdown of Vedanta’s Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, “unsustainable”, and said it it is against the principles of natural justice.
The Tribunal was hearing arguments in the ongoing case between Sterlite and the TN Government, with the latter keen on the closure of the plant. It said that there were insufficient grounds to permanently close Vedanta's copper smelter and the TN Government’s decision to shut it amounted to administrative overreach.
The panel said authorities in Tamil Nadu, where the plant is located, had failed to comply with the procedures before shutting down the smelter and the company was not given any notice or opportunity to explain its position.
The Tamil Nadu Government had ordered permanent closure of the smelter in May after 13 people protesting to demand its shutdown on environmental concerns were killed in a police firing. Now the environment court will decide on the panel's report on December 7.

The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear on January 8 Tamil Nadu’s appeal against the NGT order to reopen Vedanta Ltd’s Sterlite copper plant at Tuticorin.
A bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice S K Kaul said the case will be heard next week.
Senior advocate C A Sundaram, appearing for Vedanta, said Tamil Nadu has filed an appeal against the NGT order so the case be heard urgently as they are facing problems with storage of sulphuric acid in the plant.
Tamil Nadu had moved the apex court on Wednesday against the NGT verdict that set aside the state government order to close the plant at Tuticorin.
At least 13 people were killed and several injured on May 22 last year when police opened fire on a large crowd of people protesting against environment pollution being allegedly caused by the plant.
The plea, filed through advocate M Yogesh Kanna, had said that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has “erroneously” set aside various orders passed by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) last year with regard to the Sterlite plant.
It had said that the tribunal had consequentially directed the TNPCB to pass fresh orders of renewal of consent and issue authorisation to handle hazardous substances to the Vedanta Limited.
“The final impugned judgment and order dated December 15, 2018 is liable to be set aside by this Court as the Tribunal failed to consider the data, document and evidence furnished by TNPCB to prove that the respondent no.1 (Vedanta) herein had irreversibly polluted the ground water in and around Thoothukudi District,” the petition had said while seeking a stay on the NGT verdict.
It had held that non furnishing of ground water analysis report is a “technical breach and is trivial in nature”, the plea said.
“The said finding of the Tribunal shows non-application of mind as the appellants (TN and others) herein have furnished sufficient evidence to show that the respondent no.1 had polluted the ground water and therefore the respondent herein had not furnished the ground water analysis report,” it had added.
The state government further said that it had raised various contentions before the committee appointed by the NGT but the committee failed to consider those contentions as well as documents while preparing its report.
On December 15, the NGT had set aside the Tamil Nadu government order for closure of the Sterlite copper plant, saying it was “non sustainable” and “unjustified“.
It had asked the TNPCB to pass a fresh order of renewal of consent and authorisation to handle hazardous substances, subject to appropriate conditions for protection of environment in accordance with law within three weeks.
The NGT had allowed the appeal of the company challenging the plant’s closure.
The green panel said the company should spend within three years Rs 100 crore on welfare of inhabitants of the area as it had offered to do.
It also suggested that the company take steps for safeguarding the environment, like creating a dedicated website where the stakeholders can lodge their environment-related grievances.
The Tamil Nadu government had, on May 28, ordered the state pollution control board to seal and “permanently” close the mining group’s copper plant following violent protests over pollution concerns.
In April, the TNPCB had rejected Sterlite’s plea to renew the ‘Consent To Operate’ certification, saying the company had not complied with the stipulated conditions.
The tribunal had earlier set up an independent committee to look into the allegations of environmental pollution by Vedanta-owned Sterlite copper factory.
The committee, headed by former Meghalaya High Court Chief Justice Tarun Agrawal, had said that no notice or opportunity of hearing was given to Vedanta before the closure of the plant.
On August 9, the tribunal had allowed Vedanta to enter the administrative unit inside its Sterlite copper plant at Tuticorin"
15,2019-01-13,Vedanta,"Zambia pollution: UK’s SC to hear case against Vedanta 
Britain’s Supreme Court will decide if over 1,800 Zambian villagers can take Vedanta and its Zambian subsidiary, Konkola Copper Mines, to court in the UK over allegations relating to the pollution of a river there. 
Lower courts previously upheld the jurisdiction of the UK courts in the case, which Vedanta has appealed all the way up to the Supreme Court. The issue will be heard on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a decision potentially expected by April.
The villagers, represented by UK law firm Leigh Day, say that their water sources and farm land have been contaminated by product from KCM’s copper mining operation over the past 15 years, resulting in health problems and harm to crops. Their lawyers are set to argue that the case can be heard in the UK, where Vedanta remains domiciled, because the company should bear equal responsibility for the damage. 
In 2017, the Court of Appeal upheld the 2016 judgement of a lower court, enabling the case to go ahead. The lawyers for the villagers do not believe their case is impacted by the decision of Vedanta Resources to de-list in London last year. “Our clients continue to suffer from the effects of the pollution, both on their health and their livelihoods,” said Oliver Holland of Leigh Day. “The clients first came to us almost four years ago and we are, very unfortunately, still dealing with a preliminary issue, which has prevented our clients’ claims from moving forward. We hope that if the Supreme Court allows the claims to proceed in this jurisdiction, that Vedanta will then come to the table speedily to resolve these claims,” he added.
“Vedanta and KCM believe that the Zambian court system is the natural forum for the hearing of the claims. KCM, the operating company, is domiciled in Zambia, and all of its operations are located in Zambia, and that is where the claimant communities live and the alleged claims arise,” said Vedanta and KCM in a statement ahead of the hearing.
The claims date back to 2004, when Vedanta Resources Holdings Limited, a subsidiary of Vedanta, acquired a 51-per cent stake in KCM, and then gradually increased its stake. 
The villagers allege that both Vedanta and KCM were aware of the discharge of harmful effluent into the waterways, which the villagers used as their primary source of clean water for drinking, bathing, cooking, cleaning, and other purposes, and point to studies — including a 2014 Zambian government report — that noted high levels of toxicity. 
They argue that Vedanta failed in its duty of care, and they are pursuing the case in the UK because of the parent firm’s location here. 
Vedanta and KCM sought to challenge this, insisting the entire focus of the case is on Zambia and ought to be heard there. Arguments also centred on whether the villagers — many with very limited resources, financial and otherwise — would be able to properly pursue the case in Zambia, with the judge in the initial case concluding that if they pursued KCM in Zambia there was a risk they would “not obtain justice.”
Villagers along the River Kafue, as well as Chingola residents, have suffered severe pollution of water resources ever since Vedanta took over the mines. Despite 12 years of legal campaigning in Zambia, nothing has been done to improve the desperate situation for the most affected communities, where the land is poisoned and people are very sick, said Zambian campaigners from Chingola, George Mumbi and Esson Simbeye, ahead of the hearing.
Campaign groups, including Foil Vedanta, are expected to protest outside the hearings. “While the financial and material gains from copper have been allowed to flow seamlessly out of the country, justice risks being restricted by economic and institutional barriers of territoriality,” said Samarendra Das of Foil Vedanta."

The Supreme Court on Monday refused to allow reopening of Vedanta’s Sterlite plant in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district, which was at the centre of massive protests over pollution concerns, but granted the company liberty to approach the high court.
A bench headed by Justice R F Nariman allowed Tamil Nadu’s appeal against the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order only on grounds of maintainability and said the tribunal has no jurisdiction to order reopening of the plant. The court was hearing a plea by Vedanta group seeking a direction to Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to implement the NGT order which had set aside the government’s decision to close the plant.
On January 8, the apex court had paved the way to re-open the plant by refusing to stay the tribunal’s order.
It had also stayed the last year’s December 21 decision of the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court which had ordered status quo with respect to re-opening the plant.

Vedanta shares fell as much as 4.95 per cent to Rs 240.15, their lowest since June 28, 2017.
The downtrend in the stock movement continued as 12 people were killed in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu after police fired at violent protesters calling for closure of a copper smelter run by co's London-listed parent Vedanta Resources.
A court had on Wednesday put a temporary halt to the company’s much-delayed plan to nearly double the capacity at the plant. Demonstrations against the copper plant, one of India's biggest, have been going on for more than three months, with protesters alleging that it is a major source of pollution and risk to fisheries.
Shares of parent Vedanta Resources fell 11.5 per cent on Wednesday, despite reporting full-year profit that beat estimates. In the last two months, analysts have trimmed Vedanta's current fiscal year's profit forecasts by 9.2 per cent, the biggest downgrade among metals and mining companies in India.
Vedanta trades at a 12-month forward PE of 7.05, lowest among metals and mining firms in India; the company’s last five years' average PE is 8.57. Technically, the stock trades near a support at Rs 242, the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the uptrend from the February 12, 2016 low to the January 29, 2018 high.

A view of the Konkola Copper Mines in Zambia. Over 1,800 people from poor farming communities in the region are seeking to bring proceedings against the company alleging toxic emissions into waterways


A group of over 1,800 Zambian citizens can take Vedanta Resources and its Zambian subsidiary Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) to court in the UK over allegations relating to the pollution of a river there, after Britain’s Supreme Court rejected an attempt by the company to challenge the jurisdiction of British courts.
They will now be able to bring their claims for torts of negligence and breach of duty to the courts in the UK, first initiated in 2015.
The Supreme Court judgment is seen as having wider significance for parent companies and their ability to be held liable for alleged activity abroad. Vedanta Resources cannot appeal the jurisdiction judgment any further as its attempt to suggest recourse to the European Court of Justice during the Supreme Court proceedings was also rejected.
The judgment was read in court by Lord Briggs, with the four other justices considering the case concurring with him.
“For the claimants it’s hugely significant. They can proceed with the substantive claim, which was their initial intention, and hopefully obtain some sort of justice for the allegations they have made,” Oliver Holland, from the law firm Leigh Day, who is representing the claimants, told this paper. “We did not envisage that it would take so long to get to this point.”
He added that the judgment had wider significance, too. “What Lord Briggs clarified was the extent to which a parent company is responsible for the actions of a subsidiary. He says, importantly, that where a parent corporate entity in London is saying they take responsibility for the actions of the subsidiary on environmental, health and other issues — whether or not they actually do so — they can be held liable.”
Vedanta Resources and KCM had won the right to appeal to Britain’s top court after lower courts had upheld the jurisdiction of UK courts.
Over 1,800 men and women from poor farming communities in Zambia had sought to bring proceedings against the company alleging toxic emissions from the Nchanga Copper Mine (owned by KCM) into waterways on which they are heavily reliant for drinking and irrigation.
While KCM was the operator of the mine, the claimants argued that Vedanta Resources — because of its high level of control and direction over the mining operations — should also face the allegations, and commenced proceedings in 2015. Attempts by Vedanta and KCM to challenge the jurisdiction were thrown out by the High Court and Court of Appeal in 2016 and 2017. They then sought the Supreme Court’s ruling, alleging an abuse of EU law in the pursuance of the case, that there was no real triable issue against Vedanta, and that the UK wasn’t the right place for the claims to be made.
In their judgment, the Supreme Court justices also said that appellants needed to use “proportionality” and “economy” in pursuing cases around jurisdiction, in an implicit criticism of the determination with which the jurisdictional issue was pursued.
They said that “well-known warnings” — that such cases should not involve “masses of documents” and parties incurring “hundreds of thousands of pounds in costs” — were ignored in this case.
“The parties’ two written cases (ignoring annexes) ran to 294 pages. The electronic bundles included 8,945 pages. No less than 142 authorities were deployed, spread over 13 bundles, in relation to an appeal which, on final analysis, involved only one difficult point of law,” they said. They also suggested there had been an attempt to “dress up” what was in reality a “factual dispute.”
“As the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals recognise, sustainable development and access to justice go hand in hand. The judges’ ruling today recognises and enforces that principle,” said Samarendra Das of Foil Vedanta, a grassroots organisation that has campaigned in London as well as in India, Sri Lanka, Zambia, Liberia and South Africa. “This is an historic day for victims of British multinationals’ abuses worldwide.”
Vedanta Resources was contacted for its comment but has not provided its response at the time of going to print."

 Shares in Vedanta Limited dropped as much as 4.1 per cent to Rs 156.80, their lowest since February 20 and biggest percentage loss in nearly four weeks
The miner's Q4 net profit had dived to Rs 2615 crore, but it had come in much above the expectations, from Rs 4802 crore a year ago. This was due to a one-time gain of Rs 2869 crore it had seen as a reversal of previous impairments.
Capital markets and investment group CLSA cuts PT on stock to Rs 135 from Rs 170 with “sell” rating. They said the concern over the related-party transaction will remain an overhang and is likely to overshadow its underlying earnings outlook. It will also remain a drag on its valuation.
CLSA said that the slow volume ramp-up in zinc & oil and increased costs in unit Hindustan Zinc Limited are concerns.
Morgan Stanley said that the focus remains on volume growth in zinc, aluminium and oil & gas, and better cost management, particularly in the aluminium segment; keeps “equal-weight” rating with PT of Rs 176."

Metal conglomerate, Vedanta’s stock fell by about 3 per cent in today’s trade post its announcement of Q4 results on Tuesday.
In the latest March quarter, the company’s consolidated revenues and operating profits were down 12 per cent each, as compared to a year ago period. This was on account of subdued growth in volumes and realisations in its key segments - Indian operations of zinc, copper and aluminium.
While the impact of rupee depreciation and operational performance of other segments such as oil and gas, steel, international operations of zinc and iron ore were positive, profits continued to be under pressure. The net profit for the quarter fell by 43 per cent to Rs 3,218 crore.
The Indian operations of the zinc (Hindustan Zinc) continued to be under pressure as the metal’s production and sales volumes in the March quarter were down 15 per cent each as compared to the previous year. Transitioning to absolute under-ground mining of the metal in India, led to cost of production shooting up by 17 per cent to Rs 69,600, from Rs 59,600 per tonne a year ago. This was worsened by the lower LME prices of the metal that were hovering at an average of $2,702 per tonne in the quarter, a fall of 21 per cent year-on-year.
All these factors exerted pressure on the profitability of the company’s India zinc operations with operating profit falling 23 per cent to Rs 2,777 crore in the March quarter. Despite lower metal prices, the international operations of the zinc were buoyant with higher sales volumes and drop in cost of production. The cost control measures helped in boosting the operating profits by 51 per cent to Rs 391 crore.
Despite tepid production and sales volumes of oil & gas in the quarter ending March 2019, the revenues from this segment grew 15 per cent to Rs 3,175 crore on account of rupee depreciation and higher realisations. Though the global Brent price per barrel was down by 6 per cent during the quarter, the company managed to improve its average realisations by 5 per cent to $62.1 per barrel. The operating profit for the segment went up by 20 per cent to Rs 1,805 crore, which accounted for about 29 per cent of the consolidated operating profits.
The shutting-down of Tuticorin copper plant in Tamil Nadu led to operating losses of Rs 69 crore for this segment in the March quarter. This compares to profits of about Rs 347 crore during the same period last year."

 India’s steelmakers, more accustomed to securing raw materials such as iron ore and coal, are keeping another key resource in their sights: water.
Two of India’s biggest steelmakers - JSW Steel and Tata Steel - and metal producer Vedanta have flagged risks due to water shortages in the past month as the world’s second-most populous country faces an unprecedented water crisis.
Competition for the resource is set to grow in India, where nearly a third of the country is water-stressed, increasing costs and risks for companies. A delayed monsoon, which accounts for 70 per cent of the nation’s annual rainfall, has exacerbated the situation this year.
The urgency surrounding water supply risks is not lost in our discussions with companies, but the talking is still happening behind closed doors, according to Damandeep Singh, director at CDP, which runs a global disclosure system for companies and others to report environmental risks. The problem is that when companies in India get water, they get it cheap. There’s no incentive to manage a resource when it is available so cheap.
Water is shaping up to be a serious economic risk in Asia’s third-largest economy. Desertification, land degradation and drought cost India about 2.54 per cent of gross domestic product in 2014-15, according to a study last year by Indias environment ministry. In a global survey of miners, just under half the respondents reported financial impact worth $11.8 billion over five years thanks to water-related problems such as droughts, increased water stress and flooding, according to a 2018 report from CDP.
Indias second-biggest steel mill JSW Steel has built a new water reservoir with 1.3 thousand million cubic feet storage capacity at its plant in the water-scarce southern state of Karnataka to ensure adequate supply for uninterrupted operations, the Sajjan Jindal-owned company said in its annual report on July 4.
Top producer Tata Steel is also investing in sewage treatment plants to process water for reuse and creating new rain water harvesting structures to improve the groundwater table. Water is used as a coolant in the steel making process and over 3 cubic meters of freshwater is required per ton of crude steel produced, it said in the annual report last month.
Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta performed a water risk assessment at 25 of its most significant business locations and found that its operations in Rajasthan, Punjab and Tamil Nadu had a greater risk of shortages than elsewhere because of competitive pressures for water usage in those regions, the Mumbai-based company said in its annual report last month.
About 600 million Indians are facing high-to-extreme water stress and the situation is set to worsen as water requirements rise, according to a 2018 report by NITI Aayog, the governments policy making body. Water demand is expected to be twice the available supply by 2030, implying severe water scarcity for hundreds of millions of people and an about 6 per cent loss in India’s gross domestic product, it said.
Greater demand for resources and extraction of mineral reserves in often water-scarce locations, where stable supply of water is no longer guaranteed, continues to jeopardize existing and future operations, according to CDP. Companies including miners have been taking water for granted for the longest period, CDP’s Singh said. They are still taking an ostrich-in-the-sand approach."

 Vedanta, one of South Africa's biggest international investors, will process its zinc ore elsewhere unless the country can fix its power problems, the CEO of Vedanta unit Vedanta Zinc International said.
South Africa has suffered rolling blackouts and the debts of state power company Eskom have sapped the country's economy.
The utility's problems also risk scuppering South Africa's goal of encouraging processing from mining operations to maximise revenues and jobs.
Deshnee Naidoo, the CEO of Vedanta Zinc International (VZI), which has operations in South Africa and Namibia, said she was concerned a solution might not be possible.
“If we can't make it work here, we will have to look at other geographies,” Naidoo said in an interview on the sidelines of the London Mines and Money conference. “My concern is about government's ability to deliver power.”
Just under a year ago, Naidoo said there was excess power capacity to help fuel a boom in the Northern Cape, which she described as one of the world's most exciting zinc districts.
The government is encouraging miners to build their own generation and supply any surplus to the South African grid.
But Naidoo said there was a problem with a lack of regulation for hybrid power, which she said was necessary because energy-intensive miners need fossil fuel to provide baseload and cannot rely solely on wind and solar.
VZI's power needs are mostly for processing ore from its Gamsberg mine, whose capacity it wants to double to 8 million tonnes per year.
One option could be to refine ore from Gamsberg in Namibia, but that would require the processor there to be adapted, Naidoo said.
In Namibia, Vedanta's Skorpion mine will close in 2021 and is on four months of extended maintenance from October following technical problems.
Naidoo said that when output resumed, it would be around 10,000 tonnes a month until September 2021 when the site will be put into extended care and maintenance as the mine will be exhausted.
Zinc, mainly used for galvanising steel, has fallen nearly 7 per cent this year. Vedanta's share price has fallen around 27% as it battled an array of issues.
In Zambia, it has been locked in a dispute with the government since May, when Lusaka appointed a liquidator to run Konkola Copper Mines -- 20 per cent owned by Zambia's state mining company ZCCM-IH and the rest by Vedanta.
Zambia accused KCM of breaching the terms of its licence, an accusation the company has denied."

Investors with a short term perspective can buy the stock of Vedanta at current levels. The 3.5 per cent gain accompanied by above average volume on Tuesday, has taken the stock above a crucial resistance level of ₹150, thus providing traders an opportunity to buy it at current levels.
After a fall from around ₹160 in early November, the stock found support at ₹140 and started to move sideways. This key support cushioned the stock in early December as well as last week. Subsequently, the stock began to trend upwards breaching the 21- and 50-DMAs and trades well above them. The recent close above the immediate resistance level of ₹150 strengthens the up move.
The daily relative strength index is on the brink of entering the bullish zone from the neutral region while the weekly RSI continues to feature in the neutral region. Besides, the daily as well as the weekly price rate of change indicators hover in the positive terrain implying buying interest.
The short-term outlook is bullish for Vedanta. The stock has the potential to trend upwards and reach the price targets of ₹158.5 and ₹161.5 in the upcoming trading sessions. Traders can buy the stock with a stop-loss at ₹149.
