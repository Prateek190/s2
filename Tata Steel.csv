ITC seeks for a direction


ITC is stuck in a narrow range for the third consecutive week. The support at ₹260 and resistance at ₹267 are key levels to watch in the coming days. A breakout on either side of these two levels will decide the next leg of move for the stock and give a cue on the upcoming trend. If the stock sustains above ₹260 and breaks above ₹267 decisively, the downside pressure will ease. Such a break can take it higher to ₹272 and will also give an early indication that the downtrend that has been in place since July 2017 could be ending. A decisive break and close above ₹272 will confirm the trend reversal and can target ₹277 and ₹280 thereafter. But if ITC declines below ₹260, it can dip to test the significant support level of ₹257. A further fall below ₹257 will then increase the possibility of the stock extending its down-move towards ₹252. Traders can hold the long positions and accumulate on dips at ₹257. Retain the stop-loss at ₹254 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹270.


Infosys can dip ahead of results


After a strong rally for four consecutive weeks, Infosys fell sharply last week by 2.6 per cent. Support is at ₹1,010. A break below it will increase the likelihood of the stock extending its current down-move to ₹980 or ₹975 this week, well ahead of the third quarter results announcement on Friday. The outcome of the quarterly results will then determine the next trend for the stock. If Infosys manages to bounce from ₹980-₹975, an upmove to ₹1,010 will be possible. But a fall below ₹975 can drag the stock further lower to ₹950 levels. On the other hand, if the stock sustains above ₹1,010 this week, a bounce to ₹1,035 and ₹1,045 is possible again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹1,010 and ₹1,045 can be seen for some time. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹1,045 is now needed for the stock to gain fresh momentum and rally further. The next target above ₹1,045 is ₹1,070. Investors can hold the long positions and can accumulate if the stock falls towards ₹980 in the coming days.


RIL is stuck in a narrow range


RIL has been stuck in a narrow range over the last couple of weeks. The immediate outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹908 and resistance is at ₹937. A breakout on either side of ₹908 or ₹937 will determine the next trend. Until then the stock can continue to trade sideways between ₹908 and ₹937. A strong break above ₹937 can ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take the stock higher to the crucial resistance level of ₹960. A strong break above ₹960 can boost the momentum and take the stock further higher to ₹1,000 levels thereafter. On the other hand, if RIL declines below ₹937 in the coming days, a fall to ₹895 or ₹890 is possible. A break below ₹890 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹880 or ₹875. As being reiterated over the last few weeks, the region between ₹880 and ₹875 is a crucial support zone. A decisive break below ₹875 will increase the possibility of a double-top reversal pattern on the chart. In such a scenario, the possibility of the stock falling to ₹854 will increase.


Short-term view is bearish for SBI


SBI fell last week as expected to touch a low of ₹301.65. Though it managed to reverse higher from the week’s low, the bounce-back move lacks strength. The stock made a high of ₹311.8 on Friday and came off from there to close 1 per cent lower. The short-term outlook remains bearish. A cluster of resistances in the broad ₹310-₹320 region can cap the upside in the short term. An intermediate bounce to this resistance zone if seen can see fresh sellers coming into the market. A fall to ₹294 or ₹292 is likely in the coming days. A strong break below ₹292 will increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹285. Traders who have taken short positions last week can hold them. Add more short positions at ₹314 if an intermediate bounce breaking above ₹310 is seen in the near term. Retain the stop-loss at ₹317 for the target of ₹294. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹305 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹299. The outlook will turn positive only on a strong break above ₹320. But such a strong move looks less probable.


Uptrend is intact in Tata Steel


Tata Steel rose for the third consecutive week and was up over 5 per cent last week. The strong surge rally last week strengthens the overall uptrend. Support at ₹735 can limit the downside in the near term. Dips to this support may find fresh buyers coming into the market. The downside could be limited to the next significant support levels of ₹715 and ₹690 even if the stock declines, breaking below ₹735. But such a fall looks less likely. As such, the possibility of the stock sustaining above ₹735 is high . A rally to ₹800 is likely. A strong break above ₹800 will increase the likelihood of the up-move extending to ₹825 and ₹850 levels. An intermediate pull-back move from ₹850 levels to ₹800 or ₹750 cannot be ruled out. But the overall uptrend will continue to remain intact. Tata Steel is now all set to revisit ₹930 and ₹950 levels from a medium to long-term perspective. Investors can hold the long positions. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹640. Consider booking partial profits around ₹900 levels."
165,2018-01-08,Tata Steel,"2018 expected to be better for steel industry: Tata Steel CEO


TV Narendran, CEO and MD, Tata Steel




TV Narendran, CEO and MD, Tata Steel


Tata Steel on Monday expressed hope that the new year will be slightly better compared to the last two years as stability has returned to the steel sector globally.
Addressing a gathering on the new year, TV Narendran, CEO and Managing Director of Tata Steel, said 2017 was better compared to the preceding two years despite challenges.


Past challenges


In 2014, he said, Tata Steel had dealt with some challenges relating to closure of its mines because of change in regulations, while in 2015, China had increased its export volumes globally, including to India, which created a challenging atmosphere. However, Tata Steel continued to perform and grew during this period despite the odds, he said.
“Despite these challenges in the last two years, Tata Steel has continued to invest and has grown not only in the works but also in the township of Jamshedpur to improve facilities during this period,” Narendran said.
Recently, he said, the Tata Group Chairman and board members had visited Jamshedpur and they were “quite happy” with what they saw.
Emphasising on the need for competitiveness, he said that going forward, the competitiveness of the Jamshedpur plant will get challenged after 2030, when the mines it has at its disposal today would be put up for auction.


Global scenario


Later, talking to reporters, Narendran said there is stability in the steel sector globally and import of steel from China has come down to five million tonnes from 10 million tonnes because of anti-dumping duty and other temporary measures taken by the government.
Referring to the Kalinganagar project in Odisha, Narendran said the board has given its green signal to start the second phase of work there, which has achieved 100 per cent production level within a year of commission.
Describing the government’s action as positive in view of demand, he said, the consumption of steel would increase with infrastructure development in the country, and also the logistics cost, which was currently on the higher side compared to other countries, would come down with improvement in infrastructure.
On completion of three years by the Raghubar Das-led government in Jharkhand, Narendran said the government was successful in creating a name for the mineral-rich State during the period."
167,2018-01-09,Tata Steel,"Tata Chief's New Year message to staff: Focus on simplification, synergy and scale
Nearly 10 months after taking charge as the Chairman of Tata Sons, N Chandrasekaran has spelt out ‘simplification, synergy and scale’ as the focus areas for the group going forward. This includes reducing complexity across businesses, leveraging collaboration between group companies and scaling up through growth, consolidation and collaboration.
“In order to achieve peak performance, we must focus on three things: simplification, synergy and scale,” Chandra said in a New Year message to group employees. “To thrive in a world of rapid change, we need to reduce complexity across businesses and simplify. This will help us respond and react faster. It will also bring agility and spur faster decision-making across the group. We must make our management and organisation structures simpler and impactful.”


Chandra, who took up his new role in February, has taken some tough decisions including exiting the mobile services business and removing cross-holding between group companies.He has been pushing for driving synergies between group companies through the ‘One Tata’ concept. “One Tata, to my mind, is a mindset that brings the best of the group together for every opportunity. It is a journey that will allow us to discover the art of the possible when we work together. We are privileged to have a large and unique ecosystem to leverage ideas, knowledge, expertise and scale as well as work together to create disruptions. To grow and innovate consistently, we must anticipate synchronicity,” he said.
Chandra added that as a group, there is potential to scale up some of the businesses. “We must nurture the best talent amongst our associates and be agile in our thinking and execution, remaining strongly aligned to our motto ‘Leadership with Trust’.”
Commenting on the global economy, he said, “Globally, we find ourselves living in a time of deep transformation, with many exciting new developments, coupled with a heightened sense of uncertainty. On balance, I am firmly optimistic: the global economy is set to grow at 4 per cent YoY in 2018—the fastest pace since 2011.” “Global expansion in this coming phase of the cycle will rotate increasingly towards developing markets—especially India. The House of Tata remains a cornerstone of India’s growth story, and will continue to play an influential role on the global stage,” he said."
169,2018-01-09,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel sets eyes on raising ₹12,800 crore via rights issue
Tata Steel is planning to raise ₹12,800 crore through a rights issue to fund expansion of steel capacity to eight million tonnes a year from three million tonnes at its Kalinganagar plant in Odisha.
Besides using the capital for capacity expansion, Tata Steel will also utilise it to deleverage its balance sheet and scout for organic and inorganic growth, said a company statement on Tuesday.
Tata Steel is in the race for buying Essar Steel, which is being auctioned under NCLT-driven bad debt resolution process.
The board of directors of the company met here over the last two days to approve the fund-raising and capacity expansion proposals, said Tata Steel.
The company plans to complete the expansion project at Kalinganagar with an investment of ₹23,500 crore.
The project is expected to be completed in 48 months from the date of start of the project.
Tata Steel, with an annual capacity of 13 million tonnes, is currently logging in capacity utilisation of 98 per cent despite a marked slowdown in demand.
The company is raising production capabilities to meet the requirements of automotive, general engineering and other value-added segments.
The cost for ramping up the Kalinganagar facility includes raw material capacity expansion, upstream and midstream plants and a cold-rolling complex, it added. Though the demand is yet to revive in India, steel companies are betting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plans to build roads, ports and power plants.
The company is focussing on the Indian market after selling some of the unprofitable assets in the UK and agreeing to merge its European operations with Thyssenkrupp AG.
With Tata Steel’s European business set to be transferred to the proposed 50:50 joint venture with German industrial major Thyssenkrupp AG, the former will be looking to restructure the remaining debt on its balance sheet to more sustainable levels.
However, the proposal is awaiting regulatory clearances."

Joda East Iron Mine (JEIM) of Tata Steel has been honoured with the prestigious Golden Peacock Innovation Management Award for the year 2017 for driving innovation in mines.
The coveted award, given in recognition of innovation management, was received by Debashis Jena, Chief Joda, Tata Steel at Institute of Directors India’s 2nd Global Convention held at Singapore recently, a Tata Steel release said today.
Golden Peacock Awards Secretariat receives over 1,000 entries per year for various awards, from over 25 countries worldwide. The award provides not only worldwide recognition and prestige, but a competitive advantage in driving business, it said.
Joda East Iron Mine of Tata Steel is one of the fully mechanised captive iron mines of Tata Steel. It is rated five star category mines by the Government for doing sustainable mining.
Some of the innovations implemented in JEIM include digitisation in excavation of iron ore, use of iron waste for sustainable mining.
“We make every attempt to adopt best practices, modern technologies and innovation to ensure that our mining activities are efficient and sustainable having a positive impact on the triple bottom line. This recognition is a testimony to our commitment in pursuing excellence across our operations,” said Pankaj Satija, General Manager (Ore Mines & Quarries), Tata Steel."
178,2018-01-09,Tata Steel,"No market will beat India’s growth: Chandra
N Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Sons, has asked Group companies to focus on the opportunities in the Indian market.
He also said that apart from Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Consultancy Services, the group wants an improved play in financial services, infrastructure, consumer businesses, and in travel and hospitality.
In an interview given to Tata Review, the in-house magazine of the Tata Group, Chandrasekaran said: “The opportunity for many of our businesses in India is fantastic. They should use this opportunity to make investments and participate in and contribute to India’s growth story. I’m quite bullish about the country’s economic prospects.”
“No other market, I believe, is going to grow faster than India in the next 10-20 years. Considering our demographic profile, we will have a consumer population that is going to have higher spending power. It’s a massive market, the biggest game in town,” he added.




On the issue of having too many companies within the Tata fold, Chandrasekaran said: “We have far too many companies in the Tata Group and some level of consolidation is essential. Our aim should be to achieve the optimal level of consolidation without losing the entrepreneurial spirit that we are famous for. We have not worked out all the details. We have our thoughts on this and we will consider them carefully.”
Chandrasekaran, who was appointed as the Chairman of Tata Sons after the acrimonious exit of Cyrus Mistry, said that he is driving synergies within the group through the ‘One Tata’ concept. “One Tata will certainly have a financial impact. In addition, it will also be beneficial for our employees, their career paths as well as the wider community. A fundamental element of One Tata is to affect the thinking of our senior leaders and to ensure that they cascade it down the line to their teams. It’s not rocket science; it’s a shift in thinking and mindset,” he said.
On the issue of pruning unprofitable businesses, Chandrasekaran said hard decisions are inevitable.
“In a business group, you constantly have to take decisions that make financial sense. I have clearly stated the emphasis on returns and capital allocation, but that does not mean we will exit a business that does not meet our targets. We will always work hard together to realise the potential of every Tata business. There will be times, though, when hard decisions are inevitable.”
He said that businesses will have to strive for top performance and will be held accountable.
“We have to be performing at the highest level in every business we are in. If we have underperformed the competition, while the market or that industry has potential, then we must be held accountable. It’s not good enough to say this year was better than last year.”"

Thyssenkrupp is prepared to offer workers commitments on jobs and investments to get union backing for its deal with Tata Steel to merge their European steel operations, German weekly Bild am Sonntag reported, citing an internal memo.
“We are prepared to make wide-ranging commitments on the topics that are most important to our employees,” the paper quoted Thyssenkrupp personnel chief Oliver Burkhard as telling managers in the memo. “That concerns for instance securing sites, future investments and job security. With our proposal, we want to secure jobs at the future joint venture into the next decade,” he said. Thyssenkrupp declined to comment on the report.
German labour union IG Metall had given Thyssenkrupp until December 22 to agree to guarantees on jobs, plants and investments, putting further pressure on Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger, who has said he wants the approval of shop stewards for the merger plan.
Hiesinger hopes to reach a final deal with Tata Steel in early 2018 but that depends on whether he can get it passed by Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board, where workers' representatives have called for jobs and plants to be secure for 10 years.
Labour leaders hold half of the 20 seats on Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board, and while a deal can still be pushed through without their consent, their approval could significantly smooth the transaction."
174,2018-01-09,Tata Steel,"Sebi levies Rs 10 lakh fine on Tata Steel
Capital markets regulator Sebi has levied a fine of Rs 10 lakh on Tata Steel for delay in disclosing the increase in its shareholding in Tinplate Company of India, a group company.
In September 2009, Tinplate had announced rights issue of 4.32 crore equity shares to its existing shareholders. Along with this it had also issued 1.80 crore fully convertible debentures in the ratio of 5 debentures for every eight equity shares.
In its order pronounce on Thursday, Sebi observed that Tata Steel had subscribed to and was allotted 1.33 crore equity shares and 55.46 lakh fully convertible debentures as part of the equity and debenture issuance. This apart, Tata Steel was also subscribed to an additional 86.73 lakh equity shares and 1.17 crore fully convertible debentures.
Post allotment of equity shares, Tata Steel stake in Tinplate increased from 30.82 per cent to 42.88 per cent. Upon this increase, it was supposed to make the necessary disclosures within two working days to Tinplate as required under Sebi regulations. However, Tata Steel disclosured belatedly on July 2, 2012.
Further, on April 1, 2011, Tinplate again allotted 3.14 crore equity shares to Tata Steel pursuant to the rights issue and in terms of the letter of offer dated September 3, 2009. This led to further increase in Tata Steel holding to 59.44 per cent from 42.88 per cent. This disclosure was also delayed and made only on May 13, 2011.
Subsequently, Tata Steel’s stake in Tinplate rose to 73.44 per cent in September 2012 following an open offer, and further to 74.96 per cent in May 2014 pursuant to a scheme of amalgamation.
Tata Steel made a submission to Sebi that the lapse on its part was technical in nature and the same should be condoned or a nominal penalty may be imposed on it. Sebi imposed Rs 10 lakh fine, saying it is commensurate with the defaults committed by the company."

163,2018-01-14,Tata Steel,"Weekly trading guide: SBI, ITC, Infosys, RIL, Tata Steel
SBI (₹301.8) fell for the third consecutive week. The stock was down 1.4 per cent last week. The near-term outlook remains bearish. A fall below ₹300 towards ₹296 and ₹294 is likely in the coming days. If SBI manages to reverse higher from around ₹294, a relief rally to ₹300 is possible initially. A break above ₹300 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹305 or even ₹310 thereafter. But if SBI breaks decisively below ₹294, there is a strong likelihood of the downmove extending further to ₹285. The region around ₹285 is a key short-term support with the potential to halt the current downmove. A strong upward reversal from around ₹285 will increase the possibility of the stock rallying towards ₹300 or even higher thereafter. As such the price action around ₹285 will need a close watch to get a cue on the next leg of move. Traders can hold the short positions. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹310. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹303 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹299 for the target of ₹294.
ITC (₹267.5) surged over 4 per cent intra-week, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹267 and made a high of ₹273.8 last week. However, it fell back from the week’s high giving back most of the gains to close the week just 1.7 per cent higher. Immediate support is at ₹266. If ITC manages to reverse higher again from this support in the coming days, it can strengthen the bullish momentum and go to ₹272 and ₹273 levels again. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹273 will then pave the way for the next target of ₹280. Even if the stock breaks below ₹266 this week, the next significant supports between ₹264 and ₹263 and then at ₹260 can limit the downside. The outlook will turn bearish only if ITC declines decisively below ₹260, which looks less probable at the moment. Traders can hold the long positions with the revised stop-loss at ₹265 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹268 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹272. Short-term traders who do not hold any positions can initiate fresh long positions at current levels and also accumulate on dips at ₹264. Keep the stop-loss at ₹259 for the target of ₹280. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹270 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹274.
The prolonged wait is over. Infosys (₹1,078.4) finally cleared the key hurdle of ₹1,045 after struggling for over 14 months. The stock surged over 6 per cent last week to close on a strong note above ₹1,045. This gives an initial confirmation that the downtrend that was in place since June 2016 has reversed. Infosys is now all set to target ₹1,350 over the long-term. A near-term dip to ₹1,050-₹1,045 cannot be ruled out before the stock extends its upmove. Strong support is now available in the broad ₹1,045-₹1,000 region. Only a decisive fall below ₹1,000 will turn the outlook bearish. But such a break is unlikely as any intermediate dips in the stock will now attract fresh buyers. Next resistance is at ₹1,120 which is likely to be tested in the short-term. A strong break above ₹1,120 will then clear the way for the next target of ₹1,200 over the medium-term. Investors can hold the long positions. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go long on dips at ₹1,060 and accumulate at ₹1,050. Keep the stop-loss at ₹980 for the target of ₹1,180.
RIL (₹946.7) surged breaking above the key resistance level of ₹937 last week. The stock was up 2.6 per cent last week. The region between ₹937 and ₹935 will now serve as a strong support for the stock in the near-term. As long as the stock remains above this support zone, there is a strong likelihood of it rallying to test the crucial resistance level of ₹960 in the coming days. Whether it breaks above ₹960 or not will then determine the next move. A strong break above ₹960 will boost the momentum. Such a break will pave the way for RIL to target the psychological ₹1,000 mark going forward. It will also wipe out the threat of the double-top reversal pattern formation on the chart that we have been reiterating in this column over the last few weeks. But if the stock reverses lower from ₹960 it can fall to ₹940 or ₹935 again. The possibility of the stock extending its downmove towards ₹910 or even ₹900 cannot be ruled out. In such a scenario, RIL can remain in the ₹880-₹960 sideways range for some more time.
After a strong surge for three consecutive weeks, the rally in Tata Steel (₹771) paused last week. The stock was stuck in a narrow range between ₹760 and ₹780 last week. Resistance is around ₹785. As long as the stock remains below this hurdle, an intermediate dip to ₹745 or ₹740 cannot be ruled out. Further fall below ₹740 looks less probable at the moment. A range bound move with a bullish bias between ₹740 and ₹785 can be seen for some time in such a scenario. An eventual break and a decisive weekly close above ₹785 will boost the momentum. Such a break will take the stock higher to the next targets of ₹830 and ₹850. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹930 and ₹950 over the long-term. Investors can hold the long positions. Retain the stop-loss at ₹640 and revise it higher to ₹680 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹800. As mentioned last week, investors can consider booking partial profits around ₹900 levels. A trendline support at ₹710 and the 100-day moving average at ₹694 are the key supports for Tata Steel. The outlook will turn negative only if it declines below ₹694 decisively, which looks unlikely at the moment.

162,2018-01-18,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel launches branded LD slag products
Tata Steel today announced launch of two new products, branded LD slag products for applications in road, fly ash brick and clinker making.
The introduction of the two new branded products Tata Aggreto and Tata Nirman is by industrial by-products management division of the steel major.
LD slag is a byproduct of the Linz-Donawitz process which is produced as pig iron and is processed into crude steel.
Tata Steel produces a wide range of industrial by-products which serve as key raw materials for various industries, the company said in a statement.
The company said it has pioneered value creation out of by-products as part of its quest to contribute to a sustainable ecosystem.
The addition of these two branded products in Tata Steel’s portfolio will be significant for the company and the industry as it marks India’s first step in the branded products category for processed steel slag."
161,2018-01-19,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel raises $1.3 billion via bond issue
Tata Steel has raised $1.3 billion (about Rs 8,300 crore) through issuance of unsecured bonds in two tranches in the international markets to repay overseas debt and improve credit profile of the company.
The bond issue comprised $300 million of 4.45 per cent unsecured bonds due on July 24, 2023 and $1 billion of 5.45 per cent unsecured bonds due on January 24, 2028. It was issued by Abja Investment Co Pte, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel incorporated in Singapore. The bonds are rated BB- by S&P and will be listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX).
The company had conducted simultaneous roadshows in Dubai, Singapore, London and Hong Kong. Launched on January 18, the bonds at peak attracted a demand worth over $7 billion across tranches and enabled the company to price the issue at about 42 basis points more than the initial price thoughts on both the tranches.
The deal was distributed to a wide number of long term buy-and-hold institutional investors, banks and private banks across regions.
Koushik Chatterjee, ED and CFO, Tata Steel, said proceeds of the bonds will be used to refinance the offshore obligations of the group, which will help de-risk the balance sheet, enhance financial flexibility, diversify the investor base and improve the overall debt maturity profile.
Completion of the refinancing also marks an important step forward to create a sustainable financial structure in preparation for the proposed joint venture in Europe, he said."
160,2018-01-19,Tata Steel,"Misselling concerns: Police to probe advice given to British Steel pension plan members
Police in South Wales, where Tata Steel’s Port Talbot works are based, have begun an investigation following concerns about the financial advice given by pension advisory firms to members of the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS).
“South Wales police is aware of recent media reports surrounding a pension scheme concerning steel workers at Port Talbot and is currently reviewing certain information that has been brought to our attention,” said a police spokesperson in a statement on Friday.
Tata Steel offloaded the pension scheme last year as part of a restructuring to ensure a viable future for its European steel operations.
Last week, Britain’s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, said it was continuing to look into concerns expressed by members of the BSPS about the suitability of the advice they received about transferring out of it following the restructuring (the BSPS closed to future accrual in March last year).
So far, eight firms have stopped advising pension scheme members following the FCA investigation, which continues looking into the firms that had been most active in advising consumers to transfer out of the BSPS.
The government-backed Pension Advisory Service has set up a dedicated helpline for members of the scheme.
Concerns about the advice given to members of the scheme have been building since last year.
Last week, Frank Field, Chair of the House of Commons work and pensions committee, criticised the FCA’s “grossly inadequate” action on the BSPS members’ concerns and said the developments highlighted the risk of “sleepwalking” into a huge misselling scandal.
The committee highlighted the instance of one firm, Active Wealth, which had advised over 300 clients on BSPS transfers.
The committee criticised the fact it had taken the FCA 14 months to require Active Wealth from ceasing to advise on new pension business, just weeks before the original decision for BSPS members to make a decision on their pension.
“From their intervention in this affair it seems clear that the FCA’s actions still effectively protect these businesses’ ability to make money out of pension funds, rather than protecting pension savers,” warned Field.
In August last year Tata Steel UK reached an agreement with the Trustee of the BSPS and UK authorities to offload the £15-billion pension scheme via a regulated apportionment arrangement — a restructuring mechanism that allows an employer under financial pressures to detach itself from its pension liabilities.
At the time Tata Steel hailed the development as one that would help it towards a “sustainable and enduring future”.
Unions had welcomed the agreement and the plans for a new Tata-backed scheme. Members of the scheme could transfer either to a Tata Steel-backed scheme, remain with the existing scheme, which would move into Britain’s Pension Protection Fund, or enrol in a private pension scheme."

“We see great opportunity to grow in India and we have said we want to grow in India. We are well-positioned because we have organic and inorganic opportunities to grow,” Tata Steel Global CEO and Managing Director, T V Narendran, had said yesterday.
Narendran was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of Kolkata Literary Meet 2018 which began yesterday.
“Inorganic opportunities come in a while and we need to pursue them. Let us see what happens.

Tata Steel has bid for companies like Bhushan Steel, Essar Steel and Electrosteel Steels. Narendran said the company’s Kalinganagar project in Odisha has shaped up well and it is in full production. ""It is also the right time to plan for the second phase which is already approved by the board,'' he said.
Tata Steel board has approved the next phase of capacity expansion in Kalinganagar to 8 million tonnes per annum from 3 million tonnes at present. The board has also approved a rights issue for an amount up to Rs 12,800 crore.

Besides JSW Steel, Luxembourg-based multinational steel firm ArcelorMittal and domestic industry major Tata Steel and are said to be in race for Bhushan Steel.


 Five hundred employees of Bhushan Steel in partnership with a Singapore-based fund have placed a bid for acquiring the stressed asset of Bhushan Steel. 
They are in a race against JSW Steel and Tata Steel, the two other bidders.
The deadline, which was extended twice, ended at 6 pm on Saturday. The winning bid will be announced on Tuesday.
JSW Steel has joined hands with Piramal Enterprises after Japanese steel company JFE pulled out of the partnership at the last moment. Contrary to market expectations, Arcelor Mittal did not put in a bid. 
Unlike Monnet Ispat, where bids were sought online, the Bhushan Steel resolution professional decided to accept bids in physical form at the company’s Gurgaon office.
Fierce bidding
The bidding for Bhushan Steel was fierce as the committee of creditors has decided to negotiate only with the highest bidder. 
It is learnt that JSW Steel and Tatas have submitted bids at about ₹30,000 crore, almost double the liquidation value of the company. 
The acceptance of bids after the deadline expired has resulted in heartburn among some companies, who feel their bids may have been leaked to competitors.
Bhushan Steel is one of the biggest among the 40 non-performing accounts listed by the Reserve Bank of India. 
The company has 5.6 million tonne production capacity in Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh), Khopoli (Maharashtra) and Dhenkanal (Odisha). It had outstanding debt stood of ₹46,263 crore as on March 31, 2017. 
It reported a net loss of ₹3,501 crore for the fiscal on revenues of ₹15,027 crore."

Tata Steel has reported nearly five-fold increase in its consolidated December quarter net profit at ₹1,136 crore (₹232 crore), largely due to better realisation in India and revival of demand in Europe.
Sales were up 14 per cent at ₹33,100 crore (₹28,912 crore). The company has made a provision of ₹1,115 crore towards penalty levied by the regulatory authorities on mining.
Tata Steel has to shut down operations at the Kalinganagar plant due to unexpected failure of auxiliary equipment. As the downstream operations are integrated to the blast furnace, it has to suspend production at the steel smelting shop and hot strip mills. The company expects to restart production in the next seven to 10 days.
The rights issue to raise ₹12,800 crore will be open between February 14 and 28. It will issue about 15.54 crore fully paid shares not exceeding ₹8,000 crore at ₹510 a share and another about 7.76 crore partially paid shares not exceeding ₹4,800 crore at ₹615 a piece. It has invested ₹2,002 crore during the quarter under review.
On a standalone basis, the company’s net profit and turnover were up 11 per cent each at ₹1,338 crore (₹1,205 crore) and ₹15,596 crore (₹14,106 crore). EBITDA was up 37 per cent at ₹4,647 crore (₹3,393 crore) on better realisation.
Steel sales were up 10 per cent at 3.30 million tonnes (2.99 mt).
TV Narendran, Managing Director, said sales volume growth was strong in India across verticals and increase realisations. The planned maintenance and upgrades in Europe to enhance long-term capability hit operations, he said.
The focus in India will be to expand Kalinganagar plant and pursue inorganic growth. The process for entering into a joint venture with Thyssenkrupp in Europe is progressing well, he added.
Gross debt fell by ₹1,658 crore to ₹88,601 crore due to repayment and positive impact of forex. It had reserves of ₹22,544 crore consisting of ₹12,681 crore in cash and cash equivalent and ₹9,863 crore in undrawn bank lines.

152,2018-02-12,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel jumps over 5% on robust earnings
 Shares of Tata Steel rose more than 5 per cent in the morning trade as the company has reported a five-fold jump in its third quarter profit.
Tata Steel had on February 9 reported a five-fold rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,135.92 crore for the third quarter ended December 31. It had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 231.90 crore in the same quarter of last fiscal.
Due to buoyant results, the shares of the company opened on a bullish note at Rs 718, up 5.02 per cent over the previous close. On a similar note, the stock opened at Rs 716 on the NSE, registering a jump of 4.47 per cent over its previous closing price.
The stock was the second highest gainer on the benchmark index Sensex.
The company’s consolidated income during October-December quarter increased to Rs 33,672.48 crore from Rs 29,154.75 crore in the year-ago period.
Over the last nine months, Tata Steel had delivered strong consolidated operational performance across geographies and the company expects this momentum to continue as markets are expected to remain favourable, its CEO and MD T V Narendran said.
“Globally, steel prices have been buoyant with improved trade position in China along with cost push from raw materials...In India, we have witnessed strong volume growth across the verticals as well as an increase in realisations,” Narendran added.
The company’s Executive Director and CFO, Koushik Chatterjee, said that Tata Steel group revenues witnessed robust growth driven by improved volumes in India and stronger realisations across geographies, on the back of improvement in commodity prices."
151,2018-02-12,Tata Steel,"Improved volumes and better realisation drive performance of Tata Steel
 Tata Steel reported a four-fold increase in profits in the latest December quarter on the back of improved volumes in the domestic market and better realisations across markets. The company has recorded a consolidated profit of Rs 1,136 crore for the quarter ending December 2017, against Rs 232 crore for the same period a year ago.
Consolidated revenues for the quarter were at Rs 33,447 crore, which was higher by 15 per cent y-o-y and 3 per cent q-o-q. The company has recorded its highest ever quarterly sales of 3.3 million tonnes (mt) in the December quarter, which is a 10 per cent growth y-o-y. Indian operations contributed to about 50 per cent of overall volumes, a growth of 7 per cent q-o-q and 10 per cent y-o-y. 
Volumes in the Indian steel market are currently driven by healthy demand from the auto and capital goods sector. While demand from construction is muted, it is expected to improve in the January to June period, usually regarded as a good period for construction. 
The European performance was, however, weak owing to higher costs and reduced volumes attributed to the shutdown of the plant for maintenance activities. However, performance is expected to improve in the coming quarters. 
The consolidated operating profit for the December quarter stood at Rs 5,801 crore, which is a rise of about 59 per cent y-o-y. Nearly 80 per cent of the operating profit was contributed by Indian operations due to the cyclical upturn in the commodities market that led to better realisations. Operating profit per tonne for the Indian operations has increased from nearly Rs 11,000 per tonne in the September quarter to Rs 14,000 per tonne in the December quarter. Also, the reduction of coking coal consumption cost has aided profitability. The company’s continued efforts to reduce the consumption of coking coal, will help bring down raw material cost further.
The overall EBITDA margins have improved from 12.4 per cent in the September quarter to 17 per cent in the December quarter.
Tata Steel has also achieved its best ever quarterly sales in the higher margin segments such as automotive and branded products, among others.
Good times ahead
Going forward, the outlook for the steel industry as a whole looks positive. The World Steel Association has estimated the growth of steel demand at 5.3 per cent in 2018. Steel prices are also expected to be healthy with revival in the domestic market. Tata Steel is well placed to reap the benefits.
In respect of the joint venture with Thyssenkrupp to restructure the European steel business, for which the memorandum of understanding was signed in September 2017, the company continues to expect cost synergies to the effect of €400 million to €600 million from the joint venture perspective. This is also expected to deconsolidate the debt by about €2.5 billion from the group’s balance sheet, which will be transferred to the joint venture. However, the details of the synergies and the timeline will be available only once the definitive agreement is made with Thyssenkrupp.
The board has also approved the 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) capacity expansion at Kalinganagar port that includes investment in upstream facilities, 2.2 mtpa cold rolling mill, and raw material facilities. The total project cost is estimated at Rs 23,500 crore. The company has spent a capex of about Rs 5,320 crore out of the planned expenditure of Rs 7,000 crore for FY18."

 Tata Steel will finance the repair of a blast furnace at Britain's largest steelworks in Port Talbot, Wales, extending its life by seven years and soothing concerns about its commitment to Europe's steel sector, four sources told Reuters.
Tata Steel signed a preliminary deal last year to merge its European steel assets with those of Germany's Thyssenkrupp in a move driven chiefly by a need to address steelmaking overcapacity in Europe.
Fully relining a blast furnace typically costs over 150 million pounds ($200 million) and gives the furnace an additional 20 years of life approximately, while the repairs Tata is looking at will cost about half of that, the industry sources said.
Tata Steel declined to comment.
With earnings at the Port Talbot running at a fraction of those at Tata and Thyssenkrupp's European assets and Britain's exit from the EU posing extra risks, the plant was seen as particularly vulnerable in the event of a downturn.
Concerns receding
But with Tata Steel looking to extend the life of one of its two Port Talbot blast furnaces and a new vision at the firm's Indian parent following a top level management change last year, industry sources say those concerns are receding.
“We are nowhere near where we were two years ago,” one industry source said, referring to the steel sector crisis of late 2015 in which Tata attempted to sell the its UK assets, including the Port Talbot plant which was losing 1 million pounds a day at one point.
Under the terms of a deal Tata signed with British unions in late 2016, the company committed to no forced redundancies at Port Talbot and to keeping a two blast furnace operations at the plant until 2021.
Given that the blast furnace Tata is looking to repair - blast furnace five - was due to end its life in 2018-19, the company was obliged to do something to extend its life by another two years.
Tata is, however, going beyond that with more costly, long-term repairs. It is also investing more than the 100 million pounds a year it committed to spend on its UK assets over the next decade under its deal with unions.
Investment in mills
Earlier this month, Tata said it had invested more than £14 million in one of its Port Talbot mills, in a move that would increase capacity by 150,000 tonnes per year. In November, it announced £30 million of investments in the plant.
The Community union, representing workers at Port Talbot, will continue to push for a full reline of blast furnace five, said Steve McCool, the union's national officer.
The global steel sector is emerging from a crisis in which global prices slid to 12-year lows in late 2015, resulting in plant closures, capacity reductions, and thousands of jobs cuts. Prices have since recovered some 60 percent, according to consultants MEPS.
Tata on Friday reported a five-fold increase in third-quarter profit, boosted by strong volume growth in India and rising steel prices. Shares in the company have risen some 6 per cent since the results were published."

A committee of MPs in Britain have criticised Tata Steel UK, the UK government and the financial services and pensions regulator and others over a pensions mis-selling scandal that led to members of the British Steel Pension Scheme being “exploited for cynical personal gain.” 
The report relates to concerns around the financial advice provided to members of the pension scheme by pensions advisory firms. Last year an agreement was struck with UK pension authorities, following much negotiation, and the payment of half-a-billion pounds and an equity stake, which will separate the £15-billion British Steel Pension Scheme from Tata Steel UK, improving the company’s economic viability.
Concerns began to swiftly mount over the advice given to members by pension advisory firms on whether to remain with the existing scheme (which will enter the Pension Protection Fund, the government scheme that covers members of pension scheme that fall into insolvency), or transfer to a new defined contribution scheme being set up by Tata Steel or transfer into a third party scheme.
“Many BSPS members were shamelessly bamboozled into signing up to ongoing adviser fees and unsuitable funds characterised by high investment risk, high management charges and punitive exit fees,” said the report by the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee published on Thursday. It warned of another “major mis-selling scandal,” as it pointed to a catalogue of failures that “created perfect conditions for vultures to take advantage.”
The report criticised the UK financial services regulator the FCA for the length of time it took to begin investigating the matter, but also reserved its criticism for the handling of the situation by Tata Steel. “The outlines of a deal to save the sponsoring employer of the BSPS, Tata Steel UK, have been in place since May 2017. The scheme’s members were apparently neglected by the signatories: the company, the Government and the pensions regulator…. Many members had lost trust in the sponsor company and its pension pledges. The scheme was under-resourced and unable to provide basic facts to inform a complex choice. A member communication plan proved woefully inadequate.”
However, it concluded that no changes should be made to the deal to save Tata Steel UK, which had been carefully constructed to a tight timetable. “it is vital that it proceeds…. the Government should, however, draw on the BSPS experience and ensure that an adequate legislative framework is in place for similar future deals.”
Last month Britain’s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority said it was looking  into concerns expressed by members of the BSPS about the suitability of the advice they received. A number of firms have stopped advising pension scheme members following the FCA investigation. It also emerged that around 25,000 of the 122,000 members of pension scheme, which closed to new accruals in March last year, did not return their option forms, triggering criticisms from unions about the handling of the situation.
 
“The consultation process was a major undertaking involving complex financial detail and more than 120,000 people,” said a spokesperson for Tata Steel. “The Trustee supported members through the consultation process with personal information packs, 41 roadshows across the country and a free helpline service. We were pleased so many BSPS members made a positive choice to select the best scheme for their future and were pleased the Regulatory Apportionment Arrangement process in this case was able to offer all members the choice between the PPF and an alternative scheme. We were also pleased to note the Trustee expects the new scheme to pass the agreed qualifying conditions to go forward. Although much work is still needed to deliver a secure future in our UK business, the progress with pensions is welcome"""

Shares of Bhushan Steel rose 19.9 per cent to Rs 53.90 on the NSE to post its biggest intra-day gain since October 23, 2017. Over 1.37 crore shares were traded on the platform. Bhushan Steel shares soared close to 20 per cent to hit upper circuit limit of Rs 53.85 on the BSE and trading volume spurted more than 1.37 times with over 27 lakh shares changing hands, exchange data showed.
Debt-laden Bhushan Steel Ltd today said Tata Steel, JSW Living Pvt Ltd and a consortium of the company’s own employees have submitted bids to take over its assets.  The company in a filing to the BSE said that as part of the resolution process, “the resolution professional (RP) has received resolution plans from Tata Steel, JSW Living Private Ltd and Employees of Bhushan Steel Ltd“.
JSW Living Pvt Ltd is a joint venture between JSW and Piramal Enterprises.
A broad summary of the resolution plans were presented by the RP to the committee of creditors (CoC) in their meeting held on February 16, 2018, Bhushan Steel said.
The company further said that the RP and its advisors will now review the plans so as to ensure that these plans are in conformity with the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, and additional requirements as stipulated by the CoC in the process document. .
“Once the resolution plans are identified, another meeting of CoC will be convened to present the compliant plans for the consideration of the CoC,” Bhushan Steel said.
When asked about Tata Steel’s bid offer, its managing director and CEO TV Narendran said, “I would not comment on the numbers. Media report says we are the highest ... if media reports about other bids are right then probably we are the highest.” The company was interested in these assets right from the beginning because these are in the eastern region, he told reporters on the sidelines of an event organised by CII here.
Bhushan Steel, one of the 12 non-performing accounts referred by the Reserve Bank of India for National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) proceedings, owes Rs 44,478 crore to its lenders. It makes auto-grade steel in India.
According to the Bhushan Steel’s website, it is the third largest secondary steel producer in the country with annual capacity of 5.6 million tonne. 
Tata Steel shares end down 5.82%
Tata Steel fell as much 7 per cent to Rs 642, in its biggest intra-day percentage drop since November 2016. The stock ended lower by 5.82 per cent or Rs 40.05  at Rs 648.25 on the BSE. 
JSW Steel dropped as much as 5.8 per cent to Rs 295 intra-day. The stock ended the day down 2.97 per cent at Rs 302.45. 
Tata Steel shares fell as its offer for Bhushan was at a premium, potentially hurting Tata's profitability. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio will get distorted as its total debt is going to more than triple, while EBITDA will not even double, according to an analyst with a domestic brokerage, who did not want to be identified.
Bhushan's lenders now will have to take a haircut of as little as 30 per cent as opposed to previously expected 50 per cent, according to an analyst."

 Debt-laden Bhushan Steel Ltd today said Tata Steel, JSW Living Pvt Ltd and a consortium of the company’s own employees have submitted bids to take over its assets.
The company in a filing to BSE said that as part of the resolution process, “the resolution professional (RP) has received resolution plans from Tata Steel, JSW Living Private Ltd and Employees of Bhushan Steel Ltd“.
JSW Living Pvt Ltd is a joint venture between JSW and Piramal Enterprises.
Bhushan Steel shares soared close to 20 per cent to hit upper circuit limit of Rs 53.85 on BSE. Trading volume spurted more than 1.37 times on BSE with over 27 lakh shares changing hands, exchange data showed.

Tata Trusts and Telangana Government have signed an agreement to establish a network of cancer care facilities in the State.
A memorandum of understanding was inked in the presence of Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus, Tata Sons, here today, whose objective is to provide affordable cancer care that is accessible to all.
Various cancer care facilities will be made available through a three-tier model, which include developing academic and research capabilities in the State.
As a part of this initiative, it is proposed to set up a chain of cancer screening centres in the State. Since detection of cancer symptoms early is key to providing effective treatment, the proposed move to set up a chain of cancer care centres and back it up with a Digital Nerve Centre, where all the information about a patient is stores and accessible at a click of a button.
Speaking at the event, Ratan Tata said, “Cancer is a disease that does not pick a person based on whether he is rich or poor. It does not distinguish. Therefore, there is need to provide everyone access to medicine.”
Cancer treatment 
“Our focus is on to provide better facilities for treatment of cancer. I hope we can do more. This would not have been possible but for lot of work and energy put behind by people,” he said.
The network of cancer care facilities aims to ensure that no patient travels more than few hours for accessing the full suite of cancer treatment services. It is proposed to use technology and shift task to facilitate operations in remote areas.
Tata Trusts has brought together a diverse group of oncologists, leading cancer hospitals attached to the national cancer grid, engineers and contractors to be able to deliver on the infrastructure to deliver cancer diagnosis and treatment.
Long travel
Ratan Tata said, “Patients will no longer need to travel all the way to Hyderabad except for rare and complex conditions.”
Tata Trusts has had similar initiatives, which are at different stages of implementation in Assam, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.
KT Rama Rao, State IT and Industries Minister, said, “The youngest State is in the process of bringing about transformation in the healthcare sector whose focus would be to provide accessible healthcare.”"

Tata Steel has committed ₹45,400 crore for Bhushan Steel, far outbidding JSW Living’s offer of ₹28,000 crore for the stressed asset.
This is the first instance of the resolution of a stressed asset under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016.
Tata Steel has offered to pay Bhushan Steel’s financial creditor ₹35,200 crore, while operational creditors would get ₹1,200 crore.
Tata Steel will invest ₹9,000 crore towards working capital requirements, sources close to the company said.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, Tata Steel said it had received a formal communication from the Resolution Professional of Bhushan Steel Limited that it had been identified the “highest evaluated compliant resolution applicant to acquire controlling stake of Bhushan Steel”.
The next step in the resolution process will be as per stipulations under the IBC’s Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process.
The announcement will come as a major confidence builder for public sector banks, which are struggling to recover loans extended to the highly-leveraged steel sector. Tata Steel’s hefty bid of ₹45,400 crore will imply minimal haircut for Bhushan Steel lenders who had put the company on the block to recover ₹56,000 crore.
For Tata Steel, this could mean that its overall debt could increase further. The company itself has gross debt of ₹88,000 crore as of December quarter and it could cross ₹1 lakh crore in next two-three years. In 2008, Tata Steel had bid for Anglo-Dutch company Corus.
JSW Living is a joint venture between JSW and Piramal Enterprises.
Bhushan Steel, which makes auto-grade steel, has an annual production capacity of 5.6 million tonnes. The company reported a net loss of ₹1,607 crore in the December quarter against net loss of ₹743 crore in the year-ago period."
145,2018-03-08,Tata Steel,"Steal the rights
Shareholders of Tata Steel can subscribe to the rights issue of ₹12,800 crore , given that it is priced attractively relative to the current market price of the company. The company offers four fully paid-up and two partly paid-up shares for every 25 ordinary shares held by a shareholder as on the record date — February 1, 2018.
Nearly 75 per cent of the proceeds will be utilised to repay the existing debts and the balance for general corporate purposes. Each fully paid-up and partly paid-up share is being offered at a price of ₹510 and ₹615 respectively. In the case of partly paid-up shares, nearly 25 per cent is to be paid on application and the balance on full and final calls that will be made by the company within 12 months.
Clearly, the price at which rights issue is made by the company is attractive when compared to the current market price.
If an eligible shareholder subscribes to both the fully and partly paid up shares, the average cost for right shares would be ₹545 per share.
Even in this case, the offer is reasonably at a discount to the current market price. It is a good opportunity for an investor who bought the stock at higher prices to bring down the overall cost of investment . However, the rights issue will dilute the EPS (earnings per share) of the company in the near term.
Apart from pricing, the company’s prospects in the near-to-medium term look positive, with its focus on Indian operations, possession of captive iron ore and coal mines, restructuring activities at Europe and the prevalence of favourable steel markets domestically and globally.
At ₹677, the stock now trades at 35 times its trailing 12-month earnings. This seemingly high valuation is largely due to the write-offs and losses in the European business that dragged down consolidated earnings. According to Bloomberg’s estimated earnings for FY18, the stock trades at a reasonable 13 times, which is attractive when compared to other major steel players in the market that trade at over 16 times.
It is to be noted that the PE figures calculated based on estimated earnings have not factored in the debt repayment out of the proceeds of rights issue, which therefore will not alter the interest payment for calculating the EPS.
Tata Steel’s India business, the major profit contributor, is on a strong footing with good growth in volumes and price realisations. This has been aided by increasing global demand, including from China and the production cuts there. The first phase (3 mtpa) of the technologically-efficient Kalinganagar steel plant that started commercial operations in May 2016, is now operating at full capacity.
The company’s board has recently approved the five million tonnes per annum (mtpa) capacity expansion at Kalinganagar port at a total estimated project cost of ₹23,500 crore.
In addition, Tata Steel is also planning to acquire the stressed steel assets such as Electro Steel, Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Steel and Power. These acquisitions, if successful, are expected to help the company in strengthening its operations in India.
However, Tata Steel will have the pressure of high debt levels if stressed assets are acquired at higher valuations. Its net debt stood at ₹78,000 crore by September 30 , 2017.
Captive mines would ensure that the company will not be impacted by the raw material fluctuations in the market.
The recent agreement with Thyssenkrupp AG to restructure the European steel business is expected to bring good tidings to the company. The company expects cost synergies to the tune of €400 million to €600 million from the joint venture . About €2.5 billion of debt from the group’s balance sheet will be transferred to the joint venture.
However, the benefits from this arrangement are expected to be realised only from FY2020.
After deterioration for many years, primarily due to its woes in Europe, Tata Steel’s financials have been improving over the past year or so.
The recent quarter has also been good for the company. The overall EBITDA margins have improved from 12.4 per cent in the September quarter to 17 per cent in the December quarter with revenue growth of 15 per cent Y-o-Y."
142,2018-03-08,Tata Steel,"Synergy benefits for Tata Steel from Bhushan acquisition 
 The news of Tata Steel’s winning bid for Bhushan Steel sent the shares of the latter soaring by over 12 per cent on Thursday. However, the proposed acquisition seems to have been factored in the stock price of Tata Steel already, as seen from the relatively muted reaction of its stock prices. 
Tata Steel made a Rs 45,400-crore bid for distressed steel company, Bhushan Steel, which is undergoing proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). According to research from Emkay Global, Bhushan Steel can generate EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax and epreciation) of Rs 50-60 billion. But, it believes that Tata Steel’s bid for Bhushan Steel is on the higher side compared to other competitors’ bid.
High debt levels
Tata Steel’s net debt stood at nearly Rs 76,000 crore as of December 2017. The debt level is expected to cross Rs 1 lakh crore after the proposed acquisition. It is to be noted that the proceeds of the recent rights issue made by Tata Steel will be used to repay up to Rs 9,000 crore of the existing debt by the end of the next financial year.
Synergy benefits
Bhushan Steel’s production capacity is 5.6 million tonnes and it has its plants at Sahibabad, Khopoli and Odisha. The Odisha plant, which is close to the Kalinganagar plant of Tata Steel, is expected to generate synergy benefits due to consolidation of its position in the east.
In addition to synergy due to the close location of the plants, Bhushan has an iron ore (key raw material) mine in Sundergarh, Odisha, which has a reserve of 92 million tonnes per annum. This will add to Tata Steel’s existing captive mines of iron ore at Jharkhand and Odisha and reduce the vulnerability of price movement of iron ore in the market.
Also, Bhushan Steel, which is mainly into the production and supply of flat steel products, has been a long-term supplier to renowned manufacturers in the automobile sector such as Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Honda Cars, Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland. This acquisition will complement the focus of Tata Steel on the automobile segment.
Tata Steel could also benefit from the location of Bhushan Steel’s plants at Mera Mandali and Khopoli, which are near major international seaports, Paradeep and Nhava Sheva JNPT, respectively. The plant at Khopoli, due to its proximity to the west coast of India, and the plant at Meramandali close to the East coast, would enable the company to capture the export market in African, West Asian, South-East Asian and Australian markets. This would allow Tata Steel to ship its products to the international markets with minimal inland transportation ,which reduces overall freight charges and time."
175,2018-03-09,Tata Steel,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI tumbled about 6 per cent last week, breaking below the key support level of ₹325. The sharp fall over the last two weeks has turned the short-term outlook bearish for SBI. Immediate resistance is between ₹314 and ₹316. Inability to bounce above ₹316 from the current levels will increase the likelihood of the stock breaking below the support at ₹309. Such a break will intensify the selling pressure on the back of profit-booking and take it lower to ₹297. Further break below ₹297 can drag the stock to ₹290. But, if the stock sustains above ₹309 and breaks above ₹316, the downside pressure can ease. In that case, a relief rally to ₹325 or ₹328 is possible. Strong resistance is in the ₹325-₹328 region, which is likely to cap the upside in the short term as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels. Traders with high-risk appetite can go short on rallies at ₹315 and at ₹325. Stop-loss can be placed ₹335 for the target of ₹292. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹305 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹299.
ITC reversed lower last week failing to sustain the bounce-back move seen last week. The 21-day moving average resistance at ₹259 has restricted the upside in the stock all through the week. The stock made a high of ₹260.7 and has reversed lower from there to close about 2 per cent lower for the week. The pull-back move last week increases the possibility of the stock breaking below the immediate support level of ₹253.5 (100-week moving average) in the coming days. Such a break can take the stock lower to ₹249. A break below ₹249 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹245 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement support level. But, if it manages to bounce from ₹253.5, it can go up further to ₹259. The downside pressure will ease only if ITC breaks above ₹259. The next target is ₹262. But a break above ₹259 is less likely. Traders can go short on rallies at ₹258. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹261 for the target of ₹250. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹256 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹254.
Infosys failed to sustain above the psychological ₹1,000 mark and tumbled 5 per cent last week. The downward reversal in the past week indicates the absence of fresh buyers to take the stock strongly above ₹1,000. It has also turned the near-term outlook negative for the stock. Key resistance in the ₹975-980 zone can cap the upside in the near term. The possibility of the stock falling to ₹943 in the coming days is high. Further break below ₹943 will increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹933, ₹929 or even ₹923. Cluster of supports is poised in the broad ₹933-₹923 region. This leaves the possibility of the stock falling further below ₹923. An eventual upward reversal from the ₹933-₹923 support region can take Infosys higher to ₹960 and ₹970 level again. Short-term traders can buy on dips at ₹930. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹905 for the target of ₹980. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹940 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹950. Long-term investors can hold the stock and accumulate if it falls to ₹920.
RIL snapped its two-week rally and tumbled 4.2 per cent last week. Immediate support is at ₹905. If the stock manages to reverse higher from this support, a bounce to ₹930 or ₹935 is possible. Further break above ₹935 can take the stock higher to ₹959 again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹905 and ₹960 can be seen for some time. However, the bias is negative on the chart, indicating lower possibility of RIL reversing higher from ₹905. As such, a break below ₹905 can drag the stock lower to ₹885 or ₹880 in the coming days. This fall will form a double-top reversal pattern on the charts. So, the price action around ₹880 will need a close watch. If RIL manages to bounce from ₹880, the downside pressure can ease. A rally to ₹920 and 950 levels can be seen again. But if the stock breaks below ₹880 decisively, it will confirm the reversal pattern. In such a scenario, the stock can fall to ₹845. Further break below ₹845 will increase the likelihood of the downmove extending to ₹830 or even ₹800.
After hovering around ₹700 for three weeks, Tata Steel fell sharply in the past week. The stock was down 3.8 per cent for the week. Immediate support is at ₹676. A break below it can take the stock lower to ₹668. The level of ₹668 is a key short-term support. If the stock manages to reverse higher from there, a rally to ₹700 or even ₹715 is possible. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹715 is needed for the stock to gain fresh momentum. Such a break can take the stock further higher to ₹730 and ₹740 levels again. On the other hand, if Tata Steel beaks below ₹668 decisively, it can come under fresh selling pressure. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock falling to test the 100-day moving average support at ₹653. The region around ₹650 is a crucial support for the stock. Whether the stock manages to bounce higher from there or not will determine the next trend. At the moment, a strong break below ₹650 looks less probable.

Infosys to test a key resistance


The upmove in Infosys is gaining momentum. The stock rose for the second consecutive week and closed 2.2 per cent higher in the past week. Immediate support is at ₹1,016. As long as the stock stays above this support, a rise to test the crucial resistance region of ₹1,030-₹1,035 is likely in the coming days. Whether Infosys breaks above ₹1,035 will be key in determining the next move.
Inability to break above ₹1,035 and a subsequent pull-back move can take the stock lower to ₹1,015, ₹1,000 or even ₹990 thereafter. In such a scenario, the broad ₹900-₹1,035 sideways range may remain intact. But if the stock breaks and closes decisively above ₹1,035, it will be the first sign indicating that the downtrend that has been in place since June 2016 has ended. The stock can then test ₹1,050 initially. A break above ₹1,050 can take it higher to ₹1,070. A fresh rally to ₹1,070 will confirm the trend reversal. In that case Infosys will all be set to target ₹1,200 and ₹1,250 levels again over the medium term. Investors can hold the long positions.


Near-term outlook is positive for ITC


ITC failed to sustain higher after opening the week with a gap-up and making a high of ₹267.4 last Monday. Though the stock reversed downwards to touch a low of ₹257.6 on Wednesday, it managed to claw back and close 1.2 per cent higher for the week. The 21-day moving average support at ₹258 halted the fall last week. The near-term outlook is positive. Immediate resistance at ₹269 – the 100-day moving average – is likely to be tested in the near term. A strong break and a decisive close above this hurdle can take ITC higher to ₹272 and ₹276 thereafter. Such an upmove will also give an initial sign that the downtrend that has been in place since July has ended. A decisive weekly close above ₹276 will confirm the same. On the other hand, if the stock fails to break above ₹269 in the coming days and reverses lower, it can fall to ₹264 initially. Further break below ₹264 will increase the likelihood of the pull-back move extending to ₹261 thereafter. The region between ₹261 and ₹259 is a key support zone which is likely to limit the downside.


Immediate outlook is unclear for RIL


RIL was stuck in a narrow range between ₹908 and ₹933 in the past week. The stock has been moving in a sideways range since the beginning of the month and is seeking direction. This leaves the immediate outlook unclear. Support is at ₹900 and resistance is at ₹940. A breakout on either side of these levels will decide the next movement leg for the stock. If it sustains above ₹900 and breaches ₹940 in the coming days, an upmove to ₹960 is possible. But if RIL breaks below ₹900 in the coming days, it can fall to ₹885 or ₹878 initially.
The level of ₹878 is a crucial short-term support. If RIL manages to bounce from there, a bounce-back move to ₹900 or ₹930 is possible thereafter. But if the stock breaks decisively below ₹878, it can come under more selling pressure. It will then increase the likelihood of the stock falling to ₹860 or even ₹845 thereafter.
Such a fall will confirm a double-top reversal pattern on the charts and will leave the stock in danger of tumbling to ₹800, or even lower, thereafter.


SBI is stuck in a sideways range


SBI was stuck inside a sideways range between ₹309 and ₹321 for the second consecutive week. The immediate outlook continues to remain unclear and there is no change in our view from last week. A breakout on either side of ₹309 or ₹321 will decide the next trend. If the stock manages to sustain above ₹309 and gains momentum to breach ₹321, the downside pressure can ease. Such a break can take it to ₹323 — the 21-day moving average resistance or ₹325 initially. Further break above ₹325 will increase the likelihood of the upmove extending to ₹335 or even ₹340 thereafter.
On the other hand, if SBI declines decisively below ₹309, it will come under more selling pressure. In such a scenario, there is a strong likelihood of the stock falling to ₹300 or ₹297 on the back of profit booking. Further break below ₹297 can drag the stock to ₹290 thereafter. Traders can hold the short positions taken at ₹315. Retain the stop-loss at ₹322 for the target of ₹292. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹310 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹305.
Tata Steel can resume its uptrend
Tata Steel fell initially in the past week. However, the stock managed to bounce back after making a low of ₹671 on Thursday and recovering most of the loss made during the week. The price action since November reflects a flag formation on the charts. This is a bullish continuation pattern. It indicates that the current uptrend is still intact and is likely to resume in the coming weeks. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹715 will confirm the pattern. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to test the crucial ₹740-₹750 resistance region. An eventual break above ₹750 will pave the way for the next targets of ₹850 and ₹900 over the long term. Investors with a medium-term perspective can go long at current levels. Accumulate longs on dips at ₹685 and ₹670. Keep the stop-loss at ₹585. The 21-week moving average at ₹667 and a trendline around ₹645 are key supports for the stock. The outlook will turn negative only if the stock declines below these supports, which looks less probable at the moment.

SBI (₹319.8)
SBI began the week on a volatile note and swung between ₹301 and ₹323 on the first trading day of the week. But that was short-lived and the stock stayed in a narrow range for the rest of the week. As long as it sustains above ₹315, the bias will remain positive for the stock to break above the immediate resistance at ₹325. Such a break will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹335 initially. Further break above ₹335 will increase the likelihood of the upmove extending to ₹347 or ₹350 thereafter. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go long and accumulate on dips at ₹315. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹304 for the target of ₹345. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹323 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹330. Cluster of supports are poised in between ₹315 and ₹310. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if SBI declines below ₹310 decisively. Such a break can push the stock lower towards ₹306 initially. A strong break below ₹306 will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling to ₹295 or even ₹290 thereafter.
ITC (₹263.3)
The stock of ITC fell over 2 per cent initially in the past week. However, it managed to reverse higher from the low of ₹259 and recoup almost all the loss. Immediate resistances are placed at ₹266 and ₹268 levels. Supports are at ₹261 and ₹260. ITC can remain range-bound in the band between ₹260 and ₹268 for some time. On the charts, the bias is bullish for the stock to break the range above ₹268 in the coming days. Such a break can boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹271 or ₹272 initially. Further break above ₹272 will then increase the likelihood of the stock’s rally extending to ₹277 in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if ITC declines below ₹260 in the coming days, it can fall to ₹257 or ₹256 initially. A strong break below ₹256 may increase the likelihood of the stock falling to ₹252 or ₹250 thereafter. Short-term traders with a high risk appetite can buy the stock on dips at ₹261 and accumulate at ₹258. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹254 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹270 levels.
Infosys (₹1,038.4)
The stock extended its upmove for the third consecutive week and has closed on a strong note — above the crucial resistance level of ₹1,035, thereby giving an initial sign that the downtrend that has been in place since June 2016 has ended. Immediate support is between ₹1,035 and ₹1,030. As long as the stock sustains above ₹1,030, there is a strong likelihood of it rallying to ₹1,050 and ₹1,070 in the coming days. Such a rally will confirm the trend reversal. Inability to break above ₹1,070 may trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹1,030. In such a scenario, fresh buyers may emerge at lower levels and limit the downside. An eventual break above ₹1,070 will pave way for ₹1,100 and even higher levels. It will also gear up the stock to target ₹1,350 levels over the long-term. The near-term view will turn negative only if Infosys declines below ₹1,000. In such a scenario, the stock can fall to ₹980 or ₹975 on the back of profit booking. But such a fall below ₹1,000 looks less likely at the moment. Investors can hold the long positions.
RIL (₹918.5)
The stock of Reliance Industries (RIL) spiked lower to make a low of ₹861.7 on last Monday. Though it bounced back immediately, it did not gain momentum to breach the 21-day moving average resistance at ₹923. RIL has to break above this 21-day moving average resistance decisively for the downside pressure to ease and also to gain strength to move higher. Such a break will pave the way for a fresh rally to ₹950 and ₹960. But if RIL stays under ₹923, it can continue to remain under pressure. A dip to test a key support at ₹900 is possible then. A break below ₹900 can take it lower to ₹880 — a crucial short-term support level. If the stock manages to reverse higher from there, it can test ₹900 and even higher levels thereafter. In such a scenario, a range bound move between ₹880 and ₹960 can be seen for some time. But if RIL declines below ₹880 decisively, it can fall to ₹845 levels. As mentioned last week, a sharp fall to ₹845 will confirm a double-top reversal pattern on the chart and will leave the stock in a danger of tumbling to ₹800 or even lower.
Tata Steel (₹710.6)
Tata Steel fell sharply to make a low of ₹675 initially in the past week. However, it reversed sharply higher thereafter to recover all the loss and close 2.3 per cent higher for the week. The stock has been getting strong support from the 21-week moving average over the last three weeks. The price action on the chart keeps the bias bullish for the stock. Key resistance is at ₹715, which is likely to be broken in the coming days. Such a break can boost the momentum and take it higher to ₹740 and ₹750, which are the next key resistances. Inability to break above ₹750 can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹720 or ₹715. However, an eventual break above ₹750 will then pave way for the long-term targets of ₹850 and ₹900. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions. Retain the stop-loss at ₹585. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if the stock declines below the support at ₹670. In such a scenario, the stock can fall to ₹660 and ₹650. But such a break and fall below ₹670 looks less probable at the moment.

166,2018-03-09,Tata Steel,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI fell over 3 per cent last week. The fall has dragged the stock well below the key support level of ₹315. A cluster of resistances in between ₹315 and ₹320 can cap the upside in the coming days. The price action last week has turned the short-term outlook bearish. Also, a complex head and shoulder reversal pattern on the daily chart increases the likelihood of the stock falling in the coming days. Traders holding long positions can book loss and exit at current levels. The stock can fall to ₹300 initially. A break below ₹300 can drag it further lower to ₹296 and ₹293 or even ₹290 thereafter. Traders with high risk appetite can go short at current levels and on rallies at ₹314. Keep the stop-loss at ₹317 for the target of ₹294.
Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹306 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹301. The downside pressure will ease only if the stock breaks above ₹315 decisively. Such a break can take it to ₹320 initially. However, the stock has to breach ₹320 for the outlook to turn positive.
ITC was stuck in a narrow range over the last few weeks. The stock has been in between the 21-day moving average support at ₹260 and the 100-day moving average resistance at ₹267 over the last three weeks. A breakout on either side of ₹260 or ₹267 will determine the next trend.
If ITC manages to surpass ₹267 decisively, it can move up to ₹272 initially. It will also be an initial sign that the downtrend that has been in place since July 2017 is being reversed. A further rally breaking above ₹272 can then target ₹277 or ₹280, confirming the trend reversal. On the other hand, if ITC remains below ₹267 and breaks below ₹260, it can fall to ₹257 — a key short-term support level. A strong break below ₹257 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹252 thereafter. Traders who have taken long positions on dips last week at ₹261 can hold it. Accumulate longs at ₹258. Retain the stop-loss at ₹254 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹270.
Infosys had a volatile 2017. At one point of time the stock had tumbled about 15 per cent. But it recovered all the losses and has gained 3 per cent in 2017. . This recovery rally, which has taken the stock above the crucial ₹1,030-₹1,035 resistance zone, is signalling a trend reversal and the worst seems to be over. Immediate support is in between ₹1,035 and ₹1,030 and then the next significant support is around ₹1,000. As long as the stock remains above ₹1,000, the outlook is positive. A rally to ₹1,070 is likely in the short term, which will confirm the trend reversal. It will pave the way for the stock to target ₹1,350 levels. Inability to break above ₹1,070 initially can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹1,050 and ₹1,035.
Investors can hold the long positions and accumulate on dips at ₹1,015. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if the stock declines below ₹1,000. Subsequent targets are ₹980 and ₹965. But such a fall below ₹1,000 is less likely as dips to ₹1,000 may find fresh buyers coming into the market.
RIL, which has surged a whopping 71 per cent in 2017, witnessed muted trading in the final week of the year. The stock managed to sustain above ₹900, but remained in a narrow range all through the week. Support is at ₹912 and immediate resistance is at ₹935. A breakout on either side of these levels will give a cue on the next trend. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹935 can take RIL higher to ₹960 — a crucial resistance that has been capping the upside since October. Inability to break above ₹960 can pull the stock lower to ₹935 or even further down. But a strong break above ₹960 can target the psychological ₹1,000 level.
On the other hand, if RIL breaks below ₹912 in the coming days, it can fall to ₹896 initially. A further break below ₹896 can drag it to ₹880 — a crucial short-term support level. As reiterated over the last couple of weeks, a strong break below ₹880 will indicate a double top pattern on the chart and can drag the stock to ₹854 or even lower thereafter.
Year 2017 was a robust one for Tata Steel. The stock surged a whopping 87 per cent last year. The strong 3 per cent rally last week has taken the stock well above a key resistance level of ₹715, which has been capping the upside over the last several weeks. This marks the end of the sideways consolidation and also the resumption of the overall uptrend. Resistance is at ₹743, which was tested last week.
A strong break and a decisive weekly close above this hurdle is needed for the stock to extend its rally. Such a break will boost the momentum for the stock to target ₹850 over the medium term. But if Tata Steel continues to remain below ₹743, it can dip to ₹715 or ₹710 in the coming days. An immediate break below ₹710 is unlikely at the moment. So, as long as the stock remains below ₹743, a range-bound move between ₹710 and ₹743 can be seen for some time. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions. Accumulate on dips at ₹720. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹615.

172,2018-03-09,Tata Steel,"Weekly Trading Guide
After falling for two consecutive weeks, SBI closed on a flat note last week. The stock was stuck in a narrow range between ₹309 and ₹321 in the past week. The immediate outlook is not clear. A breakout on either side of ₹309 or ₹321 will decide the next move. A strong break above ₹321 will ease the downside pressure and can take the stock higher to ₹327 — the 21-day moving average resistance initially. Further break above ₹327 level will increase the likelihood of the stock’s up move extending to ₹335 or even to ₹340 thereafter. On the other hand, if SBI breaks and closes decisively below ₹309, it will come under selling pressure. In such a scenario, the possibility of the stock falling to ₹300 or ₹297 on the back of profit booking will be high. Further break below ₹297 can drag the stock to ₹290 thereafter. Traders can hold the short positions taken at ₹315. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹322 for the target of ₹292. Move the stop-loss lower to ₹305 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹299.
ITC fell as expected in the past week breaking below the support at ₹253.5. However, this down move did not sustain. The stock reversed sharply recovering all the losses from its low of ₹250.5 on Thursday and close 2.5 per cent higher. The short positions recommended last week has been stopped out during this sudden reversal. The strong upward reversal last week has taken the stock well above the 21-day moving average resistance, which was capping the upside since November. Also, the strong bounce last week is technically significant as it has happened from a key long-term trend-line support level of ₹249. Immediate resistance is at ₹264, which is likely to be tested in the coming days. If ITC manages to surpass this hurdle, the downside pressure will ease. A rise to test ₹269 or ₹271 — the key 21-week moving average resistance is possible. But if the stock reverses lower from ₹264, it can fall to ₹260 or ₹257. Such a pull-back move will keep the stock in range bound between ₹250 and ₹264 for a while.
Contrary to expectation, Infosys surged 4.5 per cent last week. The 55-day moving average, which is about to cross 100-day moving average suggests that the downside could be limited and leaves near-term view positive. The current upmove can extend to ₹1,020. A break above ₹1,020 can take it to ₹1,030 and ₹1,035. The region between ₹1,030 and ₹1,035 is a crucial resistance. A strong weekly close above ₹1,035 will signal the reversal of the long-term downtrend that has been in place since June 2016. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹1,200 or ₹1,300 over the long term. But if Infosys reverses lower from ₹1,020 or from the ₹1,030-₹1,035 region, it can fall to ₹1,000 or ₹975. In such a scenario, the prolonged sideways range between ₹900 and ₹1,035 that has been in place since November 2016 will remain intact. So, a subsequent fall below ₹975 will then increase the possibility of the stock falling to ₹950 or ₹900. Investors can hold long positions.
RIL reversed higher in the past week after making a low of ₹895.9 on Tuesday. The stock closed 1.2 per cent higher for the week. The weekly candlestick reflects indecisiveness in the market. Resistance is at ₹937 and support is at ₹918 — the 21-day moving average. A breakout on either side of these levels will decide the next move. If RIL declines below ₹918, it can fall to ₹905. Further break below ₹905 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹893 or ₹882. As mentioned last week, a fall to ₹882 will form a double-top reversal pattern on the chart. A decisive break below ₹882 will confirm the pattern and increase the possibility of the stock falling to ₹845. Further break below ₹845 can drag it to ₹830 or even to ₹800. On the other hand, if RIL manages to break above ₹937 in the coming days, the downside pressure will ease. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹959 and ₹961. The region between ₹959 and ₹961 is a crucial resistance, which has to be broken to target ₹1,000.
Tata Steel tumbled about 3 per cent in the initial part of the week and made a low of ₹660.6. However, the stock managed to reverse sharply from this low and close 2.4 per cent higher for the week. Support is at ₹684, which is likely to limit the downside in the near term. A rise to test the resistance at ₹715 is likely in the coming days. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹715 will boost the momentum. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹740 in the short term. On the other hand, if Tata Steel reverses lower from ₹715, it can fall to ₹690 or ₹684 again. Such a pull-back move will increase the likelihood of the stock breaking below ₹684 and revisit ₹670 and ₹660 levels. If the stock breaks below ₹660, the down move can extend to ₹650. The 21-week moving average at ₹660 and a trend-line support at ₹650 are the key supports for the stock. A sharp fall breaking below ₹650 is less likely. Fresh buying interest may emerge in the ₹660-₹650 region.

SBI (₹253.1)
 As expected, SBI fell breaking below the 200-week moving average (₹260) support last week. The stock tumbled to a low of ₹244.4, but managed to recover some of the loss before closing 3.6 per cent lower for the week. The crucial support at ₹245 is holding well as of now. Since the stock has been falling continuously over the last few weeks, as long as it sustains above ₹245, a corrective rally in the short term cannot be ruled out. A strong break above the immediate resistance in the ₹258-₹260 zone can trigger this corrective rally, targeting ₹270 in the short term on the back of profit booking. But if SBI fails to breach ₹260 and remains below it, a revisit of ₹245 is possible. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹245 and ₹260 can be seen for some time. The stock will come under renewed pressure if it breaks below ₹245 decisively. Such a break can take it to ₹238 initially. Further break below ₹238 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹205 or ₹200 over the medium term.
 








 
 
ITC (₹259.4)
ITC fell breaking below the key support level of ₹262 last week. Though the stock has bounced from its intra-week low of ₹253.4, the muted price action of this recovery move indicates lack of strength. Strong resistance is in the ₹263-₹266 region. ITC should surpass ₹266 decisively to ease the downside pressure. In such a scenario, the stock can rally to ₹270 and ₹275 again. But the indicators on the chart suggest a lower possibility of the stock breaking above the ₹263-₹266 resistance zone. Immediate support is at ₹257. A strong break below it can drag the stock lower to ₹250 in the coming days. A break below ₹250 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending towards ₹244. Further fall below ₹244 looks less probable at the moment. Short-term traders can go short on rallies at ₹262 and ₹265 with a stop-loss at ₹268 for the target of ₹252. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹259 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹256. Long-term investors, on the other hand can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220.
Infosys (₹1,163.4)
Though, Infosys is stuck in a sideways range for more than two weeks the price action keeps the bias positive. Inability to break above ₹1,169 can keep the stock range-bound between ₹1,130 and ₹1,169 for some time. But a decisive break above ₹1,169 can boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹1,200 initially. It will also increase the possibility of the stock breaching the psychological ₹1,200 mark and targeting ₹1,250 or even higher levels over the medium term. The 21-day moving average at ₹1,138 and a trend line at ₹1,130 are the key supports to watch. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below ₹1,130 decisively. Such a break, though less likely, will increase the possibility of the stock falling towards ₹1,110 and ₹1,100 in the short term. The region between ₹1,100 and ₹1,085 is a strong support for Infosys. A strong fall breaking below ₹1,085 is unlikely as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at lower levels and limit the downside. Both long and medium-term investors can hold the long positions.
RIL (₹912) 
 RIL fell sharply last week after failing to extend its up-move beyond the key resistance at ₹960. The stock tumbled over 6 per cent intra-week and made a low of ₹888.3. However, it managed to bounce from this low recovering some of the loss and closed 3.7 per cent lower for the week. The broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range within which the stock has been trading over the last few months, remains intact. The immediate outlook is unclear. Cluster of moving average (21-, 100- and 55-day moving average) resistances are poised in between ₹922 and ₹928. If RIL manages to break above this resistance cluster, it can rally again towards ₹950 and ₹960 — the upper end of the range. But inability to break above the ₹922-₹928 resistance zone and a pull-back move in the coming days can keep the stock under pressure. In such a scenario, RIL can fall below ₹900 and test ₹880 and ₹870 — the lower end of the range. Traders can continue to stay out of this stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges.
Tata Steel (₹605.6)
Contrary to our expectation, Tata Steel tumbled breaking below ₹630 last week. The stock plummeted 10 per cent in the past week and the stop-loss levels on the long positions have been breached. The uptrend that has been in place since 2016 is under threat now and initial signs of a trend reversal are emanating on the charts. The stock has closed below the 200-day moving average for the first time in two years. Cluster of resistances in between ₹635 and ₹650 can cap the upside. Intermediate bounces may find fresh sellers coming into the market at higher levels in the above-mentioned resistance zone. As long as the stock remains below ₹650, the outlook will remain bearish and a fall to ₹580 cannot be ruled out. A strong break below ₹580 will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹555. Short-term traders can go short on rallies at ₹630 and ₹650. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹685 for the target of ₹560. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹605 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹585."
140,2018-03-19,Tata Steel,"Consider objections to Tata Steel bids: NCLT to Bhushan Steel creditors 
 The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) today asked the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of debt-ridden Bhushan Steel to consider the objections raised by its employees over the bids submitted by Tata Steel. The CoC, which is scheduled to meet tomorrow to take up the resolution plan of the highest bidder Tata Steel, would consider the objections raised by the employees.
The tribunal has also directed the insolvency resolution professional (IRP) to report the decision on the objections of the employees. “Objections filed by the applicants would be forwarded to CoC for consideration. Any decision taken would be communicated to NCLT at the time of submission of the final resolution plan,” said NCLT President Justice M M Kumar.
During the proceedings, senior advocate AS Chandhiok appearing for the employees submitted before the bench that Tata Steel is an ‘undischarged insolvent’ and is not entitled under Section 29 A of the IBC Code. Senior advocate Rajiv Nayyar, appearing for Tata Steel, opposed Bhushan employees’ application questioning their locus on the matter. However, the NCLT refused, stating that it is “not inclined to accept” Tata Steel’s objection at this stage.
On March 7, Tata Steel had said it had been identified as the highest resolution applicant to acquire controlling stake of Bhushan Steel, which was undergoing insolvency proceeding."

Tata Steel committing ₹45,400 crore for Bhushan Steel—first of the 12 big defaulters on the RBI’s list to be referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for insolvency under IBC—has meant minimal haircut for lenders. But the deal may leave minority shareholders in the lurch, if the resolution plan under Alchemist Asset Reconstruction Company Limited vs Hotel Gaudavan Pvt. Ltd, the first under IBC in December 2017, is any indication. A steep reduction in capital as part of the resolution plan and fresh infusion of capital by the new investor can hurt minority shareholders—leaving nothing on the table for them.
In the Hotel Gaudavan case, for instance, the NCLT approved the acquisition of the Rajasthan-based hotel by a non-banking finance company—JFC Finance (India)—without any haircuts to creditors. But the approved resolution plan included reduction of the existing capital from ₹100 to ₹1 per share. JFC would pay existing shareholders ₹1 per share or ₹17.38 lakh.
“Hence, in this particular case, the resolution applicant (the new investor) has provided for reduction in the paid-up capital of the company from ₹17.38 crore to ₹17.38 lakh,” explains KS Ravichandran, Managing Partner, KSR & Co, Company Secretaries LLP.
“In IBC cases, dilution happens in two ways. One, the resolution plan itself entails a reduction in capital. In certain cases like Murli Industries, which was bought over by Dalmia Bharat for about ₹400 crore, aside from the large haircut of over 70-odd per cent that the lenders took, there was also a huge write down of equity after conversion of unsustainable debt into equity after which the converted equity was bought at a deep discount,” says Siby Antony, Chairman, Edelweiss ARC.
A further infusion of capital by Dalmia Bharat to hold a chunk of the stake in the company reduced the stake of minority shareholders to minimum.
Edelweiss ARC had acquired 65 per cent of Murli Industries’ debt from eight banks.
Unclear provisions
According to KS Ravichandran, given that the new investor is settling dues to the lenders of the corporate debtor (with minimal haircuts in some cases) and also pumping in fresh money into the company, the steep reduction in existing capital is only expected.
“What is of more concern is the fact that the IBC in its current form, is somewhat unclear on the provisions relating to either the procedure of allotment of shares to the new investor, writedown of the existing capital or even whether the resolution applicant will need existing shareholders approval to become owners in the corporate debtor,” says KS Ravichandran.
After all, it would be absurd if the new investor, after emerging the highest bidder and willing to pay off lenders, and infuse fresh capital into the company, is denied ownership in the company due to lack of shareholders’ approval.
In the case of Bhushan Steel, the equity or networth (as of March 2017) was already negative owing to accumulated losses. According to shareholding pattern as of December 2017, public holding in Bhushan Steel is around 42 per cent, of which 15 per cent or 3.4 crore shares are held by individuals having share capital up to ₹2 lakh.
The fate of these minority shareholders is unclear as of now, as the contours of the resolution are yet to be disclosed.
Among the IBC cases, many of the corporate defaulters are listed companies-- Monnet Ispat & Energy, KS Oils, Ennore Coke, Educomp Solutions, Gujarat NRE Coke, Unity Infraprojects, Clutch Auto to name a few. Most of these stocks have already been beaten down by the market."

   -  REUTERS


Tata Steel’s bid to acquire Bhushan Steel has gained pace, with lenders giving the deal their assent. The Tata group company has agreed to pay about ₹35,000 crore to the creditors of Bhushan Steel, which had defaulted on loans worth ₹44,480 crore. 
 Tata Steel accepted the Letter of Intent for Bhushan Steel on Thursday, under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, it said in a statement on Friday. However, there are still some hurdles it has to cross before completing the acquisition. 
For starters, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has filed an application before the NCLT seeking to be reclassified as a ‘secured’ rather than as an ‘operational creditor’ under the IBC, so that it gets priority in recovering ₹900 crore for supplying capital goods. 
L&T had bagged a ₹1,205-crore order from Bhushan Steel to construct the latter’s plant in Odisha in September 2007, but its dues were not paid fully though the work was completed.
If the NCLT accepts L&T’s plea then the banks will have to take a bigger haircut and if the plea is rejected, L&T may move the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal to protect its interest.
Employee objections ignored
The employees of Bhushan Steel had also moved the NCLT objecting to the eligibility of Tata Steel under Section 29 of the IBC. Following this, the NCLT had directed the Committee of Creditors to consider the employees’ objections. But with the committee officially announcing Tata Steel as the highest bidder, it seems the employees’ objections have been set aside. 
The NCLT will now take the final call on the Tata Steel bid. 
Interestingly, the extended resolution period for Bhushan Steel ends on April 22. The company’s insolvency resolution process plea was admitted by the NCLT on July 26 and the initial mandate of 180 days ended in December 2017.
If Tata Steel’s bid gets through the NCLT approval process, it will be a major confidence builder for public sector banks, which are struggling to recover loans extended to the highly-leveraged steel sector. Tata Steel’s hefty bid will imply a minimal haircut for Bhushan Steel’s lenders. 
But for Tata Steel, this could mean that its overall debt rises further. 
The company had a gross debt of ₹88,000 crore as of the December quarter and it could cross the ₹1 lakh crore mark in the next two-three years."

SBI is vulnerable for further fall (₹234.6)
The ongoing scams and frauds in the banking sector is keeping stocks in this space under pressure. SBI tumbled about 7 per cent breaking below the crucial support level of ₹241. The fall last week indicates that the downtrend is intact and is gaining strength. Key resistances are at ₹241 and ₹250, which can cap the upside in the short term. A fall to ₹226 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement support level is likely in the short-term. A bounce back-move to ₹241 from ₹226 cannot be ruled out. However, the upside is expected to be capped as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels and cap the upside. An eventual break below ₹226 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or 190 over the medium term. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go short at current levels and at ₹240. Keep the stop-loss at ₹248 for the target of ₹205. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹232 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹227. The downside pressure will ease only if SBI breaches ₹250 decisive. But that looks unlikely in the near term.
Short-term view is negative for ITC (₹256.3)
Weakness in the broader markets dragged ITC below the key support level of ₹258 in the final trading session of the week. The ₹258-₹259 resistance region can cap the upside in the near term. As long as the stock trades below ₹259, a fall to ₹251 or ₹250 is likely. Short-term traders can go short at the current levels and at ₹258. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹259.5 for the target of ₹251. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹255 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹253. A bounce-back thereafter from ₹250 can ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹257 or ₹258 again. But if ITC declines below ₹250 decisively, the downmove can then extend to ₹247 or ₹244 over the medium term. But such a fall will be a good buying opportunity for the medium and long-term investors. Cluster of supports are poised between ₹245 and ₹230, which can halt the downtrend. A strong upward reversal thereafter will mark the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend. Long-term investors can hold the long positions and accumulate at ₹247. Retain the stop-loss at ₹220.
Infosys consolidated within its uptrend (₹1,167.4)
The ₹1,140-₹1,130 region continues to provide strong support for Infosys. The stock made a low of ₹1,140 and has reversed higher from there. The ₹1,130-₹1,200 sideways range remains intact. Intermediate resistance is at ₹1,177. A break above it can take Infosys higher to ₹1,200. Inability to break above ₹1,200 can pull the stock lower and continue to keep it in the ₹1,130-₹1,200 range. A strong break above ₹1,200 is needed for Infosys to gain fresh momentum. Such a break can take it higher to ₹1,210. Further break above ₹1,210 will see the stock rallying to ₹1,250 and even higher thereafter. On the other hand, Infosys will come under pressure if it breaks below ₹1,130. Such a break will see an intermediate dip to ₹1,100. Further fall below ₹1,100 is less probable as fresh buyers may emerge at lower levels. Also, the overall bias is bullish for Infosys to breach ₹1,200 and extend its upmove over a medium and long term. So any intermediate fall below ₹1,130 will be a good buying opportunity. Both medium- and long-term investors can hold the long positions.
Immediate outlook is unclear for RIL (₹892.8)
RIL was stuck in a narrow range in the past week. The stock was range-bound between ₹887 and ₹911 and has closed on a slightly negative note. The immediate outlook is unclear. Traders can stay out of the stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges. As long as the stock remains below ₹900, a fall to test the crucial support at ₹870 is likely. A break below ₹870 can drag RIL to ₹860 and ₹850 thereafter. But if the stock manages to sustain above the support at ₹870 and reverses higher, the downside pressure will ease. Such a reversal will indicate that the broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range is intact. The stock has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time since last November. Intermediate resistance is at ₹900 and cluster of resistances are poised between ₹920 and ₹930. A strong break above ₹930 will pave way for a fresh rally to ₹960. RIL will gain fresh bullish momentum only if it breaks above ₹960 decisively. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹1,000 or even higher thereafter.
Downtrend intact for Tata Steel (₹566.6)
As expected, Tata Steel extended its fall for the third consecutive week. The stock was down 5.6 per cent last week. Tata Steel has tumbled 16 per cent over the last three weeks. Immediate support is at ₹550. But the stock is vulnerable to break below this level in the coming days as the downtrend has gathered momentum and any upmove would find fresh selling interest coming into the stock. Such a break can drag it to ₹540 or ₹530. The region between ₹540-₹530 is a strong medium-term support. Since the stock has been falling continuously over the last few weeks, a relief rally from the ₹540-₹530 support zone cannot be ruled out. An upward reversal from this support zone can take the stock higher to ₹585 or even ₹600. But if Tata Steel breaks below ₹530 decisively, it can tumble to ₹500 or even ₹480 over the medium term. Traders can hold the short positions. Revise the stop-loss lower to the level of ₹585. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹575 as soon as the stock dips to ₹555. Book profits at ₹545."

CLIx has helped improve the education outcomes in a total of 478 government schools, covering 32,437 students in the States of Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Rajasthan and Telangana




CLIx has helped improve the education outcomes in a total of 478 government schools, covering 32,437 students in the States of Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Rajasthan and Telangana


 
Robert Lalngaihawna, a high school mathematics teacher at the Government Hrangchhuana High School in a small village near Mizoram’s Aizawl city had been struggling to teach complex concepts to his students who come from nearby villages with almost half of them failing exams each year.
But now thanks to the new tripartite initiative ‘Connected Learning Initiative (CLIx)’ of Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Tata Trusts, 95 per cent of Lalngaihawna’s students are able to clear the math exams.
Graphic-based learning
Modelled around MIT’s EdX platform, CLIx brings together the concepts of Massive Open Online Courses (MooC) to primary education, wherein teachers can use graphics-based digital techniques to explain the most complex of topics in the simplest of ways.
“We saw how successful MIT’s EdX model was at the undergraduate level. That got us thinking about how we can apply the learnings in the Indian context at high school level,” Padma Sarangapani, Project Director, CLIx and Professor, TISS, told BusinessLine while talking about the inception of the CLIx initiative, which recently won UNESCO’s prestigious King Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa Prize, an international recognition for the use of Information and Communication Technologies in the field of Education.
“We studied the ecosystem and realised that while there are offerings for digital learning, there was nothing available in Indian languages at the high school level. Moreover, there were not many programmes for teacher education,” Sarangapani said.
By 2015, the three institutions together initiated the curriculum development and setup the team. While MIT helped build capacity for the Indian team, which meant getting the technology right to build an EdX kind of platform for students and teachers at school level. TISS also brought in a pool of people with different skill sets including Indian language expertise.
“We tried avoiding the idea of converting existing text books into e-textbooks. We’ve stayed away from such applications. We picked up, in consultation with teachers, concepts in Maths and Science that are difficult to understand for students,” Sarangapani said.
Four pronged approach
Several math modules created are now game-based. These games encourage students to deduce solutions and arrive at the answer, thereby helping improve learning rate.
With a four pronged approach that includes Classroom Activities, Lab Activities, IT enabled Activities and Review and Assessment to deliver learning outcomes, CLIx aims to provide high quality learning experiences in Hindi, Telugu and English. CLIx has helped improve the education outcomes in a total of 478 government secondary schools; covering 2,130 teachers and 32,437 students in the States of Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Rajasthan and Telangana.
Currently, CLIx is being offered in over 15 modules in Mathematics, Science, English and Digital Literacy in three languages in these schools in which ICT labs have been activated. About 1,770 teachers have participated in Teacher Professional Development workshops and are on mobile-phone enabled Communities.
And the results are speaking for themselves. In Lalngaihawna’s class, recent tests show that 95 per cent students have been able to clear the math exams while less than 60 per cent could do that just last year before the CLIx programme was introduced for class 9 students. “I find the different applications (within CLIx) very useful in my teachings. At first, the students were hesitating to use the computers as most of them are from the rural areas who do not have computer system at their homes. After 2 to 3 classes, they catch up with the system and their progress was fast beyond imagination,” Lalngaihawna said.
TISSx platform
While CLIx is currently open only for select schools, TISS is planning to open it up completely within the next few months so that any school teacher or students across the country can get access to the digital classroom. Once opened to everyone, the platform will be called TISSx.
“TISSx platform will be open to anyone who wants to access it. Moreover, Ministry of HRD is in the process of setting up teacher developer platform called Diksha. One of the first few teacher professional courses to be offered on Diksha will be CLIx."

Near-term outlook is unclear for SBI (₹250.1)
Contrary to expectations of a fall, SBI witnessed a sharp bounce in the past week. The near-term outlook is unclear. The price action will be key in deciding the next move. Key resistance is in the ₹257-260 region. If SBI manages to breach ₹260 decisively, the downside pressure will ease. Such a break will trigger a relief rally towards ₹271 — a 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level — initially on the back of short covering. Further break above ₹271 will see the up-move extending towards ₹283 — a trendline as well as the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance level. A rally beyond ₹283 is unlikely as the upside is expected to be capped at this level. SBI will come under pressure again only if it breaks below ₹240 decisively. Such a break will bring the bears back into the stock. It will signal the resumption of the overall downtrend and increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹200 and ₹190 over the medium term. Traders can stay out of the stock and wait for a clear trend and a trade signal to emerge.
ITC can remain range bound (₹255.9)
ITC was volatile in the past week. Though it opened with a wide gap-down, it managed to reverse sharply higher closing the gap and surged to a high of ₹265.75 on the same day. However, ITC failed to sustain and came off from this high again, giving back most of the gains made during the week. It closed on a flat note. A dip to revisit the crucial support at ₹250 is likely in the near term. If the stock manages to bounce again from ₹250, it can move higher and remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. But if ITC declines below ₹250 decisively, a fresh fall to ₹247 or ₹244 is possible. As mentioned last week, a cluster of supports poised between ₹245 and ₹230 can halt the current downtrend. A strong upward reversal thereafter will mark the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend. So, investors holding the long positions can accumulate at ₹247 and retain the stop-loss at ₹220. A strong break above ₹265 will bring fresh bullish momentum and take ITC higher to ₹270 and ₹275 thereafter.
Short-term view is negative for Infosys (₹1,134.4)
Infosys tumbled 2.8 per cent last week. The short-term outlook has turned negative after last week’s strong fall. Immediate resistances are at ₹1,140 and ₹1,145. A break above ₹1,145 can ease the downside pressure and take the stock up to ₹1,160. Further break above ₹1,160 will increase the possibility of the stock revisiting ₹1,200 levels. If Infosys remains below ₹1,145, it can be under pressure. While below ₹1,145, a fall to ₹1,090 or ₹1,085 is likely in the short term. Further fall below ₹1,085 is less probable now. But if Infosys breaks below ₹1,085, it will indicate a double-top formation on the chart. This will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹1,050 or even ₹1,030 over the medium term. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go short at current levels. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,165 for the target of ₹1,085. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹1,120 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹1,110. However, the fall to ₹1,050-₹1,030 will be a good buying opportunity for long-term investors.
RIL hovers above a crucial support (₹882.8)
RIL seems to lack strength to breach the psychological level of ₹900. The stock made a high of ₹910 only to close 1.1 per cent lower for the week. A crucial support is at ₹870, which is likely to be tested. If RIL manages to bounce from there, the downside pressure will ease. It will keep the broader ₹870-960 sideways range intact and increase the possibility of the stock bouncing back to ₹900 and ₹920 initially. Further break above ₹920 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹960 — the upper end of the range in the short term. On the other hand, if RIL breaks below ₹870, it can fall to ₹860 or ₹855. A trend line as well as the 200-day moving average supports are poised between ₹860 and ₹855. A strong break below ₹855 will bring renewed pressure for the stock. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹820 or even ₹800 on the back of profit-booking. This down move below ₹855 could be swift as stop-loss orders are likely to be triggered below this level.
Tata Steel can consolidate sideways (₹570.9)
Tata Steel managed to sustain above the key support level of ₹550 last week. However, the price action on the chart reflects that the stock lacks strong buying interest. It made a high of ₹598.85 and has come off from it. A revisit to ₹550 is likely in the near term. A bounce from ₹550 can take it back to ₹600 again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹550 and ₹600 can be seen for some time. If Tata Steel manages to breach ₹600, the downside pressure can ease and a rally to ₹635 is possible. Further break above ₹635 looks unlikely at the moment as the bias continues to remain bearish. As such, an eventual break below ₹550 can take Tata Steel lower to ₹535. A strong break below ₹535 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or ₹500 over the medium term. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go short. Keep the stop-loss at ₹605 for the target of ₹515. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹555 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹545."

SBI forms a bullish reversal pattern (₹259.8)
After an initial struggle, SBI managed to breach decisively the 21-day moving average (₹250) resistance towards the end of the week. The stock was up 3.8 per cent last week and has closed on a strong note. The level of ₹250 will now be a good support for the stock. The price action on the chart since March indicates the formation of an inverted head and shoulder pattern. This is a bullish reversal pattern. The neckline resistance of this pattern is at ₹262. A strong break above ₹262 will confirm this pattern and take SBI higher to ₹268 initially. Further break above ₹268 will pave way for the next targets of ₹275 and ₹280. On the other hand, if SBI fails to rise past ₹262 in the coming days, it can fall back towards ₹250 levels again. A break below ₹250 can then drag the stock lower to ₹240 levels again. Traders can go long on a break above ₹262. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹252 for the target of ₹280. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹268.
Near-term view is positive for ITC (₹260.6)
ITC remained broadly in a sideways range all through last week. The near-term view is positive. A rise to test the ₹264-₹266 resistance region is possible in the coming days. Whether ITC breaks above ₹266 or not will be key in deciding the next move. A strong break above ₹266 will bring renewed strength to the stock. Such a break can then trigger a fresh rally to ₹274. The rally to ₹274 will also mark the end of the downtrend that has been in place since February. On the other hand, if ITC fails to breach ₹266 and reverses lower in the coming days, it can fall to ₹260 or ₹257 again. The region between ₹257 and ₹255 is a key near-term support. A bounce from this support zone can take the stock ITC higher again and keep it range-bound between ₹255 and ₹266 for some time. But if ITC declines below ₹255, it can fall to test the crucial support level of ₹250. A break below it can drag it to ₹250. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at the level of ₹220.
Short-term outlook is negative for Infosys (₹1,129.3)
Infosys remained subdued and range-bound between ₹1,120 and ₹1,150. Key resistances are at ₹1,147 and ₹1,155. As long as the stock remains below these resistances, a fall to ₹1,090 cannot be ruled out. A bounce from ₹1,090 will ease the pressure and take Infosys higher to ₹1,150 levels again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range bound between ₹1,090 and ₹1,200 for sometime. But if Infosys breaks below ₹1,090, a fall to ₹1,050 or even ₹1,030 is possible over the medium-term. But further fall below the ₹1,050-₹1,030 support zone is unlikely as fresh buyers can emerge in the market. As mentioned last week, a fall to ₹1,050-₹1,030, if seen, will be a good buying opportunity for long-term investors. Traders who have taken short positions last week can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,165 for a revised target of ₹1,105. Move the stop-loss lower to ₹1,125 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹1,115. Medium and long-term investors can hold the long positions.
Near-term view is positive for RIL (₹909.7)
RIL snapped its four-week fall. The stock surged 2.8 per cent last week. Key resistances are at ₹921 and ₹928, which are likely to be tested in the near term. Inability to breach these hurdles can pull the stock lower to ₹900 or ₹890 levels again. But if RIL manages to breach ₹928 decisively, it can gain momentum. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹960 over the short term. A strong break above ₹928 will boost the momentum. Such a break can take RIL higher to ₹960 in the short term. The level of ₹960 is a crucial resistance for RIL. A strong break above it will pave way for the next targets of ₹1,000 and ₹1,020 over the medium. But if RIL reverses lower from ₹960, it can fall back to ₹920 or ₹900 levels again. In such a scenario, the broader ₹870-₹960 range will remain intact. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go long at current levels. Keep the stop-loss at ₹885 for the target of ₹955. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹920 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹935.
Resistance to cap the upside in Tata Steel (₹586.3)
Tata Steel remained lower but in a narrow range in the past week. The stock has been consolidating over the last couple of weeks within its overall downtrend. The level of ₹600 is a key near-term resistance. A strong break above it is needed for the downside pressure to ease. Such a break can trigger a corrective rally towards ₹630. But the upside is expected to be capped as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels. As such, a further rally beyond ₹630 looks less probable now as the bias continues to remain bearish on the stock. A revisit of ₹550 is likely in the coming days. A break below ₹550 can take the stock lower to ₹535 initially. Further break below ₹535 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or even ₹500 over the medium term. Traders who have taken short positions can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹605 for the target of ₹515. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹555 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹545.

A steel joint venture between Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel will be delayed by ongoing talks between the Indian group and its British and Dutch workers, the German company said on Thursday.
Unlike Thyssenkrupp, Tata Steel has yet to reach labour agreements at its Port Talbot plant in Britain and IJmuiden in the Netherlands, a key condition for a deal aimed at cutting overcapacity in the sector.
The groups agreed in principle in September to combine their European steel activities to create the continent's second-largest steelmaker, behind ArcelorMittal.
Boards at both companies are expected to decide on the 50:50 venture by the end of June, Thyssenkrupp said, with the official signing now planned to take place afterwards. The groups had previously aimed to sign the deal in the beginning of 2018.
The German company did not say when the deal, which had been expected to close the end of 2018, would be concluded, indicating that it could now be delayed into 2019.
Tata Steel yet to reach pact with unions
Tata Steel's proposed agreement with workers in the Netherlands has drawn opposition from Thyssenkrupp's own powerful unions who fear that its German sites could be treated less favourable in the venture.
“We will not accept worse conditions for the German sites,” said Detlef Wetzel, member of the works council of Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe, which is to be merged with Tata Steel Europe.
The deal marks a key step towards Thyssenkrupp's goal of becoming more focused on technology and industrial goods and cutting its reliance on the volatile steel sector, a shift welcomed by investors who are demanding further changes.
Following the joint venture's signing, Thyssenkrupp's management, led by Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger, will present a refined strategy to the group's supervisory board.
“With the planned joint venture Thyssenkrupp achieves a key prerequisite for a sharpening of the group's strategic target and subsequently also the financial targets,” it said.
That could involve selling Materials Services, Thyssenkrupp's largest division by sales, in which smaller rival Kloeckner & Co has long shown an interest."
127,2018-04-13,Tata Steel,"Blast furnace breakdown hits Tata Steel sales, output in fourth quarter
Tata Steel has reported six per cent decline in March quarter domestic sales at 3.01 million tonnes (mt) against 3.21 mt recorded in the same period last year.
Similarly, production dropped four per cent to 3.07 mt (3.20 mt) in the March quarter (Q4FY18), said the company in a statement on Friday.
The production was lower due to the breakdown in the blast furnace at the company’s recently inaugurated plant at Kalinganagar in Odisha.
The fall in Tata Steel sales comes even when the overall steel demand in the country is showing signs of revival with large-scale investment by the government and private sector companies.
Tata Steel Europe sales volumes were also lower at 2.48 mt (2.85 mt) in Q4FY18, while the production remained flat at 2.62 mt mainly due to unplanned outages, it said.
However, the production and sales volumes of the company in South-East Asia were stable on a quarter-on-quarter basis, according to the release.
In the financial year ended March, 2018, the company’s domestic sales were up 11 per cent at12.13 mt against 10.97 mt logged in the previous year. Production also increased seven per cent at12.48 mt (11.68 mt) in FY18."

Resistance caps the upside in SBI (₹251.2)
SBI failed to breach the key resistance level of ₹262 last week. The stock reversed sharply lower after making a high of ₹265.25 and closed 3.3 per cent down for the week. Immediate support is at ₹248. If SBI manages to sustain above this support, a bounce-back move to ₹262 is possible again. 
 








 
 
A strong break above ₹262 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹270 initially. Further break above ₹270 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹283 or ₹285. On the other hand, if SBI declines below the immediate support at ₹248 in the coming days, it can come under more pressure. Such a break can drag it to the crucial support level of ₹240. Whether SBI breaks below ₹240 or not will decide the next move. A bounce from ₹240 can keep it range-bound between ₹240 and ₹260 for some time. But a strong break and a decisive close below ₹240 can bring renewed pressure on the stock. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or ₹190 over the medium term.
ITC may remain range-bound (₹260.8)
ITC rallied as expected to test the resistance at ₹266. But it failed to sustain higher and came-off sharply from ₹268.2 and closed the week on a flat note. Inability to bounce from the current levels can keep the stock under pressure. Support is at ₹258. A break below it can drag the stock lower to ₹255 or even ₹250 in the short term. The region between ₹251 and ₹250 is a crucial support that has been limiting the downside since November. An upward reversal from this support region can take ITC higher to ₹260 and ₹265 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below ₹250 decisively. Such a break can take the stock lower to ₹245 or ₹244 initially. Further break below ₹244 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹235 or even lower. On the other hand, if ITC bounces from the immediate support at ₹258, it can move up to ₹265 or ₹267. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220
Infosys maintains its uptrend (₹1,169)
Infosys snapped its three-week fall as the psychological support at ₹1,100 held well. The stock made a low of ₹1,105 and surged to close the week 3.3 per cent higher. This upward reversal keeps the ₹1,100-₹1,200 sideways range intact. Infosys has been stuck in this range since February. As long as the stock remains above the ₹1,150-₹1,140 support zone, the possibility is high of it extending its upmove towards ₹1,200. Inability to break above ₹1,200 can drag Infosys lower to ₹1,150 or even lower. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound for some time. But if Infosys manages to breach ₹1,200 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹1,250 or ₹1,270. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 or even higher levels over the long term. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below the ₹1,100-₹1,090 support
Key resistance ahead for RIL (₹938.85)
RIL extended its rally for the second consecutive week. The stock surged 3.2 per cent in the past week. The near-term view remains positive. Support is in the ₹925-₹920 region. The stock can extend its current upmove and test the crucial resistance level of ₹960 in the coming days. Inability to break above ₹960 and a subsequent pull-back move will take the stock lower to ₹920. In such a scenario, the broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range will remain intact. RIL has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time. On the other hand, the stock will gain fresh momentum if it manages to breach ₹960 decisively. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹1,000 and ₹1,020 in the coming weeks. The outlook will turn negative only if the stock breaks below ₹870. But such a break look less probable at the moment. Traders who have taken long positions last week can hold it with a revised stop-loss at ₹920 and target of ₹955. Move the stop-loss further higher to ₹938 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹945.
Tata Steel lacks strength (₹593.3)
Tata Steel inched higher for the third consecutive week. The stock was up 1.5 per cent. Immediate support is at ₹588 — the 21-day moving average that is likely to be tested in the initial part of the week. An upward reversal from there will see the current rally extending towards ₹620 or even ₹630 in the coming weeks. Further break above ₹630 looks less likely now as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels. A pull-back fromthe level of ₹630 can drag the stock to ₹600 or even lower levels thereafter. On the other hand, if Tata Steel declines below the 21-day moving average (₹588) support, it can fall to ₹570 or ₹560. Further break below ₹560 will then increase the likelihood of the stock falling towards ₹550 or ₹545. The region between ₹550 and ₹545 is a key medium-term support. A break below ₹545 can take the stock lower to ₹535 initially. Further break below ₹535 will then increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or ₹500 over the medium term."

 With 12.48 million tonne (MT) production, Tata Steel India has recorded highest ever output for the fiscal 2017-18, mainly on the back of robust performance at Kalinganagar plant, according to a company official.
 This represents nearly 7 per cent higher output compared to 11.68 MT the company had produced in the preceding financial year.
 “Besides output, there were many firsts this year. It also achieved highest-ever annual sales of 12.13 million tonnes,” a company spokesperson said.
 The company had registered a sales of 10.97 MT in financial year 2016-17.
 For the first time, Tata Steel achieved the landmark of 1 million tonnes of annual exports. It also registered the best automotive sales of 1.86 million tonne, the spokesperson added.
 The entire value chain played a role in achieving these numbers but ramping up of its Kalinganagar plant was the most crucial factor to enable the company to achieve these milestones, according to the official.
 At 25.39 million tonnes, the company’s combined steel production from three geographies —India, Europe and South East Asia was up by 3.5 per cent in FY 2018 as compared to 24.52 MT in the previous fiscal, due to an improved performance in India and Europe operations.
 In India, Jamshedpur unit has a capacity of 10 MTPA and Kalinganagar is a 3 MTPA plant.

 The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) today asked the lenders of Bhushan Power & Steel, led by PNB, to consider the bid submitted by UK-based Liberty House for the debt-ridden company. Allowing the plea of Liberty House, the tribunal has directed the committee of creditors (CoC) to complete its resolution proceedings by June 23.
A two-member NCLT bench, headed by President Justice M M Kumar, said that Liberty House bid cannot be disqualified only on the ground of being submitted after the deadline of the resolution professional. “We hope that CoC takes an appropriate commercial decision as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC),” said NCLT.
The tribunal’s order came over a petition filed by Liberty House, challenging the rejection of its bid by the RP for Bhushan Power and Steel on account of late submission.
Liberty House had moved the NCLT on February 26 against the rejection.
The CoC had in February rejected Liberty House’s bid to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel, leaving Tata Steel and JSW Steel in the race for taking over the assets of the bankrupt firm. Liberty House had submitted before the NCLT that RP rejected its bid to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel without even opening the seal of its offer.

About 23 of 32 analysts covering JSW Steel rate it “buy” or higher with a median price target of Rs 323.50.


 Indian steel stocks are not yet factoring in spread expansion, Macquarie says, adding that domestic steel prices will remain on an uptrend with further hikes in May 2018.
Deutsche Bank (DB) says Indian steel companies had raised domestic steel prices by $12-$15 per tonne in May 2018. It adds that rising domestic steel prices and declining raw material prices have resulted in Indian steel spreads increasing by 18 per cent over last three months.
Macquarie says stocks are not yet factoring in the spread expansion and upside risk in earnings. DB says rising spreads on the back of increasing demand will help domestic steel players achieve robust profitability and JSW Steel Ltd is its preferred pick in the sector.
Macquarie believes Tata Steel Ltd offers best risk reward, adding cost inflation impacts co the least. It adds with stronger prices and downtrending raw material prices, Q1 2019 margins could see another $20/tonne Q-o-Q expansion and drive the earnings upgrades.
Macquarie retains 'outperform' on Tata Steel and JSW steel; DB maintains 'buy' on JSW Steel. About 23 of 32 analysts covering JSW Steel rate it “buy” or higher with a median price target of Rs 323.50, while 25 of 30 analysts recommend 'buy' or higher rating for Tata Steel with a median price target of Rs 818.94, according to Thomson Reuters data.

 In a bid to further trim its exposure in Europe, Tata Steel has identified five non-core assets for potential sale and has sought buyer interest in the assets.
Tata Steel Europe, which has a debt of around €3 billion, recently conducted a detailed portfolio review of all its businesses to assess their strategic fit and future potential. 
Based on the review, the company has begun a process of seeking buyers for business units that supply products to niche markets, allowing the company to continue to strengthen its focus on strategic strip products and markets, said Tata Steel in a statement on Tuesday.
Units for sale
The units identified for sale include Cogent — a manufacturer and processor of electrical steels based in Newport, South Wales (UK), Burlington (Canada) and Surahammar (Sweden). 
Two others on the block are Kalzip, an aluminium roofing and cladding business based primarily in Koblenz, Germany, and Firsteel, which coats steel for kitchen bakeware and is based in Walsall, West Midlands, UK.
This apart, Turkey-based Tata Steel Istanbul Metals, a coil coating company using steel bought from the open market, and Engineering Steels Service Centre (Wolverhampton) in the UK have also been put on the block.
Hans Fischer, CEO of Tata Steel’s European operations, said the customer bases for the businesses being sold are distinct from the rest of Tata Steel Europe. “We want to find the best owner for each of these business units ... to help them realise their full potential,” he said.
The potential sales would enable Tata Steel Europe to focus investment and management resources on its core strip products business and strategic markets. The company would also focus on developing the most sustainable steel business in Europe, he added.
Following the potential sale of these business units, which employ a total of 1,100, Tata Steel Europe would continue to employ 20,000 in manufacturing advanced products for the automotive, construction, engineering and packaging sectors.
Tata Steel had earlier sold other non-core businesses. It is also in the process of forming a joint venture with Thyssenkrupp AG to run the remaining European business."

SBI (₹250.9)
SBI rose 3.7 per cent last week. This rally has eased the downside pressure and turned the near-term view positive. So, traders can exit and book loss on the short positions taken a couple of weeks back. An immediate resistance is in the ₹253-₹254 region, which is likely to be tested in the early part of the week. A break above ₹254 can take the stock higher to ₹259 and ₹260. Further break above ₹260 can extend the up-move to ₹264 and ₹265. The level of ₹265 is a crucial short-term resistance. Inability to breach this hurdle can pull the stock lower to ₹255 and ₹250. In such a scenario, SBI can remain range-bound between ₹230 and ₹265 for some time. If SBI breaks above ₹265 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹270 or even ₹280 levels in the coming weeks. It will also signal that the downtrend that has been in place since November last year has come to an end.










 ITC (₹283.9) 
 ITC reversed higher last week and was up 2.3 per cent. The 55-week moving average at ₹277 has been providing strong support for the stock over the last two weeks, keeping the overall bullish outlook intact. However, a crucial resistance cluster is ahead in the ₹285-₹290 region. ITC has to breach above ₹290 decisively to keep the current uptrend intact. Price action on the charts suggests that the possibility is high of the stock breaching ₹290 and targeting ₹295 initially. Further break above ₹295 will take the stock up to ₹305. On the other hand, if ITC reverses lower from ₹290 , it can fall to ₹280 or ₹275 — a key short-term support. An immediate break below ₹275 looks less probable at the moment. If the stock manages to sustain above ₹275, a range-bound move between ₹275 and ₹290 can be seen in the short term. If ITC breaks below ₹275, a fall to ₹270 or ₹268 is possible. Long-term investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220.










 Infosys (₹1,181) 
 Infosys remained subdued and closed on a mixed note last week. The 21-day moving average at ₹1,167 had provided strong support for the stock. As long as Infosys remains above this support, It can break above the crucial ₹1,200-₹1,205 resistance region. Such a break will mark the end of the prolonged sideways consolidation phase. The stock has been stuck in the band between ₹1,100 and ₹1,200 since January. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,205 will take the stock higher to revisit the previous highs of ₹1,278. Such a rally will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 and ₹1,375 levels over the medium term. The near-term view will turn negative if the stock declines below the 21-day moving average. In such a scenario, a fall to ₹1,140 or ₹1,135 levels is possible. Further break below ₹1,135 will see the down-move extending to ₹1,100 . Both medium- and long-term investors can hold their long positions.










RIL (₹988.5)
RIL managed to reverse higher in the past week and has recovered most of the loss made in the week earlier. The stock surged 3.6 per cent last week. Though the weekly chart gives a mixed picture, the daily candles leave the near-term outlook positive. A test of the psychological resistance level of ₹1,000 is possible. A strong break above ₹1,000 will take the stock higher to ₹1,030 . Whether RIL breaks above ₹1,030 or not will decide the next move. Inability to break above ₹1,030 can pull the stock lower to ₹1,000. A break below ₹1,000, will see the down-move extending towards ₹980 or ₹970. On the other hand, if RIL manages to break above ₹1,030 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum and rally towards ₹1,085. The 21-day moving average at ₹959 is a key support. The outlook will turn negative only if RIL declines below this support. A strong break below ₹959 will then increase the possibility of the stock falling to ₹930 or even ₹900 .










 Tata Steel (₹606)
Tata Steel has risen, breaking above the key psychological resistance level of ₹600 last week. This has eased the downside pressure and is also slightly turning the bias positive. The key resistance is in the ₹615-620 region is likely to be tested in the coming days. Traders who have taken short position last week on rallies at ₹590 and ₹596 can exit and book loss at current level. Whether Tata Steel breaks above ₹620 or not will be key in deciding the next move. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹620 ease the downside pressure. Such a break will take the stock higher to ₹635 or even to ₹650. This move above ₹620 could be swift on the back of short covering. On the other hand, if Tata Steel reverses lower from ₹620, it can fall to ₹600 initially. If it manages to bounce from this psychological support, a range-bound move between ₹600 and ₹620 can be seen for some time. But a break below ₹600 can drag the stock lower to ₹585."

L&T, which is an operational creditor of Bhushan Steel, had sought higher priority in recovery of debt in the resolution process on par with the financial creditors.
The Tribunal has also rejected Bhushan Energy’s plea to continue its power purchase agreement with Bhushan Steel. The order was pronounced in the court today and a detailed judgment is awaited.
Earlier on April 11, the Principal Bench of the Tribunal had reserved its order after hearing all the sides.
The Committee of Creditors (CoC) had approved a Rs 32,500-crore deal along with 12.27 per cent equity in Bhushan Steel offered by Tata Steel.
However, some employees of Bhushan Steel had challenged it before NCLT contending that Tata Steel was not eligible under section 29 (A) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)."

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday approved the ₹32,500-crore resolution plan submitted by Tata Steel for debt-ridden Bhushan Steel.
The tribunal also imposed a penalty of ₹1 lakh each on Larsen and Toubro and on Bhushan Steel employees.
While the employees had filed an appeal against Tata Steel’s bid, L&T, which has outstanding dues of ₹900 crore from Bhushan Steel, had appealed to the Tribunal to reclassify it as secured creditor so that it can recover more money from the insolvency resolution.
The Bench, comprising NCLT President Justice MM Kumar and SK Mohapatra, also dismissed Bhushan Energy’s plea to direct Tata Steel, the new owners of Bhushan Steel, to continue with its power purchase agreement.
With the deal now approved by NCLT, Tata Steel will add 5.6 million tonnes per annum to its existing capacity of 13 mtpa and emerge as the largest steel producer in the country, ahead of JSW Steel.
Bhushan Steel’s committee of creditors (CoC) had approved Tata Steel’s resolution plan, which includes an allotment of 12.27 per cent equity in the company to creditors. The company, which was admitted for insolvency proceedings last February, had defaulted on its ₹56,000-crore loan.
As it found a new suitor in Tata Steel, the Bhushan Steel scrip was locked at 5 per cent in the upper circuit at ₹23.95 on Tuesday. This will be the second resolution for stressed assets to receive final NCLT approval.
Earlier, Vedanta had bagged Electrosteel Steels with its resolution plan, which involved a cash payout of about ₹5,300-crore and a haircut of 60 per cent to lenders.
Electrosteel plan
Electrosteel owes lenders over ₹13,000 crore, of which about ₹5,000 crore is to State Bank of India alone.
Vedanta had said one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries would subscribe to the share capital of Electrosteel for an aggregate amount of ₹1,805 crore and provide additional funds aggregating to ₹3,515 crore by way of debt."
117,2018-05-16,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel Q4 consolidated net profit at ₹ 14,688 cr 
 Domestic steel giant Tata Steel today reported consolidated net profit of ₹ 14,688.02 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018. The company had clocked a net loss of ₹ 1,168.02 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.
 The total consolidated income of the company increased to ₹ 36,407.19 crore in January-March 2018, from ₹ 35,457.06 crore in the same quarter of FY17.
 The total expenses of the company stood at ₹ 32,626.42 crore during the quarter as against ₹ 31,132.02 crore in the year-ago period.
 T V Narendran, CEO & MD of the company, said: “Tata Steel performance has been robust in FY18 driven by our strong execution strategy and supported by favourable global demand-supply balance. During the year, our Indian operations delivered volume growth better than the market on the back of the ramp-up at our Kalinganagar plant and the strength of our marketing network and brand equity“.
 He said growth was broad-based across marketing segments and added that Tata Steel Europe had a good quarter despite currency headwinds.
“The UK pension scheme restructuring process has also been completed. The 50:50 JV discussion with thyssenkrupp is progressing well and we are committed towards building a strong European portfolio,” Narendran said.
 He added that the company continues to execute its strategy of expanding footprint in India.
“Kalinganagar Phase 2 expansion is progressing well, which will take our capacity from 13 million tonnes (MT) to 18 MT of crude steel. I am also happy to share that NCLT has given its approval on our resolution plan for Bhushan Steel. We have also received CCI approval for this transaction,” he said.
On the steel outlook, he said the company is closely watching the developments in global steel trade because of US’ protectionist measures and added, “However, we continue to be bullish on steel prices and spreads with improving demand situation in India“.
 Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and CFO, said FY18 has been a good year for the company and the group delivered a strong top and bottom line growth.
 “We completed 2 large financing transactions, which apart from providing funds also gives us significant flexibility to pursue our growth plans. Our $1.3 bn international bond issue in January 2018 helped us extend our maturity profile. We also successfully completed a $2 bn Rights Issue, one of the largest equity issuance in India,” he said.
The shares of the company closed at Rs 622.05 on the BSE, down 0.32 per cent from the previous close."
116,2018-05-16,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel posts ₹14,600-crore profit on one-time gain from UK pension scheme
Tata Steel has reported a consolidated net profit of ₹14,688 crore in the March quarter against a net loss of ₹1,168 crore logged in the same period last year. The profit was boosted by one-time gain of ₹14,077 crore.
Consolidated total revenues increased 2.34 per cent to ₹32,132.30 crore (₹35,304.89 crore).
The company has announced a dividend of ₹10 on ordinary share and ₹2.50 per partly-paid ordinary share.
UK pension scheme
Explaining the one-time gain, the company said the entire process for the UK pension restructuring is now complete and the new scheme has a non-cash £2.2 billion accounting surplus under IAS19 (International Accounting Standard). 
Out of this, a non-cash gain of £1.64 billion (₹14,077 crore) has been treated as the exceptional gain during the quarter.
The surplus will continue to support the pension scheme, allowing it to run its required low-risk investment strategy protecting its members. 
This is an optimal and sustainable outcome for pensioners, current employees and the UK business.
The acquisition of Corus Group between April 2007 until September 2017, £1.7 billion of charges were taken through the books of Tata Steel UK either through the profit and loss account or other comprehensive income in relation to the old British Steel Pension Scheme. 
In addition, in the September 2017 quarter, when the BSPS was separated from Tata Steel UK by way of a Regulated Apportionment Arrangement, a £554-million cash payment and a 33 per cent equity stake of the company was transferred into the scheme, it said.
The binding joint venture agreement with Thyssenkrupp is expected to be signed in the first quarter of this fiscal.
The company has recognised an exceptional charge of ₹1,607 crore including charge of ₹1,484 crore on account of net provision recognised in respect of certain demands and claims from regulatory authorities relating to mining operations
T V Narendran, Managing Director, Tata Steel, said the Indian operations delivered volume growth better than the market on the back of the ramp-up at Kalinganagar plant.
“Kaliganagar expansion will take our capacity from 13 mtpa to 18 mtpa of crude steel. I am also happy to share that NCLT has given its approval on our resolution plan for Bhushan Steel. We have also received the CCI approval for this transaction,” he said."

 The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) will next week hear Bhushan Steel promotor Neeraj Singal’s plea against acquisition of the company by Tata Steel. Singal has sought a stay on the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) order approving Tata Steel’s bid for the debt-ridden Bhushan Steel under the corporate insolvency resolution process.
The petition was mentioned today before an NCLAT bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya, which directed it to be listed on Monday for hearing. Singal has also requested the appellate tribunal to maintain status quo over the company’s shareholding. Singal holds around 22 per cent stake in Bhushan Steel.
On May 15, NCLT had approved the resolution plan submitted by the resolution professional of Bhushan Steel, with Tata Steel emerging as the highest bidder. The Committee of Creditors (CoC) had approved the Rs 32,500-crore deal, along with 12.27 per cent equity in the company offered by Tata Steel."
114,2018-05-17,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel’s India operations are on a strong footing, but debt level a concern
The market’s subdued reaction to Tata Steel’s fourth quarter numbers may have been due to concerns over the increase in the debt levels after the acquisition of Bhushan Steel is completed.
Tata Steel reported a robust set of numbers for the quarter. It reported a consolidated net profit of ₹14,688 crore for the period, against a net loss of ₹1,168 crore logged during the Q4 last year. The profit was boosted by a one-time gain of ₹14,077 crore.
Consolidated revenues from operations increased by 8 per cent YoY to ₹36,132 crore.
Despite an unscheduled plant shutdown, the company managed to deliver healthy numbers from both its domestic and European operations. With capacity expansion plans in India and restructuring activities in Europe, the company is well positioned to build a strong earnings profile that could bring down the debt to reasonable levels by boosting operating profits.
Getting stronger in India
The production of crude steel in the quarter fell by 4 per cent y-o-y to 3.07 million tonnes. 
Due to the weak volumes, the revenue for the quarter fell by nearly 5 per cent y-o-y to ₹16,281 crore. However, the company delivered higher operational profits of ₹4,823 crore, a rise of about 12 per cent y-o-y. This was due to the better realisations for steel in the quarter. The EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) per tonne has also improved by 18 per cent to ₹15,932 per tonne.
The outage issue has been resolved and the plant is running at full capacity, according to the management.
Europe solution
Over the past two years, Tata Steel has been spinning off parts of its debt-laden, loss-making European business that was bleeding the consolidated financials. Tata Steel Europe, which has contributed nearly ₹3,792 crore to the group’s operating profit (17 per cent of consolidated operating profit) is going to form a 50:50 joint venture (JV) with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp AG.
 Also, the company proposes to monetise few downstream assets in Europe. However, it is expected that the contribution from Bhushan Steel will be able to compensate for the loss of operating profit from Europe.
Huge debt
The consolidated net debt was ₹69,215 crore as on March 31, 2018. At these levels, the net debt to operating profit ratio stood at 3.13 times, lower than the 4.24 times reported a year ago. In the next few years, though debt close to ₹20,000 crore gets deconsolidated due to the JV with Thyssenkrupp AG, an amount of about ₹35,000 crore that will be raised to acquire Bhushan Steel will increase the net debt levels to approximately ₹84,000 crore. 
But the management is confident of maintaining the debt coverage ratio at around three times over the long run."
112,2018-05-18,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel becomes the first to buy a stressed asset under IBC
 With the acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd (BSL) for ₹35,200 crore, Tata Steel has emerged the first company to acquire a stressed asset under the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
The company has received all the approvals and will own 73 per cent in the company. It will absorb all the employees of the company as per the resolution plan submitted and approved by the committee of creditors. 
Tata Steel also plans to keep the company listed for the next 2-3 years. The acquisition is being done by Bamnipal Steel Ltd (BNPL), a subsidiary of Tata Steel. 
“BNPL has successfully completed the acquisition of controlling stake of 72.65 per cent in BSL in accordance with the approved resolution plan under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC) which has been managed by Vijaykumar V lyer, Partner, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP, in his capacity as the resolution professional,” Tata Steel said in a statement.
The admitted CIRP cost and employee dues have been paid as required under IBC. Settlement of the amounts equivalent to ₹35,200 crore towards financial creditors of BSL is being undertaken as per the terms of the resolution plan and corresponding transaction documents, the company said.
Tata Steel said ₹1,200 crore will be paid to operational creditors of BSL over a period of 12 months. 
“The investment from BNPL in BSL has been done through a combination of equity of ₹158 crore and inter-corporate loan of ₹34,963 crore . Additionally, ₹100 crore has been paid by BNPL to the financial creditors of BSL as consideration for novation of remaining financial debt of BSL.
“The acquisition is being financed through a combination of external bridge loan of Rs 16,500 crore availed by BNPL and balance amount through investment by Tata Steel in BNPL. The bridge loan availed by BNPL is expected to be replaced by debt raised at BSL over time,” it said.
Incorporated in 1983, Bhushan Steel is currently fifth largest integrated steel plant with a crude steel capacity of about 5.6 million tonne per annum (mtpa) along with downstream facilities of cold rolled products of about 2 mtpa. It caters to major auto industry and consumer durable manufacturers through its upstream facilities in Meramandali, Odisha and downstream facilities in Khopoli, Maharashtra and Sahibabad, Uttar Pradesh."

 SBI (₹239.2)
SBI began the week on a positive note, but it was short-lived. The stock touched a high of ₹257.2 and came off sharply from there to close 4.7 per cent lower for the week. The near-term view is bearish. A fall to test the crucial support level of ₹231 is likely. If SBI manages to bounce from ₹231, the downside pressure would ease. A relief rally to ₹250 or ₹255 is possible then. Also, a range-bound move between ₹231 and ₹255 is possible for some time in such a scenario. But if SBI breaks below ₹231 decisively, it can come under renewed pressure. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or ₹195 over the medium term. The region around ₹195 is a strong long-term support which can halt the downtrend that has been in place since November last year. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go short at current levels and on rallies at ₹245. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹265 for the target of ₹200. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹240 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹225.










 ITC (₹282.1)
ITC was volatile last week. The stock has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹276 and ₹290 over the last three weeks. Last week’s candle on the weekly chart reflects indecisiveness in the market. This leaves the short-term outlook unclear for the stock. A breakout on either side of ₹276 or ₹290 will decide the next move. If ITC declines below ₹276, it can fall to test the ₹269-₹267 support region. A bounce from this support zone will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹280 and ₹285 again. But a strong break below ₹267can drag the stock lower to ₹260 or even ₹255. On the other hand, if ITC manages to sustain above ₹276 in the coming days and breaches ₹290, it can move higher to ₹296 initially. Inability to break above ₹296 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹289. But a strong break above ₹296 will see the stock rallying to ₹303 or ₹305. Such a rally will also mark the end of the downtrend that has been in place since last July. Long-term investors can hold the long positions.










 Infosys (₹1,183.7)
Infosys has been testing the psychological level of ₹1,200 over the last four consecutive weeks. However, the stock seems to be lacking fresh buyers to take it decisively above ₹1,200. It has been facing strong resistance around ₹1,210. A strong break above this hurdle is needed for Infosys to gain fresh momentum. Such a break will see Infosys testing the previous highs of ₹1,278 levels. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 and ₹1,375 levels over the medium term. On the other hand, if Infosys continues to remain below ₹1,200, a fall to ₹1,160 is possible in the near term. It will keep the broader ₹1,100-₹1,200 sideways range intact. The stock has been stuck in this range since January. Further break below ₹1,160 can drag the stock to ₹1,140 or ₹1,135. A bounce from ₹1,135 can trigger a relief rally to ₹1,160 or ₹1,170. But a strong break below ₹1,135 will see Infosys falling towards ₹1,100. Further fall below ₹1,100 is unlikely. Both medium- and long-term investors can hold the long positions.










 RIL (₹933.4)
RIL tumbled over 5 per cent last week. The stock hovers above an immediate support level of ₹929 — the 21-week moving average. This support has been limiting the downside over the last four weeks. If RIL manages to sustain above this support and reverse higher, it can move up to test ₹1,000 levels again. Inability to break above ₹1,000 can continue to keep the stock range-bound between ₹929 and ₹1,000 for some more time. But a strong break above ₹1,000 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹1,030 or ₹1,035. The region between ₹1,030 and ₹1,035 is a crucial medium-term resistance for the stock. Whether RIL breaks above ₹1,035 or not will be key in deciding the next move. On the other hand, if RIL breaks below the immediate support level of ₹929, it can fall to ₹900 or ₹890 in the coming days. A crucial medium-term trend deciding support is poised around ₹890. A decisive weekly close below ₹890 may trigger a sharp corrective fall to ₹850. So the price action around ₹890 will need a close watch.










 Tata Steel (₹591.5)
Tata Steel surged, breaking above the key ₹615-₹620 resistance region last week, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made an intra-week high of ₹636.3 and reversed sharply lower, giving back all the gains made and closed 2.5 per cent lower for the week. Technically, the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance at ₹631 has halted the up-move and triggered the reversal. This indicates that the downtrend that has been in place since January is intact. Immediate resistance is inbetween ₹600 and ₹605. Inability to bounce from the current levels and breach this hurdle can continue to keep the stock under pressure. A fall to ₹570-₹565 is likely. If Tata Steel manages to bounce from ₹565 to ₹570, a relief rally to ₹600 is possible. But a break below ₹565 can drag the stock to ₹550. Traders with high risk appetite can go short on rallies at ₹598 and ₹605. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹615 for the target of ₹570. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹590 when it moves down to ₹580."
109,2018-05-21,Tata Steel,"NCLAT issues notice to Tata Steel on eligibility of bid for Bhushan Steel
 Less than week after sealing the deal to acquire Bhushan Steel, Tata Steel has received a notice from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on a case filed by Bhushan Steel promoter Neeraj Singal, who has challenged Tata Steel’s eligibility to bid under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. 
While Singal had sought a stay on Tata Steel’s acquisition, the NCLAT, headed by Chairman Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya, issued notices to Tata Steel, the resolution professional and Bhushan Steel’s Committee of Creditors to file their response. 
“Let us decide the law but not stall the process,” the Bench said. Singal, who owns a 22 per cent stake in Bhushan Steel, claimed that no notice was given to him by the creditors while finalising the deal with Tata Steel. The sale of Bhushan Steel to Tata Steel would be subject to the final outcome of the case, the Bench added, posting the hearing in the matter for May 30 and asked the parties to file their replies within a week.
Meanwhile, Bhushan operational creditor L&T has also approached the NCLAT against NCLT for rejecting its plea to be considered a financial creditor.
Bhushan Steel owes L&T ₹900 crore. As a financial creditor, L&T can recover more and limit the haircut it has to take.
Earlier dismissing L&T’s plea, the NCLT had levied a penalty of ₹1 lakh on the company. L&T’s plea will come up for hearing at the NCLAT on May 22. 
On May 18, Tata Steel had announced that it has acquired 73 per cent stake in Bhushan Steel for ₹35,200 crore. Tata Steel had said ₹1,200 crore will be paid to operational creditors of BSL over a period of 12 months."

 The acquisition of debt-laden Bhushan Steel, under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework, will reduce bad loans of PSBs by Rs 35,000 crore, Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar today said.
“IBC transforming credit culture in New India. About Rs 35,000 crore reduction of NPAs of PSBs in Bhushan Steel case. Reduction of NPAs in individual PSBs range from about Rs 500 crore to over Rs 10,000 crore, he tweeted.
 Last week, Tata Steel, through its subsidiary, completed the acquisition of controlling stake of 72.65 per cent in Bhushan Steel for around Rs 36,400 crore after emerging as the winning bidder in an insolvency auction. Kumar said following the Bhusan Steel buyout, public sector banks (PSBs) will write back Rs 7,500 crore of loans which were earlier classified as NPAs. 
“Future upside through over 6 crore equity shares acquired by PSBs. Decisive shift towards clean credit culture,” Kumar tweeted. 
 Last week, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal had tweeted that the acquisition was a “historic breakthrough in resolving legacy issues of banks”.
 Bhushan Steel was among the 12 stressed assets the Reserve Bank of India had referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) proceedings last year."
108,2018-05-22,Tata Steel,"NCLAT issues notice to Bhushan Steel’s resolution professional, CoC on L&T’s plea
 The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal has issued a notice to the resolution professional (RP) and Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Bhushan Steel over the plea filed by its operational creditor L&T.
NCLAT also impleaded Tata Steel, whose bid for the debt-ridden firm has been approved, as party over L&T’s plea seeking to recover Rs 900 crore.
“Let notice be issued to CoC and RP. File their replies by May 28,” the NCLAT Bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya said today.
The Bench has directed that the matter be listed on May 30 for next hearing. It has also directed the engineering and construction major to file a certified copy of NCLT order.
On May 15, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had approved the resolution plan submitted by the resoution professional of Bhushan Steel, which has found Tata Steel as the highest bidder. CoC had approved the Rs 32,500 crore deal along with 12.27 per cent equity in the company offered by Tata Steel.
During the proceedings, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appearing for L&T submitted that the operational creditors are getting nothing from Rs 32,500 crore offer from Tata Steel.
“Though RP admits our claims of Rs 500 crore but we would get nothing,” he said, adding “Rs 32,500 crore would be swallowed by the banks’’. 
Earlier, on May 15, while approving Tata Steel’s bid, NCLT had dismissed the plea of L&T seeking higher priority in recovery of loan and imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh."
107,2018-05-22,Tata Steel,"Bhushan breakthrough 
 After innumerable twists, turns and dead-ends, India’s new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code may have yielded its first significant success, with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approving Tata Steel’s winning bid to acquire the distressed Bhushan Steel for ₹36,400 crore. The denouement in its case has been better than expected because the deal entails a less than 30 per cent haircut for financial creditors and allows them to recover many times the liquidation value. Public sector banks (PSBs) will get a much-needed breather from this deal, with a ₹35,000-crore reduction in non-performing assets (NPAs) and ₹7,500 crore in write-backs to shore up their bottom-lines. One therefore hopes that the deal manages to navigate the pending hearings before the Appellate Tribunal from Bhushan Steel’s promoter and L&T, an operational creditor. 
But the Bhushan Steel case offers no grounds for complacency about the scores of other cases before the NCLT. Bhushan Steel attracted enthusiastic bidding because its value-added steel capacities are particularly sought-after, amid the global upswing in the steel cycle. It is unlikely that bidders will similarly throng to the smaller steelmakers or beleaguered firms in sectors such as infrastructure/EPC, power generation or ship-building, which account for a third of the NCLT cases. These sectors are plagued by over-capacity and there aren’t too many viable domestic players to bid for distressed assets. In a recent analysis, CLSA pointed out that the haircuts on some of these non-steel assets could be as high as 75-80 per cent. This would mean further blood-letting for PSBs, whose financials are already in a parlous state. This puts the Centre in a quandary because, after its ₹2.11 lakh-crore recapitalisation largesse, it can ill-afford to spend further taxpayer money on shoring up PSBs’ perpetually short capital adequacy ratios. 
So policymakers must ensure that the remaining cases at NCLT attract the widest possible range of bidders. Going by the experience so far, this may call for at least a couple of tweaks to the current bidding process. One, while the IBC is quite right to bar promoters or wilful defaulters from bidding, the qualification criteria must not be set so tight that it rules out other healthy players. On this count, perhaps the code can take a more liberal view on ‘connected persons’ bidding for assets. Two, in the Essar Steel and Bhushan Power cases, lucrative bidders have submitted their offers after the expiry of the initial deadlines leading to legal tangles. A shift from closed bidding to a competitive open auction system may not just obviate the need for multiple rounds of bidding, but also ensure fierce competition among bidders, thus maximising gain for lenders."

 Private sector lender YES Bank has recovered 66 per cent of the original claim filed for Rs 325 crore after the sale of Bhushan Steel to Tata Steel under the insolvency resolution process. “YES Bank has recovered an amount of Rs 184 crore against an original claim filed for Rs 325 crore pursuant to the sale of Bhushan Steel to Tata Steel Ltd under the recently concluded NCLT/Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings,” YES Bank said in a BSE filing.
YES Bank said with this recovery, it now has an exposure to only one account, aggregating to only Rs 23.4 crore (with 50 per cent provision) as on March 31, 2018, from borrowers referenced in the first list of the RBI IBC NCLT process.
Earlier, it had recovered Rs 32 crore through sale of pledged shares. Total recoveries (against claims of Rs 325 crore) is Rs 216 crore (66 per cent), it said. YES Bank said write-back of provisions consequent to the above recoveries was Rs 36 crore.
In June last year, RBI’s internal advisory committee (IAC) identified 12 accounts, each having more than Rs 5,000 crore of outstanding loans and accounting for 25 per cent of total NPAs of banks.

That firing resorted to by Tamil Nadu police against anti-Sterlite protestors who were taking out a massive rally to the Thoothukudi district Collectorate demanding the immediate closure of Sterlite Copper smelter plant of Vedanta group had claimed at least 10 human lives is reprehensible. It is nothing but a state sponsored murder which cannot be justified on any grounds. The ghastly incident is a telling commentary on poor handling of law and order machinery of the ruling AIADMK government. Rather than engaging with the protestors through dialogue and discussion, the State government has let the situation to turn volatile on the ground. Violence unleashed by the protestors could have been easily averted if the district administration had reached out to them in a bid to address their legitimate grievances relating to the Sterlite Copper Smelter plant on time. It is time state authorities reach out to the anti- Sterlite protestors and strive itself to address their legitimate grievances relating to Sterlite plant without any delay.

With reference to ‘Karnataka has halted BJP’s jaggernaut: CPI(M)’(May 23), CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury’s perception that just because the BJP’s chief ministerial candidate BS Yediyurappa could not pass the trust vote despite having 104 MLAs cannot be termed as ‘halted juggernaut’ by his chums. The fact remains that voters of Karnataka have clearly rejected Congress and the JD (S) by electing 104 MLAs from BJP which is no mean achievement. The leaders of political parties inimical to BJP hailing and giving thumbs up to the unholy alliance of Congress-JD (S) portrays their short-sightedness. The leaders of CPI (M) should seriously introspect the humiliating defeat they have suffered in the West Bengal local polls by making all out efforts to reinvigorate the party instead of merely giving statements in media.

Bhushan resolution
With reference to your editorial ‘Bhushan breakthrough’, it is true that bankers get a breather on NCLT approving Tata Steel’s winning bid to acquire Bhushan Steel for ₹36,400 crore with a little less than 30 per cent haircut for creditors. The bankers on the other hand can not expect all other cases pending with NCLT would be settled in such a smooth way. Bankers cannot expect other insolvency cases to attract the same kind of enthusiastic bidding that Bhushan Steel attracted. In some of the other sectors, bakers may have to take a haircut of up to 75-80 per cent. At this juncture PSBs can ill-afford to spend the taxpayers money any further. For this the policy makers must tweak the norms for bidding. Ultimately the NCLT and the government should ensure that the haircut for banks is minimum. This will go a long way in the history of banking sector.

Oil price rise
The price of petrol is at its peak right now, and it may go up further unless it is kept in check. One culprit is taxes and the GST not being levied on it. In the last few months taxes on fuel was increased several times. Rise in petrol price creates a domino effect on prices of other commodities. This contributes to inflation and economically disadvantaged citizens suffer the consequences.
By not bringing petro products under the ambit of GST, the government is making a mockery of the biggest indirect tax reform.
Ever since the NDA government came to power, rises in the price of petrol and other necessary items have burdened the common man. It is most unfortunate that the government has refused to lower taxes on petrol on the plea that it needs funding for its expenditure. Who will provide such an easy funding to its citizens for its legitimate expenses? The government should take steps to control oil prices, while ensuring that oil companies make a reasonable profit. A list of necessary items must be made and by an amendment in Parliament, it should make sure that there is zero taxation levied on them by Centre or State government.

104,2018-05-25,Tata Steel,"Positives and negatives of the India story


Fiscal_deficit




Fiscal_deficit


 In February 2015, a photograph went viral on the Internet, with opinions divided on whether it was coloured blue-black or white-gold. A similar, earlier example had viewers debating whether the picture was of a young girl or an old hag. Our views are shaped by our perceptions and, as the Moody Blues sang in ‘Knights in White Satin’, ‘red is grey and yellow black, but we decide which is right, and which is an illusion’.
We need to see both sides of the story before reaching a conclusion. India’s story has negative as well as positive sides to it.
Amongst the negatives are a weakening current account deficit (CAD), thanks to a sharp rise in prices of crude oil, which has resulted in a weakening currency, which, in turn, has lowered the dollar returns for foreign investors. Higher price of crude has resulted in high petrol/diesel prices, resulting in higher inflation, to counter which the RBI may need to raise interest rates. The risk of a higher fiscal deficit is also worrying investors, as is the slow pace of job creation. 
Yes, higher crude prices have caused a deterioration in CAD and a fall in the rupee, but the question investors, including foreign ones, need to ask is whether crude oil will continue rising, and the rupee continue weakening, for long.
Compensating factors
Fiscal deficit will likely be more than the estimated 3.2 per cent, at 3.5 per cent. GST tax collections and sale of PSU stocks would compensate higher expenditure, provided the government does not go on a spending spree prior to the 2019 general elections.
Creation of new jobs continues to be a worrying problem, especially in the backdrop of increasing automation/robotics. These would, one imagines, come more from small and medium enterprises rather than large manufacturing units.
Amongst the positives is a forecast of normal monsoons. With the majority of population dependent on agriculture, which contributes 14 per cent to national income, a growth in this would help achieve the GDP growth target of 7.5 per cent.
The legacy issues of bad loans in the banking sector is being addressed. The introduction of the bankruptcy law has resulted in settlement of dues; over 2,100 companies have settled ₹83,000 crore of bank dues. The buyout by a Tata Steel subsidiary of Bhushan Steel has also helped free a big chunk of corporate debt, and is the harbinger, hopefully, of more such deals.
Creation of roads is progressing well, at a significantly higher clip than during previous governments, and now the focus will be on developing India’s waterways, a far cheaper form of transportation.
Where we now need to focus is our areas of weakness, viz, the slowness of the judiciary, and the enforceability of contracts. Foreign investors, both direct and indirect, are reluctant to come in because they do not trust courts to enforce contracts. 
Indian retail investors are switching from bank deposits to mutual funds for investing their savings and providing the cash flow for a sustained bull run. But our policies have to be proactive and suitable.

 The company law appellate tribunal today asked Tata Steel if it will clear the statutory dues like income tax and GST of Bhushan Steel, a company it had acquired in the insolvency proceedings earlier this month.
The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), hearing appeals against the acquisition filed by Bhushan Steel’s founding Singal family and the firm’s operational creditor Larsen and Toubro, asked Tata Steel to submit a statement of statutory dues of the company.
The two member bench headed by NCLAT Chairman, Justice S J Mukhopadhaya also asked the Resolution Professional, which oversaw the auction of Bhushan Steel, to state how much would L&T get from Rs 532 crore offered to all the operational creditors.
Bhushan Steel owed its lenders about Rs 56,000 crore and was among the 12 big loan defaulters identified by the Reserve Bank of India last year to undergo insolvency under the new bankruptcy law. Tata Steel offered Rs 35,200 crore in cash to acquire Bhushan Steel. It would pay another Rs 1,200 crore over next 12 months to creditors and convert the remaining debt owed to banks to equity.
After the entire exercise, Tata would hold 75 per cent stake and banks would get 12.27 per cent. Singal family would be left with 2.5 per cent and the remaining 10 per cent would be public holding. While L&T wants to recover its Rs 956 crore dues, Singal family has made a Rs 28,592 crore counter-offer.
During the proceedings, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi opposed the Rs 28,592 crore offer by Neeraj Singal. “This Rs 28,592 crore offer in 14 years is a spoiler,” he said. Meanwhile, senior advocate S Ganesh appearing for Singal submitted that Tata Steel was ineligible to bid for Bhushan Steel under section 29 A of IBC.
The section mandates that a person convicted for any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more is ineligible for submitting a resolution plan. Tata Steel UK, a foreign subsidiary of Tata Steel, was fined by an English Court in February 2018, he added.
The appellate tribunal has listed the matter on July 3 for next hearing. Neeraj Singal and L&T had filed appeals challenging May 15 order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that had approved Tata Steel’s bid for Bhushan Steel."
102,2018-06-07,Tata Steel,"With ₹6,000-cr bid, Tata Steel leads race to buy Usha Martin 
 Tata Steel has placed an aggressive bid of ₹6,000 crore to acquire Kolkata-based Usha Martin, a specialty steel producer with a production capacity of 1 million tonnes in Jamshedpur. The promoters of Usha Martin are selling the steel business to pare the Group’s debt.
“Tata Steel had a meeting with Usha Martin officials in Kolkata on Wednesday and in all probability they will outbid JSW Steel, which has placed a bid of ₹5,500 crore,” said sources close to the development.
Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta, which has entered the steel business with the recent acquisition of Electrosteel through the NCLT-driven insolvency process, is also believed to be in the race to acquire Usha Martin, he added.
Usha Martin is one of the largest wire-rope manufacturers in the world and leading specialty steel manufacturer in India. The company set up its first long product plant in 1974 near Jamshedpur. 
The plant uses high-quality iron ore and coal from captive mines, enabling it to achieve consistent quality in steel products. Former SEBI Chairman GN Bajpai is the Chairman of Usha Martin. 
Eye on synergy 
Though the price being quoted is a bit high, it makes business sense as Tata Steel can work out synergies given that the Usha Martin facility is close to its mother plant in Jamshedpur, said an analyst. Tata Steel can enhance its profit margin by ramping up the production at Usha Martin, diverting a portion of its 10-mt capacity in Jamshedpur to produce specialty steel, he added.
With a history of over 50 years, Usha Martin also has a global base for wire rope manufacturing with facilities in the UK, Dubai and Bangkok. 
The plant mostly caters to clients from the automotive, heavy earth-moving equipment and oil and gas sectors.
As of March-end, Usha Martin had a debt of about ₹3,700 crore. Last fiscal year, it trimmed losses to ₹282 crore from ₹354 crore a year earlier. However, revenue rose 24 per cent to ₹4,038 crore (₹3,246 crore) last fiscal year."

The body representing workers at Tata Steel’s European operations has raised concerns about the planned merger with ThyssenKrupp, including the potential prioritisation of “shareholder dividends over the long-term development of the joint venture” and “significant gaps” in their understanding of proposed venture. 
It has urged better engagement from ThyssenKrupp and commitments on five key tests from the two companies, warning that they remained “unconvinced’ that the deal as it stood represented the best interests of Tata Steel Europe operations and employees. 
The statement from the European Works Council came after a June 7 meeting in IJmuiden in the Netherlands, which was held to consider the findings of Syndex, trade union consultants, hired by the council to analyse the deal and propose steps forward. 
While the companies’ ongoing consultation process with employees had been conducted “in the right spirit” and “extensive efforts” had been made to disclose information, there were still “significant gaps” that made it hard to reach definitive conclusions, the EWC said on Monday. 
It pointed to the lack of information on the financial structure of the deal and “continued unwillingness” by ThyssenKrupp to engage with the EWC and its advisors. “This situation is deeply regrettable.”
While recognising the “industrial rationale” of the joint venture, Syndex recommended that the unions opposed the current business plan. “Syndex concluded that given the huge financial power of the JV the planned synergies on capex, jobs and R&D are completely unacceptable,” said the EWC. 
While the EWC did not go as far as to express opposition to the business plan, they called for commitments including a moratorium on job reductions till 2022, maintaining the research and development budget at the very least at the current combined level of the two companies and for none of the Tata Steel sites to be closed before 2026. They also called for a rethink on the decision to sell the Cogent Electricals steels business as part of a wider strategy to focus on core markets.
A spokesperson for Tata Steel said they welcomed the EWC’s recognition of the industrial rationale for the joint venture.
 “We believe in the business plan for the proposed joint venture and we are committed to delivering the joint venture without the need for compulsory redundancies,” they added. 
“We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with our employee representatives throughout the process of creating the proposed joint venture.”
Last year, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp signed a memorandum of understanding to create an equal joint venture after over a year of negotiations and after Tata Steel reached an agreement with the UK authorities to reduce its UK pension scheme liabilities. 
The non-cash transaction will create Europe’s second largest steel maker and generate pro forma sales of around €15 billion a year, with some 48,000 employees. 
At the time of the announcement, the companies estimated that the deal will generate some €600 million in synergies a year through the integration of research and development, commercial functions and the optimisation of procurement and logistics."

The remarks by Tata Steel Europe's European Works Council (EWC) threaten to further delay a deal to combine Thyssenkrupp's steel operations with Tata's European steel business, a pact which has not been signed because of resistance from Dutch workers.
“The EWC acknowledges there is an industrial rationale for pursuing this joint venture, but with the matters outstanding the EWC remains unconvinced that this partnership with Thyssenkrupp would be in the best interests of the TSE operations and the employees we represent,” it said in a statement."

Erstwhile promoters — Neeraj Singal, Brij Bhushan Singal, Ritu Singal, Aishwarya Singal, Brij Bhushan Singal HUF and Bhushan Infrastructure Pvt Ltd — collectively hold 3.47 per cent of paid-up share capital of BSL.

The acquisition is being financed through a combination of external bridge loan of ₹16,500 crore availed by BNPL and the balance through investment by Tata Steel in BNPL. The bridge loan availed by BNPL is expected to be replaced by debt raised at BSL over time. Incorporated in 1983, BSL is currently fifth largest integrated steel plant with a crude steel capacity of about 5.6 million tonne a year along with downstream facilities of cold rolled products of about 2 mtpa.

Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are close to agreeing terms on a merger that will create Europe's second-biggest steelmaker, after Arcelor Mittal.
According to sources, the deal - which has been under negotiation for more than a year - is likely to be concluded in the next few days. It will see Tata Steel's UK plants merged into a pan-European venture with annual sales of about £13 billion. 
In the revised deal, Thyssenkrupp will own about 55 per cent of the equity in the new company and Tata will have 45 per cent. The changes happened after Thyssenkrupp’s activist shareholders pressured the management to squeeze better terms from the deal, which was originally a 50-50 split. The voting rights will be equally split.
The talks over the joint venture have dragged on for more than a year and faced opposition from labour representatives, as well as activist shareholders. Thyssenkrupp’s labor representatives had said on Thursday they would vote in favour of the joint venture, paving the way for the deal to go through.
Tata Steel stock has risen nearly 17 per cent in 12 months up to Thursday.

94,2018-06-29,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel to be junior partner, post ThyssenKrupp merger 
Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are close to finalising the terms of a long-awaited merger, paving the way for the creation of Europe’s second largest steel company after ArcelorMittal.
The deal is expected to be concluded within days, various British media reported. Tata Steel’s Dutch division has given the merger its support, Reuters reported, while according to Bloomberg, the General Work’s Council of ThyssenKrupp, which once had reservations about the deal, was also on board with the new terms. The terms include Tata Steel taking an approximately 45 per cent stake, and ThyssenKrupp the remaining 55 per cent— a shift from the 50-50 deal initially on the table.
A number of activist investors in ThyssenKrupp had pushed for a reconfiguration of the terms of the deal. Earlier this month, workers at Tata’s European operations flagged concerns around the planned merger, warning that they remained “unconvinced” that the deal represents the best interests of Tata Steel Europe operations and employees. The deal would, therefore, have to address the concerns of unions across the board.
The agreement would put an end to protracted negotiations. In September 2017, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the merger, following the agreement Tata Steel reached with the UK authorities to reach its pension scheme liabilities in the UK.
According to the MoU last year, the merged company would generate pro forma sales of about €15 billion a year, with about 48,000 employees across 34 locations. Any deal is likely to involve further reassurances on the jobs and facilities.
European steel makers have been opting for consolidation to combat the persistent challenges facing the industry. These include overcapacity and pricing, particularly amid the competition from China and beyond. In recent months, US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports has added another dimension – restricting access not just to the US market, but also leading to more products being diverted from elsewhere to Europe.
In May, an ArcelorMittal-led consortium gained the necessary EU regulatory approvals, even though Ilva, a nationalised Italian steel plant, currently awaits handover from Italian authorities."

The long-awaited merger of Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp is set to go ahead, as the two firms signed a definitive agreement for a 50-50 joint venture, creating Europe’s second largest steel company after ArcelorMittal.
The deal was a “strong answer to the challenges in the steel market,” and would create 5 billion euros in additional value to both firms, the companies said. The announcement came after ThyssenKrupp’s supervisory board gave the approval for the deal late on Friday, following a number of concessions to reflect a “valuation gap” that had developed between the two entities. 
The company created in the 50-50 joint venture is to be called ThyssenKrupp Tata Steel and will be managed by a Netherlands based holding company. It will have around 48,000 workers and an estimated 17 billion euros in sales.
Synergies are expected to be in the region of 400 million euros to 500 million euros. The deal included “proper compensation” for the value gap, including the agreement that in the case of an IPO, Thyssenkrupp would receive a higher share of the proceeds, reflecting a 55: 45 ratio in favour of Thyssenkrupp.
Thyssenkrupp would also have the right to “exclusively decide” on the timing of an IPO. A number of activist investors in Thyssenkrupp had pushed for more favourable terms for the company in recent weeks.
""The joint venture will create a strong pan European steel company that is structurally robust and competitive,” said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Steel. “This is a significant milestone for Tata Steel and we remain fully committed to the long-term interest of the joint venture company.
“With the joint venture we create a highly competitive European steel player – based on a strong industrial logic and strategic rationale. This will help secure jobs and value chains in European core industries,” said Heinrich Hiesinger, CEO of Thyssenkrupp.
The joint venture comes as Europe’s steel industry faces new pressures, following the introduction of 25% tariffs on steel imports by the United States on June 1. In addition to hitting sales for European companies to the lucrative, high-value-added US market, the tariffs regime is expected to result in further produce being dumped onto the European market as low cost producing countries such as China struggle to find a market for supplied.
The EU is investigating whether its safeguards regime against dumping is adequate, though a number of other industries -such as the automotive,, and construction sectors – have pushed back against tough measures, arguing it wouldn’t be in the interests of European consumers.
Tata Steel’s UK unions welcomed the deal announcement, including commitments made to the unions that the new venture would result in significant investment across the UK steel business, including a repair of one of Port Talbot’s blast furnaces, and a commitment to avoiding compulsory redundancies till October 2026, and the first £200 million of any operating profit being invested back into the business.
“This venture will only succeed if the necessary strategic investments are made to allow the business to thrive,” said Roy Rickhuss of the Community union. “We will be seeking guarantees over jobs and investment of the UK operations of the joint venture to secure the future of UK steel,” said Tony Brady of the Unite Union.
“For this joint venture to really succeed and to guarantee the longer term future of the plant, and the UK Steel industry, sustained investment in the plant is needed over and above the currently committed work on Blast Furnace 5,” said Stephen Kinnock the MP for Aberavon, where the Port Talbot plant is located."

 Tata Steel Chairman N Chandrasekaran today welcomed the definitive agreement with German steel major Thyssenkrupp to create a new joint venture company as a “historic” development that would strengthen the steel industry across Europe and India.
Chandrasekaran was addressing a joint press conference with Thyssenkrupp CEO Heinrich Hiesinger in Brussels after the creation of Europe’s second-largest steel giant after Lakshmi Mittal’s ArcelorMittal in the form of the new JV company was announced over the weekend.
“For Tata, this marks a significant milestone in the history of Tata Steel and the Tata Group. It strengthens and provides scale to our European operations, creates a strong steel enterprise and also helps the Indian operations to grow and address the needs of the Indian market,” he told reporters.
Addressing a question on what the new company, named Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel BV, would mean for Tata Steel employees in India, he described it as a “great development” for all employees.
“We are structurally strong in India, which offers tremendous opportunities as a growing market. This JV creates an opportunity for us to create a good, strong and sustainable footprint in both geographies,” he said.
Chandrasekaran also asserted Tata Steel’s plans to “double down” in India, where the company plans to increase its presence from 13 million tonnes to 25 million tonnes a year capacity.
In reference to the company’s recent acquisition of Bhushan Steel in India, he indicated that Tata Steel was negotiating another acquisition in India as part of its focus on creating a “strong Indian platform” through Brownfield and Greenfield opportunities.
Tata Steel’s new 50-50 joint venture with Thyssenkrupp involves a total workforce of 48,000 employees, spread across 34 sites, producing about 21 million tonnes of steel a year with revenues of around Euros 15 billion. 
As the second-largest European steel company, after Lakshmi N. Mittal’s ArcelorMittal, the company has forecast cost savings of between 350 million pounds to 440 million pounds a year as it becomes a “one balance sheet” entity.
“There is industrial logic and strategic rationale behind this merger, which creates a new steel champion in Europe We are forming something great, which expresses our trust in the successful future for the steel business in Europe,” said Thyssenkrupp CEO Hiesinger.
The JV will now undergo routine clearance process, with the new company board set to be announced within a few weeks. Both entities expressed confidence in being able to navigate the upheavals in store as a result of ongoing Brexit negotiations and US tariff wars, with Hiesinger expressing hope that a free market context will be maintained for the steel industry.
“Having integrated plants across Europe, gives us some flexibility but we will hope for free flow,” he said. 
“We need to wait and see what the outcome of Brexit is,” added Chandrasekaran.
The definitive agreement signed between the two companies includes a “proper compensation” for a valuation gap between the companies, which means that in case of an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of the JV, Thyssenkrupp will receive a higher share of the proceeds, reflecting an economic ratio of 55/45. Both companies stressed that the timing of the IPO is some way off, as the initial focus would be on kick-starting JV operations following the required regulatory approvals and “building credibility” of the new company.
The merger has been widely welcomed by workers’ unions in Britain as the best solution to ensure the long-term future of Tata Steel’s UK operations. The Indian company owns the UK’s largest steelworks in Port Talbot, South Wales, employing thousands of staff.
“All sides of the JV will have appropriate support to prosper and progress under the new enterprise,” said Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer of Tata Steel.
The new company’s complete production network is to be reviewed starting in 2020, with the aim of integrating and optimising the production strategy for the entire joint venture. 
Until the JV gets all its clearances, Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe and Tata Steel in Europe still operate as separate companies and as competitors."

ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel were providing the “perfect” answer to the challenges facing the European steel industry through the creation of a new “steel champion,” said ThyssenKrupp CEO Heinrich Hiesinger.
The top management of both companies gathered in Brussels following Saturday’s signing of a definitive agreement for a 50:50 joint venture that combines their European steel businesses, creating Europe’s largest steel maker after ArcelorMittal.
“Competitiveness is what we want to achieve,” said Hiesinger, as he pointed to the pressures on the industry in Europe and beyond. “Supply and demand in Europe don’t match. We have significant overcapacity in Europe and worldwide which puts tremendous pressure on the industry,” he said also pointing to the recently introduced US tariff regime that he said threatened jobs in Europe.
In addition to strengthening and providing scale to European operations, the deal allowed Tata Steel’s Indian operations to grow, said Tata Steel Chairman N. Chandrasekaran. “This will create strong structurally competitive organisations: one in India and one in Europe….The joint venture made sense two years ago and it makes tremendous sense two years later.” The companies had both stressed their long-term commitment to the European venture, with an agreement to maintain a majority holding between them for at least six years, he added.
He said the Indian market now had “tremendous” opportunity. “We are going do double down…our intention is to increase our presence in India from 13 million tonnes capacity to around 25 million tonnes capacity,” he said. “The European entity becomes stronger so we can focus on creating a stronger Indian platform.”
The signing of the agreement, comes two years after the companies’ official announcement that they were in talks to merge their European steel operations. The subsequent period involved intense negotiations by Tata Steel with UK authorities to successfully offload their UK pension liabilities. Last minute objections by several ThyssenKrupp investors over the deal – focussed on recent performance of Tata Steel’s European operations and the assets’ consequent valuation – had also threatened to put a spanner in the works.
“You can’t let two quarters decide the valuation of a company,” said TV Narendran, Managing Director of Tata Steel, told this paper, pointing to the investment into upgrading facilities in the Netherlands that had hit recent profitability. ThyssenKrupp’s CFO Guido Kerkhoff also defended the deal, pointing to the 55-45 IPO agreement as offering the “appropriate solution,” for the shifting circumstances.
Under the agreement, in the event of an IPO ThyssenKrupp would receive a 55 per cent share of the proceeds, while Tata Steel would receive 45 per cent. The initiation and timing of any IPO will also be decided by ThyssenKrupp.
Kerkhoff also pointed to the €5 billion in additional value the companies estimated would be created through the 50:50 joint venture.
It was important for the closure of the deal and for the joint venture to build credibility before talk of an IPO ,said Chandrasekaran. Hiesinger said that while the company was currently focussing on closing the deal and harvesting the synergies, there were a number of factors that would be decisive for an IPO, including industrial logic, creating value for shareholders, a secure future for the workforce, and being in keeping with the companies’ culture and heritage.
Headcount reduction
The executives confirmed a headcount reduction of around 4,000, split evenly between the two divisions, which were reflected in consultation agreements with workers. “For the majority of 40,000 employees, this is more secure but we were very honest from the beginning. In order to gain synergies, we cannot avoid that in some locations,” said Hiesinger. Details would be firmed after the deal was closed, he said.
Executives on both sides expressed confidence around their talks with European Commission authorities, over the necessary regulatory approvals. “We cannot judge the process of the European Commission – we have to respect that process. We believe they will act professionally,” said Hiesinger. Regulators were aware of the situation of the steel market and the need for a solution, said Chandrasekaran.
While Chandrasekaran expressed his “strong commitment to the idea of the European Union,” he said it was too early to comment on the impact that Brexit would have on the business. “What kind of form and shape it takes is something we have to watch carefully.”
Hiesinger said that while they hoped for a free market, the fact the joint venture had integrated plants in the UK, Netherlands and Germany made the companies “very flexible” to find an “appropriate solution.”"

As senior executives of Tata Steel and German steel maker ThyssenKrupp gathered in Brussels for the formal signing of the joint venture for their European steel operations, TV Narendran, Managing Director of Tata Steel, spoke to this paper about the logic of the deal, why the valuation of the deal – including a 45-55 split in the event of an IPO – was the right one, whether the 2007 investment into Corus assets had been the right one for the company, and why the impact of the US tariffs has so far been less severe on US sales of Tata Steel’s European operations than envisaged.
What does the deal with ThyssenKrupp mean for Tata Steel?
From a Tata Steel point of view, we have been trying to create strong and sustainable businesses. In India, we have always been structurally strong but we have not had the size. In Europe, we’ve had the size but not the structural strength. So, what we’ve been doing in past few years is grow in India to a size and scale that is important to have in India, which is a growing market, and to have a business in Europe that is structurally strong. I think the partnership and joint venture with Thyssen helps us create that. The kind of investment that Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp have made into technology sets us up to service the customer well here as customers here expect us to be at the cutting edge as far as technology is concerned. It’s a tough industry so you need to have sustainable businesses
How satisfied are you with the terms of the agreement: including the 45: 55 split in the event of an IPO?
It was difficult. ThyssenKrupp had its own pressures and they have shareholders who were demanding a relook. Our point of view was that you can’t let two quarters decide the valuation of a company. One of the reasons we didn’t have great quarters in the last two was that we were carrying out significant investments particularly in the Netherlands, to upgrade facilities there. The operating team in ThyssenKrupp understood that and this was a good solution where you keep it at 50:50 but you are given warrants which they can encash which are triggered only when you do an IPO. You have something in hand which is not going against the structure or philosophy of the joint venture.
Under the terms of the agreement, ThyssenKrupp will decide on an IPO but what criteria would be used to determine its timing?
When you do an IPO you want the business to be on a strong footing. ThyssenKrupp has the right to decide on timing but the timing will depend on how quickly we can realise the synergies and get the right value from the market.
 What will be key to the success of the joint venture?
The synergies are very significant [€400-500 million annually) – we have detailed plans for those plans and we are on track on that. With this joint venture we have two of the best sites in Europe – Port Talbot has structural challenges which are nothing to do with the people but inherent in the site but we are well positioned. We have a strong franchise. We have to make sure the integration happens well. We are conscious that we have multiple cultures coming on board but we have done this before.
We believe it’s the right time in the European market: conditions have returned in terms of steel demand, which is positive. The countries that have struggled the most like Spain are starting to do quite well so the conditions are ideal. Globally, steel demand is also getting better: all major steel consuming countries are growing. We are coming together at the right time to make this a success.
How are the US steel tariffs impacting European business?
In terms of direct exports to the US, the pain is not as much as we had feared because many of the customers in the US don’t have any other option but to buy the steel we send to them. 
So particularly for the packaging industry they have given us the price increases that are required to cover the cost of higher tariffs. I feel in some sense the US customers are paying a higher price for it than globally what customers are paying. If you look at the hot rolled coil prices in the US today it is on a metric ton basis 25 to 30 per cent higher than it is in the rest of the world.
We are less concerned about what we are selling into the US. We are more concerned about what could come our way because the US has introduced these measures.
How will Brexit shape the joint venture?
We have a strong footprint in the continent and a significant position in the UK so we are well positioned: if the UK closes up we have a footprint there, if it doesn’t it is as it is today. If I look at Tata Steel Europe we are 10 million (tonnes) and 3 million in the UK so that is less than 30 per cent of production. If you look at the joint venture we have 22 million, 3 million of which is in the UK so the joint venture is less vulnerable to what happens in the UK. Structurally you become stronger as a joint venture than as Tata Steel Europe. The risk is there but it could also be an opportunity. It depends on which way the pound moves, and what the negotiate. We sell into Spain and the southern European markets from the UK. The UK footprint is much smaller than it once was: Port Talbot is a single site operation: what is let for us in the UK can be defended better. The UK business has gone from being EBITDA negative to EBITDA positive. So it’s a problem to solve rather than a crisis it was two years back.
It’s been a tough road since the 2007 acquisition of Corus -what have been the learning points for the group?
The first year of course was great but the crisis was obviously something that no one anticipated- either the severity or intensity of the crisis. European steel demand did not recover for 10 years. It was a unique set of circumstances: a lot of things we thought would go right went wrong but to me what we did was we worked very hard over the past ten years, and we didn’t give up. We had the restructuring of our businesses and sold some of them and took some tough calls. 
Our people in Europe worked very hard and we grew in India. When we acquired Corus we were 4 million (tonnes a year) in India and 18 million here so most of the capital was invested here. Over the past ten years as we’ve gone about restructuring Europe and reduced Tata Steel’s European footprint from 18 to 10 million, in India we’ve grown from 4 to 13 million so as a consolidated company we are in a much stronger position today and this continues. 13 million in India is going to become 25 or 26 million in the next five years and in Europe we’ve created a 22 million entity. The learnings for us in our industry is how important it is to be structurally strong: you have to be the last man standing. We always had the position to be the last man standing in India and by creating this footprint in mature markets we have the same. It’s not about top line growth but about a consolidated enterprise that has the resources to invest in technology, in upgrading facilities.
How has the European business benefited India? 
One of the reasons for coming into Europe is that there are a lot of learnings from sophisticated mature markets that we can take back to emerging and growing markets. It helps to give us a preview of what to expect in Indian markets - having an insight into mature markets helps us plan better: many products that are developed here have also been developed or are being developed in India.
Was the 2007 acquisition the right step for Tata Steel?
At the time it was the right decision. You must think of what was happening in the industry, it was consolidating very rapidly. Had we known there was going to be a global financial crisis 12 months down the road I don’t know what we would have done. Everyone would have sat on capital at the time rather than spend it. In our industry, it is important to make a call. There is never a perfect time but I think we have the confidence to have outlasted many difficult cycles and we will continue to deal with them."

Forging ties The merger between the two steel mergers has been fraught with uncertainty

Forging ties The merger between the two steel mergers has been fraught with uncertainty
   -  ayzek


Earlier this week, top executives at Tata Steel and German industrial conglomerate ThyssenKrupp gathered in Brussels to mark the long-awaited merger of their European steel assets – spread across Germany, the Netherlands and Britain – to create a new “steel champion”. 
The route to the merger — talks on which became public in 2016 — have been drawn-out, heated, and even riven with uncertainty. First the talks centred on Tata Steel’s ability to offload its UK pension liabilities — separating the company’s costly £15-billion British Steel Pension Scheme was seen as a make or break moment for the potential merger. The company achieved this with a £550- million payment to the scheme, and issuing the pension’s trustee with a 33 per cent stake in Tata Steel UK. 
Union concerns on company commitments to jobs and maintenance of facilities (particularly a blast furnace at Tata Steel’s Port Talbot plant) also persisted, while in the last few weeks, activist investors at ThyssenKrupp threw in another potential spanner, raising concerns that given a recent dip in profitability at Tata Steel’s European operations, the deal was stacked too favourably in Tata’s favour. 
Nevertheless, the agreement was reached, and gained ThyssenKrupp’s strategy board approval within the first half of 2018 as the companies had estimated. While still a 50:50 merger, should an IPO occur, proceeds would be allocated on a 55:45 per cent basis in favour of ThyssenKrupp — an arrangement that both firms insisted kept to the “structure” and “philosophy” of the joint venture.
The Tata Steel-ThyssenKrupp agreement, as it stands, involves compromise by all sides. Up to 4,000 jobs, split roughly between the two companies — will go from the 48,000-employee strong joint entity. But in agreements struck with unions in the UK there will be no compulsory redundancies until 2026 and a commitment to spending millions on one of the blast furnaces at Port Talbot whose future had looked uncertain. 
Tata Steel, while standing firm against investor efforts to rejig the deal entirely, gave ground to ThyssenKrupp through the IPO arrangements that would also give the German firm say over the timing of any IPO. Defending the deal against its critics, ThyssenKrupp CEO Heinrich Hiesinger pointed out that without the deal there would be no estimated €5 billion in additional value to both firms created (the companies estimate annual synergies will amount to €4-500 million). However, on Thursday he offered his resignation to the board to enable a “fundamental discussion” within the board on the company’s future.
Much work of course remains to be done: the venture is yet to gain the approval of Europe’s Competition Commission, discussions with which are commenced. While insisting they had to respect the commission’s processes, the firms appeared confident about this aspect — noting that conversations with the regulator had been going on over the past two years, during the course of which asset sales by the companies had taken place. 
In recent months, the commission’s actions have also suggested that it is aware of the pressures facing the European steel industry. Clearing ArcelorMittal’s acquisition of Ilva, owner of Europe’s largest steel flat carbon steel plant based in Taranto, Italy, the commission acknowledged the industry’s problems in Europe, including the “unfair” dumping of produce on the UK market, and the potential impact of US import restrictions on steel.
Raising barriers
On Thursday, Reuters reported that European nations voted overwhelmingly (25 in favour with 3 abstentions) to support European Commission proposals to introduce a mixture of tariffs and quotas as trade defence measures to limit the impact of the US tariffs under Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act. The Commission has had to balance competing lobbying from the steel sector on the one hand — and on the other some industries in Europe which have been arguing against steel safeguard measures. Last month the European Automobile Manufacturers Association wrote to the Commission arguing the measures weren’t in Europe’s interests, as they put downstream users under pressure.
Even as they await the competition authority’s go-ahead, the onus on the deal has shifted very much towards national policy makers. Governments have proved surprisingly obstructive to change. Late last month, the Italian government postponed a decision on handing over Ilva to ArcelorMittal from early July to later this year.
While less directly obstructive, the British government too has faced criticism from industry, unions and politicians, over the lack of a solid strategy to support the domestic steel industry — including the sealing of a long-awaited sector deal that would involve commitments from the government, and industry. 
The significance of a sector deal — which covers the UK’s main steel producers and includes industry pledges for significant new capital investment (including in R&D), — was stressed by a major steel conference organised by the Community union in northern England earlier this year, which also pointed to other very UK-specific challenges, including energy prices, which are among the highest for the energy-intensive industry in Europe.
“The Westminster government must end the delays and bring forward the sector deal for steel, and the Welsh government must to show its commitment to the industry too with tangible support,” said Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community Union in the UK, as the union on Wednesday officially endorsed the joint venture arrangements. “It’s now time for the UK government to step up and back the sector deal for steel and follow through on its promises on energy costs and procurement,” said Stephen Kinnock, the MP for the Port Talbot region of Aberavon. 
The Brexit factor
There is of course also further uncertainty about the implications of Brexit — not just on potential tariffs and the costs of trading with Europe, but also Britain’s ability to protect its industry. Earlier this year, the steel industry raised concerns that post-Brexit trade legislation might not defend steel companies adequately and could water down the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures that the EU had put in place. 
The good news is that ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel have inured themselves somewhat to the vagaries of individual markets: from around a third of Tata Steel’s European operations, Britain will now just account for three out of 22 million tonnes of steel produced by the joint group."

 The CEO of German industrial giant Thyssenkrupp on Thursday announced his resignation, just days after he hailed the “historic” merger of the company’s steelmaking business with Tata Steel.
In a move that came as a surprise, the company announced that Heinrich Hiesinger has asked the Supervisory Board of the company to end his mandate as Chief Executive Officer of Thyssenkrupp AG “in mutual agreement”.
Hiesinger said: “Today [Thursday] I informed the Supervisory Board that I would like to step down from my position as CEO of Thyssenkrupp. I take this step very consciously to enable a fundamental discussion in the Supervisory Board on the future of Thyssenkrupp. 
A joint understanding of Board and Supervisory Board on the strategic direction of a company is a key pre-requisite for successfully leading a company, he said.
He added: “The joint venture of our steel activities with Tata is the next significant step to turn Thyssenkrupp into a strong industrial company. We can be proud of what we achieved until now. For this I would like to thank all employees. They are the most valuable capital of Thyssenkrupp. ""
Tata Steel’s 50-50 joint venture with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp has created Europe’s second-largest steel company after Lakshmi Mittal’s ArcelorMittal.
The JV combines the European steel businesses of the Indian steel major with the German firm to create Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel BV. The new steel company will have a total workforce of 48,000 employees spread across 34 sites.
Prof Ulrich Lehner, chairman of the supervisory board, praised the outgoing CEO and said that the Board, under the leadership of Hiesinger, has freed Thyssenkrupp from an existential crisis and made the company ready for the future by implementing the strategy which was agreed by the Supervisory Board. 
""Without Heinrich Hiesinger there would be no Thyssenkrupp today. I am deeply grateful for what he achieved and especially for how he achieved this: intelligent, modest, consistent; with far-sightedness and social responsibility and always in the interest of our customers, employees and shareholders,"" he said.
The Supervisory Board will meet tomorrow to discuss and decide on the request of Heinrich Hiesinger, Thyssenkrupp said."

 Less than a week after defending the deal to merge European steel assets with Tata Steel, ThyssenKrupp CEO Heinrich Hiesinger is to step down from his position after the company’s supervisory board accepted his resignation. 
The company will be led by the board until a suitable successor can be found, the company said on Friday. ”In this tough situation for the company, it is now initially about staying the course,” said Chairman of the Supervisory board Ulrich Lehrer.
Hiesinger has led ThyssenKrupp – a large German industrial conglomerate — over the past seven years, attempting to reshape its focus, away from steel, to which the merger with Tata Steel was seen as key. However, in recent week’s management’s unwillingness to push for more favourable terms because of recent tough quarters for Tata Steel’s European assets brought them criticism from leading activist shareholders. 
Hiesinger defended the terms – which included an agreement that in the event of an IPO 55 per cent of the proceeds would go to ThyssenKrupp, which alone would be determine if and when the process could commence. Tata Steel had also insisted the deal was structured as best it could – acknowledging changing circumstances while not changing the fundamental philosophy of the deal. 
“Our point of view was that you can’t let two quarters decide the valuation of a company,” said TV Narendran, Managing Director, Tata Steel, told this paper.
“I take this step very consciously to enable a fundamental discussion in the Supervisor Board on the future of ThyssenKrupp,” said Hiesinger on Thursday as he asked for his resignation to be accepted."
84,2018-07-08,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel-thyssenkrupp deal: Gaining stability
 As part of the restructuring process of its loss-making European operations, Tata Steel has recently signed a definitive agreement (non-cash deal) with thyssenkrupp AG (tk) to form a 50:50 joint venture (JV). 
The JV combines the flat steel businesses of both companies to form Europe’s second-largest flat steel company (behind Arcelor Mittal), with expected 21.3 million tonnes of shipments.
Since September 2017 (when the MoU was signed), while tk’s steel business has improved, profitability at Tata Steel’s European operations has weakened. 
Under pressure from tk’s shareholders to alter the terms of the agreement, the deal has been tweaked a bit. 
The new terms provide assurance to tk — in case an IPO of the newly-formed entity goes through, it will get a higher share of the proceeds, reflecting an economic interest between tk and Tata Steel in the ratio of 55:45. It is to be noted that the deal is subject to approval from the European Commission — expected by the end of this calendar year.
Here we highlight the implications of the new deal for Tata Steel shareholders.
Better off
Though the European operations contribute nearly 45-50 per cent to the consolidated revenue of the Tata Steel group, it has been at the cost of profitability.
In FY-18 too, the performance has been weak due to subdued demand, high levels of imports and restructuring activities. 
Though sales were marginally higher, operating profit of Tata Steel Europe has reduced by 19 per cent to ₹3,792 crore. Also, net losses (before exceptional items) have nearly trebled from ₹762 crore to ₹2,164 crore. 
The net worth of the European business, as of FY-18-ending (prior to restructuring), was negative, while that of the Tata Steel group was about ₹60,870 crore. 
At this juncture, spinning off the European operations from the group means that the profits earned in India would remain and not get eroded after consolidation. 
Besides, this restructuring de-consolidates ₹20,000 crore debt from the consolidated books of Tata Steel that will lighten its balance sheet to some extent.
The thyssenkrupp Tata Steel BV — the new JV company — is expected to generate sales of €17 billion and achieve annual synergies of €400-500 million, through joint purchasing, shared logistics services, higher equipment utilisation and reduced administrative expenses. 
The estimated operating profit after considering the synergy benefits is around €2 billion per annum or about ₹16,000 crore — likely to be achieved after two to three years. 
This increases the profit contribution from the European operations to Tata Steel, which will receive dividends.
Compensatory tweaks
Sales from Tata Steel Europe and tk in the year to March 2018 were about €7.9 billion and €8.9 billion, respectively. The average operating profit margin of the former was about 6 per cent, about half the latter’s levels.
Tata Steel will be entitled to equal board representation and dividends.
 A new clause added is that it is at tk’s discretion to decide on the timing of an IPO and that it would get an extra 10 per cent proceeds from the offer. This additional amount is the compensation for better operational performance of the company."

   -  Reuters


 The chairman of Germany's Thyssenkrupp has resigned, following the company's chief executive under pressure from activist shareholders demanding a radical restructuring of the embattled industrial conglomerate.
Ulrich Lehner's departure on Monday deepens a leadership vacuum at the submarines-to-elevators group, with Guido Kerkhoff having barely settled in as acting CEO after Heinrich Hiesinger quit 10 days ago.
Lehner told the executive board that he would resign with effect from July 31 and that he would withdraw from the supervisory board, Thyssenkrupp said in a statement, adding that a successor would be selected soon.
‘Break-up of company not an option’
The 72-year-old executive said he no longer enjoyed sufficient support to develop the company in the interest of its customers, employees and shareholders.
“I take this step consciously to enable a fundamental discussion with our shareholders on the future of Thyssenkrupp,” Lehner said in a statement.
“A break-up of the company and the related loss of many jobs is not an option.”
Hiesinger had championed a European merger of Thyssenkrupp's steel interests with those of Tata Steel, sealed on June 30, as a key plank of his strategy to revive the company's business fortunes and share price.
He quit after failing to win unanimous shareholder backing for the Tata deal, which was two years in the making and when finally signed proved to be less advantageous for Thyssenkrupp than some investors had hoped.
Turmoil at the top
The leadership turmoil at Thyssenkrupp, which has a history stretching back over two centuries, has opened up more fundamental questions about a company that was long run not only for profit, but also with the aims of upholding the legacy of its founding family and preserving jobs for its 158,000 workers.
“I respect Lehner's decision, but I regret it,” said Wilhelm Segerath, head of the Thyssenkrupp works council and a senior official in the IG Metall industrial trade union.
Segerath called on the main shareholders to work together to develop Thyssenkrupp. “There can be no break-up of the business,” he told Reuters.
Unlocking value
Lehner, who served on the supervisory board for a decade and became chairman in 2013, was a nominee of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation that is the company's largest shareholder with a 21 per cent stake.
The Krupp foundation was created in the 1960s on the initiative of Berthold Beitz, who as a manager was instrumental in the company's post-war success and later a prime mover behind a 1999 merger that created Thyssenkrupp. He died in 2013.
The trustees of the foundation, which include North Rhine-Westphalia's chief minister Armin Laschet, have faced criticism for failing to steady the ship after activist investors Cevian and Elliott demanded an across-the-board strategy review.
Sweden's Cevian, which holds an 18 per cent stake in Thyssenkrupp, and Elliott see the potential to unlock value with more far-reaching changes than Hiesinger was prepared to make. During the seven-year term of the former Siemens manager, the Thyssenkrupp share price declined by 28 per cent.
In talks with Kone for elevator biz merger
One newspaper reported at the weekend that the chair of the Krupp foundation had held talks with the largest shareholder of Kone on a potential merger of the two companies' elevator businesses.
The first conversations took place as early as two years ago but the idea was rebuffed by Hiesinger, who wanted to hold on to one of Thyssenkrupp's most profitable divisions, Handelsblatt reported.
It wasn't immediately clear whether the successive departures of Hiesinger and Lehner would open the way for more radical steps on strategy. Cevian and Elliott declined to comment, while the Krupp foundation could not be reached for comment.
“The executive board regrets the resignation of Ulrich Lehner and thanks him for the trustful collaboration,” acting CEO Kerkhoff said in the company's statement.
“With his calm and reliable leadership of the supervisory board he reconciled the interests of shareholders and employees at all times.”"
79,2018-07-20,Tata Steel,"NCLAT allows lenders to meet and finalise Bhushan Power bid 
 The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) today gave a go-ahead to the lenders’ meeting of debt-ridden Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL), directing it to finalise a bid for the company.
Vacating its earlier stay, the appellate tribunal has directed the committee of creditors (CoC) of the company to consider the resolution plans submitted by three firms -- Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW Steel.
NCLAT has also directed the CoC to call all the three bidders, along with operational creditors and the suspended board of directors, to the meeting. The CoC would call for an urgent meeting to take the resolution plan for discussion and approval, said a two-member bench headed by Chairman Justice S. J. Mukhopadhaya.
He further said, “The resolution professional (RP), after consulting CoC, will invite operational creditors and all three resolution applicants will remain present on the date of consideration of the resolution plan.”
The suspended board of directors is also allowed to attend the meetings, in which resolution plan will be considered by CoC, NCLAT said in its orders.
Earlier, on July 17, NCLAT had stayed the meeting of the CoC when they were to vote for finalisation of the highest bidder (H1) for BPSL. 
The best of the three plans, which are in consonance with Section 30(2) and are viable, feasible and acceptable to the majority of the CoC be voted on the same or subsequent date to approve, said NCLAT.
It further said, “The CoC may also indicate the second best plan (H2) so that in future the adjudicating authority can approve in case of any problems with the first resolution plan.”
The appellate tribunal further said that CoC will place the selected resolution plan before the adjudicating authority, which may approve it, but they will not give effect without prior approval of this tribunal (NCLAT). 
Today, during the proceedings of the appellate tribunal, the RP tendered an unconditional apology. However, NCLAT said it would hear it whenever the date comes. The appellate tribunal has directed listing of the matter on August 1 for next hearing.
During the last hearing on July 17, NCLAT had pulled up the RP of the company, Mahendra Kumar Khandelwal, for not following its previous orders to allow the representatives of operational creditors to attend the meeting.
It had said it would consider whether contempt of court proceedings should be initiated against the RP in the next hearing, which was today. In the last hearing, operational creditors of the company had alleged that their representatives were not allowed to attend the CoC meeting.
Moreover, Liberty House, a resolution applicant, has alleged that information was not supplied about the meeting and on July 11 RP gave a 19-page checklist seeking the company’s compliance on 29 A of Insovency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
Earlier, the company’s lenders had rejected the resolution plan submitted by Liberty House citing a delay, following which the UK-based group had moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
The NCLT had on April 23 directed BPSL’s lenders, led by PNB, to consider the bid submitted by Liberty House. This order was later challenged by Tata Steel, another resolution applicant of BPSL, before NCLAT -- the appellate tribunal."

Tata Steel is the process of shutting down its subsidiary Tayo Rolls in Jamshedpur and sell off some of its assets in South-East Asia to have a leaner structure and trim debt.
Tayo Rolls is a joint venture with Japan-based Yodogawa Steel promoted in 1968. Based out of Jamshedpur, Tayo is into cast rolls, forged rolls, special castings and pig iron. It has not registered any revenue for the last two financial years.
Tata Steel’s operations in South-East Asia started in 2004 with the acquisition of NatSteel, Singapore. In 2006, it acquired Thailand-based steelmaker Millennium Steel to strengthen its operations.
Answering a shareholder's question at the company's 111th AGM on Friday, N Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Steel, said the company is looking to sell sub-scale and non-core asset to simplify the structure.
The operations of Tayo Rolls, which were suspended some time back, is in the process of closure, he added.
Tata Steel is also in an advanced stage of hiving off its European asset into a 50:50 joint venture with ThyssenKrupp. 
At the time of an initial public offering later ThyssenKrupp will increase its stake to 55 per cent, said Koushik Chatterjee, Chief Financial Officer, Tata Steel.
Allaying shareholders’ concern on high debt, Chandrasekaran said the net debt has gone up from ₹69,215 crore to ₹85,000 crore after the acquisition of Bhushan Steel, but it will come down by ₹20,000 crore once the ThyssenKrupp joint venture is finalised.
On Friday, Tata Steel had sought shareholders’ approval to raise ₹12,000 crore through private placement of non-convertible debentures.
Dwelling on Bhushan Steel acquisition, TV Narendran, Managing Director, Tata Steel, said the experience with the newly acquired asset has been satisfactory for the last 45 days and fund infusion into the company will enable a quicker turnaround.
After completion of the joint venture with Thhyssenkrupp and acquisition in India, the group's total steel capacity will be about 23 million tonnes per annum, he said."
77,2018-07-20,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel may invest ₹5,000 cr to develop Subarnarekha port
 In what could emerge as an important port on India’s East coast, Tata Steel plans to develop the Subarnarekha port at the northern-most tip of Odisha, where the river Subarnarekha merges with the Bay of Bengal. 
The port, with the ability to manage large-sized ships, will be developed at a cost of ₹4,000-5,000 crore in three to four years, said an industry source privy to the matter.
The precise location in north Odisha will allow the Subarnarekha port immediate proximity to West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, and even Nepal.
The port is likely to have the potential to handle large ships with 180,000 dead weight tonnage capacity with 18-metre draft that will help Tata Steel lower its transport and product costs.
Other ports in the vicinity have lower drafts — Dhamra has a draft of 17.2 m, Haldia 7.5 m and Paradip ports 14.5 m. “To achieve the required depth, a navigation channel, which will be longer than at Dhamra, will have to be dredged. However, in comparison to Haldia, which is a riverine port, the siltation in the channel will be negligible here,” said an industry source requesting anonymity. 
The port will also need a rail-link of around 50 km. The rail distance from Subarnarekha to Tata Steel’s Jamshedpur plant is around 270 km, about 100 km shorter than from Dhamra port, which is 374 km. The savings in terms of rail freight for imported raw materials will work out in the range of ₹150-250 per tonne.
“During the first phase, the plan is to build 3-4 berths with a handling capacity of 20-25 mt, which can handle dry bulk cargo like coal, iron ore and limestone, and other general cargo like steel,” the source said. In subsequent phases, the port can be expanded to handle containers, liquid bulk cargo and LNG/LPG as per market demand. 
The port can also provide closer access to Chittagong port, Bangladesh, in future for transhipment of containers. Tata Steel, which has already announced plans to buy a majority stake in the port, holds a 7 per cent stake now.
Cargo handling
As of now, Dhamra port, which is closest to Tata’s Kalinganagar steel plant, the handles majority of its cargo. Paradip port has been historically handling almost 90 per cent of the cargo for Bhushan Steel, which has been acquired by Tatas. Paradip and Dhamra also handle cargo for the Jamshedpur plant.
Steel plants require coking coal as an input, which are imported from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand to ports and then transported by rail to the plants. The output — steel — is moved across the country largely by rail and road, with some steel being moved along the coastal routes as well. 
But handling steel along the river route — through the Subarnarekha, which originates from Ranchi in Jharkhand and meets the Bay of Bengal in Balasore district of Odisha — requires the development of good infrastructure.
Tata Steel had announced that it would acquire a majority equity stake in Creative Port Development Pvt Ltd (CPDPL). Promoted by two IITians, Ramani Ramaswamy and Ramaswamy Rangarajan, CPDPL specialises in developing ports, and holds the rights to develop the Subarnarekhaport on a build-own-operate-share-and-transfer basis from the Odisha government.
The port development is envisaged through a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, called Subarnarekha Port Pvt Ltd. 
The port has received all the requisite clearances including a no-objection-certificate from the Defence Ministry and has been allotted around 700 acres of land by the State government."

 Shares of Tata Steel Ltd jumped as much as 2.2 per cent to highest since July 16. According to technicals, the stock may have ended a corrective cycle that started in late January.
The stock's wave pattern suggests the final wave E of a corrective cycle had ended on July 19 and is in the first wave of a five-wave uptrend. Tata Steel stock has broken above a resistance at Rs 535.05, the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the uptrend from February 12, 2016 low to January 31, 2018 high.
The stock is closer to its upper trend line, a break above which will confirm the end of a correction and may lead to price rise up to the next resistance at Rs 616.4, the 23.6 per cent level. MACD has cut above its signal line, seen as a positive sign.
Tata Steel stock had fallen 19.2 per cent this year as of last close, while the broader NSE Index was up 6.1 per cent in the same period."
73,2018-08-14,Tata Steel,"JSW pips Tata Steel to bag Bhushan Power 
JSW Steel has pipped Tata Steel at the post to emerge as the highest bidder for the stressed Bhushan Power and Steel.
JSW Steel revised its bid from the earlier ₹19,000 crore to ₹19,700 crore on Monday, while Tata Steel surprisingly retained its initial bid of ₹17,000 crore. UK-headquartered Liberty House increased its bid by ₹500 crore to ₹19,000 crore, said sources close to the development.
Tata Steel had emerged the winner in the first round of bidding. But the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) directed Bhushan Power’s Committee of Creditors (CoC) to go for rebids after the other firms expressed a wish to increase their offers.
Tata Steel’s move
Tata Steel had appealed to the Supreme Court against the NCLAT decision to consider revised bids. However, the apex court refused to stay the NCLAT order.
The CoC will now submit the leading bids — of JSW Steel and Liberty House — to NCLAT, which will then approve the highest bidder’s proposal on August 17.
JSW Steel has also provided SBI’s guarantee to fund the acquisition.
With the buyout of Bhushan Power, JSW Steel will retain its position as the country’s largest private sector steel producer with a capacity of 22 mtpa while Tata Steel, with a capacity of 19 mtpa, will remain the second largest.
Tata Steel had earlier acquired Bhushan Steel through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process.
Stiff competition
JSW can now enhance Bhushan Power’s capacity quickly to 5 mtpa from 3.5 mtpa with an investment of ₹1,500 crore.
The gap between JSW Steel and Tata Steel will remain more or less the same even after the fresh capacity addition comes on stream over the next 5-8 years, according to industry experts.
Tata Steel had beaten JSW Steel to bag the 5 mtpa capacity Bhushan Steel with its bid of ₹35,000 crore. On the other hand, JSW Steel had bagged Monnet Ispat and Power for ₹2,800 crore.
Bhushan Power and Steel is a producer of flat and long steel products, with plants located in Chandigarh, Derabassi, Kolkata and Odisha."

72,2018-09-02,Tata Steel,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (₹308.8)








 
SBI inched higher in the initial part of the week and then remained range-bound for the rest of the week. The stock closed 2.8 per cent higher for the week. Though the daily candle chart gives a mixed outlook, the weekly chart is bullish. A key near-term resistance is at ₹312. Inability to breach this hurdle and a subsequent fall below ₹303 — the 21-day moving average support — can drag the stock lower to ₹290 in the short term. But the downside is likely to be limited as a break below the ₹290-285 support cluster is unlikely. On the other hand, if SBI manages to break above ₹312, an up-move to ₹320 can be seen. The level of ₹320 is a key short-term resistance. A strong break and a decisive close above this hurdle will boost the momentum. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹350 or even ₹370 over the medium term. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions. Retain the stop-loss at ₹283. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹318.
 
ITC (₹319.1)








 
The uptrend in ITC remains intact and is gaining momentum. The stock surged 2.8 per cent last week and closed at a key resistance level of ₹319. A pull-back in the initial part of the week can take the stock lower to ₹315 or ₹312. But further fall below ₹312 looks unlikely at the moment. The levels of ₹312 and ₹307 are significant supports for ITC, which are likely to limit the downside in the short term. A bounce back from either ₹315 or ₹312 will increase the likelihood of the stock breaking above ₹319 decisively. Such a break can take ITC higher to ₹327 — the next crucial resistance level. As mentioned last week, a strong break above ₹327 will give the stock fresh momentum. In such a scenario, ITC will gear up for a fresh rally to ₹360 over the medium term. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Short-term traders who have taken long positions at ₹297 can hold with a stop-loss at ₹303. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹308 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹321. Book profits at ₹330.
 
 
Infosys (₹1,440)








 
Infosys surged over 4 per cent last week. The 21-day moving average is continuing to provide strong support. This support has been limiting the downside in the stock consistently since April. Immediate resistance is in the ₹1,447-1,450 region. Inability to breach ₹1,450 can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹1,400 or ₹1,390. But a strong break above ₹1,450 can take Infosys higher to ₹1,490 or ₹1,500. The region between ₹1,490 and ₹1,500 is a key resistance. A corrective fall after testing this resistance region cannot be ruled out. Long-term investors can book partial profits at ₹1,480 and keep the stop-loss for the rest of the holdings at ₹1,360. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions, retain the stop-loss at ₹1,360 and book profits at $1,485. The uptrend in Infosys will come under threat only if it declines below the 21-day moving average (₹1,393) support decisively. Such a break will trigger a fall to ₹1,350 . Further break below ₹1,350 can then drag the stock to ₹1,320 or even lower thereafter.
 
 
RIL (₹1,240.9)








 
RIL began the week on a positive note and surged about 4 per cent intra-week to record a high of ₹1,328. However, the stock lost momentum and reversed sharply lower, giving back all the gains made and closed 3 per cent lower for the week. The near-term outlook is negative. Resistance is around ₹1,280. As long as the stock remains below ₹1,280, the possibility of the stock breaking below ₹1,229 — the 21-day moving average — is high. Such a break can take RIL lower to ₹1,210 initially. A strong break below ₹1,210 will turn the outlook to negative. In such a scenario, a sharp fall to ₹1,160 or even lower levels is possible on the back of profit-booking. On the other hand, if RIL manages to reverse higher from the immediate support levels of ₹1,229 or ₹1,210, the downside pressure may ease. A bounce-back move to ₹1,260 or ₹1,270 is possible in that case. A decisive break and close above ₹1,270 will bring back the bullish momentum. It will then increase the possibility of the stock revisiting ₹1,300 and ₹1,320.
 
 
Tata Steel (₹601.6)








 
Tata Steel surged 4.6 per cent last week, recovering all the loss made in the earlier week. With this up-move, the stock has regained its strength. Support is in the ₹593-₹590 region, which is likely to limit the downside in the near term. A break below ₹590 can drag the stock lower to ₹570 or ₹565. But such a fall looks less probable as the indicators on the chart are positive . The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 100-day moving average. This is a bullish signal. Immediate resistance is at ₹619 . The possibilityof the stock breaking above this hurdle is high. Such a break can will see the current uptrend extending to ₹625 and ₹635 levels in the coming days. The region between ₹635 and ₹640 is a crucial resistance. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹640 will confirm that the downtrend that has been in place since January has reversed. As such, the price action around the ₹635-₹640 resistance region will need a close watch to get a cue on the direction of the next move."

SBI plummeted 7 per cent last week breaking below the key support levels of ₹275 and ₹270. The stock made an intra-week low of ₹253.6 and recovered some of the loss before closing the week at ₹270. Near-term resistances are at ₹275 and ₹278. As long as the stock trades below ₹278, the outlook will remain negative and a fall to ₹256 is possible. A bounce from ₹256 can take the stock higher to ₹270 levels again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹256 and ₹278 is possible. But if SBI breaks below ₹256 decisively, it will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹245 or ₹243 in the coming weeks. Traders can go short if SBI reverses lower from the ₹275-278 resistance region. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹291 for the target of ₹245. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹270 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹260. The outlook for the stock will turn positive only on a strong rise past ₹278. In such a scenario, a relief rally to ₹287 and ₹290 is possible.










 ITC (₹303.7) 
ITC managed to stay afloat amid a strong sell-off in the broader markets last week. The stock made a smart recovery after falling about 3 per cent intra-week and closed just 1 per cent lower for the week. This reflects the inherent strength in the stock. It will come under pressure only if it declines below ₹295. The next targets are ₹290 and ₹285. But as long as ITC sustains above ₹295, the broader uptrend will remain intact. Immediate resistances are at ₹307 and ₹309. A strong break above ₹309 will take ITC higher to ₹317 or ₹321 over the short term. Further break above ₹321 will then target ₹327 — the next crucial resistance level. As being reiterated over the last few weeks, a decisive break above ₹327 will boost the momentum and trigger a fresh rally to ₹360 over the medium term. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Traders with a medium-term perspective can make use of dips to go long at ₹298 and ₹293. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹270 for the target of ₹355.










Infosys (₹706.3)
Infosys tumbled 4 per cent last week. The sharp fall over the past week has taken the stock decisively below the 21-day moving average support that has been limiting the downside over the last five months. It also indicates early signs of the uptrend, that has been in place since September 2017, getting reversed. The region between ₹718 and ₹720 is a key resistance, which has to be breached to ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take Infosys higher to ₹740 and ₹750 levels again. But as long as the stock remains below ₹721, there is a strong likelihood of it breaking below the crucial support level of ₹690 in the coming days. Such a break will confirm the trend reversal and drag Infosys to ₹660. Further break below ₹660 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹630 and ₹625. Short-term traders with high-risk appetite can go short on a bounce to ₹710 and ₹717. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹732 for the target of ₹670.

The outlook will turn positive only if RIL manages to breach ₹1,253. This will see the stock revisiting ₹1,300 and ₹1,320 levels. But as long as the stock trades below ₹1,253, a fall to ₹1,175 or ₹1,170 cannot be ruled out in the short term. A bounce from the ₹1,175-1,170 support zone can trigger a relief rally to ₹1,200 and ₹1,220. But a break below ₹1,170 will increase the likelihood of the stock falling to ₹1,100. Traders with a medium-term perspective can wait for a bounce and go short at ₹1,225 and ₹1,245. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,265 for the target of ₹1,120. Revise the stop-loss to ₹1,205 when the stock moves down to ₹1,190.










 Tata Steel (₹615.3) 
Tata Steel seems to have remained insulated from the broader market sell-off. Though the stock tumbled about 6 per cent intraday on Friday, it managed to recover all the loss and close the week 1.5 per cent higher. Key resistance is at ₹640. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹680 and ₹700 thereafter. But if the sell-off in the broader market intensifies, the upside in this stock could be capped at ₹640. In such a scenario, Tata Steel can remain range-bound between ₹575 and ₹640 for some time. The outlook will turn negative only if Tata Steel declines below ₹575 — the 21-week moving average. Such a break can drag it to ₹550. But the price action on the chart indicates that the stock is likely to sustain above ₹575. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹560. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹620 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹635. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹635 as soon as Tata Steel moves up to ₹655."

SBI (₹265)
SBI was range-bound between ₹261 and ₹274 and closed 1.8 per cent lower for the week. The bias remains negative and any intermediate bounce in the coming days could be short-lived. A strong break below ₹261 — the 200-week moving average — can take the stock lower to ₹255. If SBI manages to bounce from ₹255, a relief rally to ₹270 is possible. But a strong break below ₹255 will increase the downside pressure. Such a break will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling to ₹245 thereafter. On the other hand, if SBI sustains above ₹261, a bounce to ₹275 is possible. The region between ₹275 and ₹277 is a key resistance zone. A strong break above ₹277 is needed to ease the downside pressure. This break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹285 over the short term. Traders with a high-risk appetite can go short on rallies at ₹273 and ₹276. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹291 for a target of ₹245. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹267 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹259.










ITC (₹296.7)
ITC shares fell 2.3 per cent and were down for the fourth consecutive week. Clusters of moving average and trendline supports are poised in the ₹290-₹280 region, which is holding well for now. ITC made a low of ₹289.5 last week and bounced from there. If the stock sustains above ₹290, an up-move to ₹305 and ₹307 is possible. A strong break above ₹307 will take the stock up to ₹317 or even ₹321 over the short term. It will confirm the end of the corrective fall that has been in place since early September. But if ITC reverses lower from the ₹305-307 resistance region, it can fall back to ₹295 and ₹290 levels again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹290 and ₹307 is possible for some time. A break below ₹290 can take ITC lower to ₹285 and ₹280. Investors can hold their long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Medium-term traders who took long positions last week on dips at ₹298 and ₹293 can hold them. Retain the stop-loss at ₹270 for a target of ₹355.










Infosys (₹727.8)
Infosys surged 3 per cent last week, recovering most of the loss made in the week earlier. The sharp bounce in the past week has triggered the stop-loss on the short positions recommended last week. The price action over the past two weeks leaves the immediate outlook unclear for the stock. Key support is at ₹690 and resistance is in between ₹740 and ₹750. Infosys can remain in a broad sideways range between ₹690 and ₹750. A breakout on either side of ₹690 or ₹750 will then decide the next move. A strong break above ₹750 can take the stock higher to ₹757 initially. A break above ₹757 will then take the stock fhigher to ₹770 thereafter. On the other hand, if the Infosys stock breaks below ₹690, it can come under selling pressure. This break will drag the stock lower to ₹660 on the back of profit-booking. It will also confirm that the uptrend since August 2017 has reversed. Further break below ₹660 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹630 and ₹625










RIL (₹1,258.2)
Contrary to expectations, RIL surged over 3 per cent last week. The short positions recommended last week have been stopped out on the strong bounce-back move witnessed last week. The head and shoulder reversal pattern mentioned last week has got negated. A key support is at ₹1,242. As long as the stock remains above this support, an up-move to ₹1,280 is possible. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,280 will boost the momentum. Such a break will then pave way for a fresh rally to ₹1,350 or even higher levels. The bullish outlook will get negated if RIL declines below ₹1,242 decisively. Such a break can drag the stock lower to ₹1,200 or ₹1,195 in the near term. Further break below ₹1,195 will then increase the likelihood of the downmove extending to ₹1,185 or ₹1,180. The level of ₹1,180 is a crucial long-term trend-line support for the stock. The uptrend that has been in place since the beginning of this year will come under threat if RIL declines below ₹1,180.










Tata Steel (₹580.35)
Tata Steel tumbled over 7 per cent last week. The stock is poised above a crucial support level of ₹575. Whether Tata Steel bounces from this support or not will determine the next move. A bounce from ₹575 will ease the downside pressure. In such a scenario, an up-move to ₹605 or ₹615 can be seen in the near term. An inability to breach ₹615 levels can drag the stock to ₹590. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹575 and ₹615 can be seen. But if Tata Steel manages to breach ₹615, it can extend its rally to ₹637 and ₹640 thereafter. On the other hand, if Tata Steel breaks below ₹575, it can fall to ₹559. Further break below ₹559 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹540 or ₹535 thereafter. Medium-term traders can retain their long positions. Keep the stop-loss at ₹560. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹605 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹613. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹615 as soon as Tata Steel goes up to ₹630."

Shares of India's biggest steel maker, Tata Steel Ltd, rose as much as 3.6 per cent to Rs 610.60, highest since September 28. The company’s Q2 net profit grew more than three-fold to Rs 3,116 crore ($428.8 million), beating market estimates, buoyed by strong domestic growth.
Indian operations continued to shine in Q2, more than offsetting disappointing European performance, says HSBC. It has kept “buy” rating with a price target of Rs 890.
Morgan Stanley says net debt remains stable sequentially; key positive surprise was better-than-expected realisation in domestic business, while costs were in line.
Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained “add” and raised the price target to Rs 670 from Rs 660. About 12.5 million shares changed hands, compared with the 30-day moving average vol of about 6.5 millioin. Tata Steel stock was down about 10.9 per cent this year as of last close."

SBI (₹289.1)
SBI opened the week on a negative note with a wide gap-down of ₹14 at ₹261.1. The stop-loss on the long positions recommended was hit. However, the stock managed to claw-back from the low of ₹261.1, recovering all the loss and closed on a positive note. The stock was up 5 per cent for the week. A crucial near-term resistance is at ₹294. Whether SBI breaks above this hurdle or not will determine the direction of the next move. Inability to breach ₹294 can pull the stock lower to ₹278 or ₹274 in the near term. A further break below ₹274 will then target ₹269. On the other hand, if SBI breaks above ₹294 decisively, it can gain strength. Such a break can take the stock initially higher to ₹310 and ₹312. A strong break above ₹312 will then pave way for the next target of ₹322 thereafter. Short-term traders can go long on a break above ₹294. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹282 for the target of ₹318. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹307.










ITC (₹275.6)
ITC broke below the key support level of ₹271 in the initial part of the week. However, negative sentiment was short-lived as ITC reversed sharply higher, recovering all the loss from the low of ₹268.2. Though the daily candles on the chart give mixed signals, the weekly candles are relatively positive. Support is in the ₹272-271 region. As long as the stock remains above this support zone, there is a strong likelihood of it breaking above the near-term resistance level of ₹279. Such a break can take ITC initially higher to ₹285 or ₹287. A further break above ₹287 will increase the possibility of the stock extending its up-move towards the 21-week moving average resistance level of ₹293. The bullish outlook will get negated if ITC breaks and closes decisively below ₹271. The stock can, thus, fall initially to ₹267. A bounce from ₹267 can take the stock higher to ₹271 and ₹272 again. But a strong break below ₹267 will increase the downside pressure. This will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹262 thereafter.










Infosys (₹705.6)
Infosys is retaining its strength. The stock was up for the third consecutive week. It surged 3.6 per cent, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹687 and closed on a strong note. The outlook is bullish. Immediate support is at ₹698 and the next key support is at ₹688. Also, there is an inverted head and shoulder pattern visible on the daily chart. This is a bullish reversal pattern. The neckline support of this pattern is at ₹684. Intermediate dips in the near term are likely to find fresh buyers coming into the market. An up-move to ₹721 is likely in the near term. Inability to breach ₹721 can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹700. But an eventual break above ₹721 will boost the momentum. This will increase the likelihood of the stock revisiting ₹740 and ₹750 levels. Traders can go long at current levels and also accumulate on dips at the levels of ₹701 and ₹693. Keep the stop-loss at ₹675 for the target of ₹760. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹715 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹730.










RIL (₹1,111.7)
RIL fell for the second consecutive week. The stock was down about 2 per cent last week. However, the sharp bounce from the week’s low of ₹1,055 gives a breather for the stock. The 200-day as well as a trend-line, both poised around ₹1,055, has provided strong support for RIL. The near-term outlook is mixed. Resistance is at ₹1,128. If RIL manages to sustain above ₹1,100 and decisively break above ₹1,128, the near-term outlook will turn positive. An up-move to ₹1,160 is possible. A further break above ₹1,160 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹1,185. On the other hand, if RIL declines below ₹1,100, it can fall to ₹1,055 again. A further break below ₹1,055 will increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹1,030 or even ₹1,010 thereafter. Broadly, RIL has been range-bound between ₹1,050 and ₹1,200 since October. A decisive breakout on either side of ₹1,050 or ₹1,200 will determine the direction of the next move. Traders can stay out of this stock until a clear trend emerges.










Tata Steel (₹513.4)
Tata Steel snapped its three-week fall. The stock reversed higher from the low of ₹486.9, recovering all the loss and closed 1.1 per cent higher for the week. Though the stock has bounced back, the price action seems to be lacking strength. This leaves the bias negative and keeps the broader downtrend intact. Cluster of resistance is poised in the ₹530-540 region, which can cap the upside in the near term. If Tata Steel manages to breach ₹540, an upmove to ₹565 and ₹570 is possible. But while below ₹540, a fall again to ₹485 and ₹480 cannot be ruled out. A bounce from around ₹480 again can keep the stock range-bound between ₹480 and ₹540. But a strong break below ₹480 can drag Tata Steel lower to ₹460. The level of ₹460 is a crucial long-term trend support, which may have the potential to halt the downtrend that has been in place since the beginning of this year. As such, the price action around ₹460 will need a close watch to get a cue on the next move."

SBI (₹294.4) 
SBI is managing to sustain higher. The stock dipped to an intraweek low of ₹287.2, but reversed immediately higher from there. The resistance at ₹301 is likely to be tested in the near term. Inability to breach ₹301 can pull SBI lower to ₹290 and ₹287 again. But the price action on the chart leaves the bias bullish for the stock to break above ₹301 and rally towards ₹310 and ₹312. A further break above ₹312 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹320 and ₹322. The region around ₹322 is a crucial long-term resistance. The price action around this hurdle will need a close watch to get a cue on the next direction of move. Supports are at ₹287 and ₹284.5. The near-term view will turn negative only if SBI declines below ₹284.5. The next target is ₹280. But such a fall looks less probable at the moment. Traders who have taken long positions above ₹294 can hold with a stop-loss at ₹282. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock goes up to ₹307. Book profits at ₹318. 










ITC (₹281.9) 
ITC inched higher for the third consecutive week. The stock was up 2 per cent last week. Immediate resistance is at ₹284 and support at ₹278. The stock is likely to breach ₹284 and test ₹287 in the near term. A break above ₹287 can then target ₹290. The levels of ₹287 and ₹290 are key resistances, and whether ITC breaches these hurdles or not will decide the direction of the next move. A decisive break above ₹290 will boost the momentum and take ITC higher to ₹296 and ₹300 thereafter. Such an up-move will also confirm the end of the downtrend that has been in place since September. On the other hand, if ITC reverses lower from ₹287 or ₹290, it can fall to ₹280 and ₹275 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹275 and ₹290.










Infosys (₹657.6) 
Infosys fell in the initial part of the week but managed to claw-back from the low of ₹637.7 and closed 2 per cent higher. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 200-day moving average support at ₹649 is holding well . Key resistances are at ₹663, ₹666 and ₹671. As long as Infosys trades above ₹649, a test of the above-mentioned hurdles is possible in the near term. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹671 will turn the outlook to positive and take the stock higher to ₹682 and ₹686. A further break above ₹686 will then pave way for the next short-term targets of ₹700 and ₹710. The stock will come under pressure if it breaks decisively below the 200-day moving average. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹630. A break below ₹630 can then drag it to ₹600 and ₹590. Traders who took short positions last week at ₹660 should remain cautious. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹675. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹655 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹645. Book profits at ₹630. 










RIL (₹1,125.8) 
RIL reversed sharply higher last week after making a low of ₹1,066.5 and closed 2 per cent higher. The upward reversal has happened from the 200-day moving average, which has been providing strong support for the stock since October. The near-term view is positive and RIL can move up to ₹1,180 and ₹1,185. The stock has been range-bound between ₹1,050 and ₹1,185 for more than three months now. Its ability to bounce higher every time it dips to the 200-day moving average keeps the bias positive . The possibility is also high of the stock breaking above ₹1,185. Such a break will take RIL initially higher to ₹1,205 or ₹1,210. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,210 will then boost the momentum and pave way for the next target of ₹1,275. Medium-term investors can go long at current levels and accumulate on dips at ₹1,095 and ₹1,070. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,025. The outlook will turn negative only if RIL closes decisively below the 200-day moving average support. In such a scenario, the stock can fall to ₹1,000 and ₹990.










Tata Steel (₹513.7) 
After inching higher for two weeks, Tata Steel reversed last week. Trading in the stock was subdued. It was stuck in a narrow range between ₹505 and ₹521 last week. The 21-day moving average at ₹519 is restricting the upside. A strong break and a decisive close above this hurdle is needed to ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹533 or even ₹539 over the short term. Inability to breach ₹533 or ₹539 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹520 and ₹518. But a strong break above ₹539 will boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹546 and ₹550. On the other hand, if Tata Steel remains below the 21-day moving average resistance, a fall to ₹505 or ₹500 is possible in the near term. A break below ₹500 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹480. A bounce from ₹480 can keep the stock range-bound between ₹480 and ₹530 for some time. But a decisive break below ₹480 can then drag Tata Steel lower to the crucial support level of ₹460."
58,2018-12-30,Tata Steel,"Future Perfect: Go long on Tata Steel
The short-term outlook remains neutral for Tata Steel (₹513.7). While only a close above ₹538 will change the outlook to positive, a conclusive close below ₹498 will reconfirm the bearish trend. A close above ₹538 has the potential to lift the stock to ₹592 and a close above ₹637 will make it bullish.
F&O pointer: The Tata Steel January futures has been adding open interest consistently over the last few days. The January futures have been trading with a healthy premium of over ₹3, signalling long positions. Option trading indicates a range of ₹500-540. Strikes of ₹580-calls and ₹620-puts too turned active, signalling resistance at these levels.
Strategy: This strategy is for those who can withstand wild swings. We advice traders to consider going long on Tata Steel futures, with a strict stop-loss at ₹498. If the stock opens on a positive note on Monday and moves past ₹516, the stop-loss can be shifted to ₹508. While the initial target is ₹538, traders with a high-risk appetite and deep pockets to withstand wild swings can aim for ₹592, which may not happen in this series. So this strategy is for traders who can prepare to rollover. Stop-loss can be adjusted suitably above ₹520 level, according to one’s individual risk profile.
Follow-up: As predicted, Sun TV hit the support level. But the stock hit the low within two days and bounced back strongly. Those who failed to book profits can still consider holding the position and exiting if the underlying stock hits ₹590."

SBI (297.5) 
SBI has been struggling over the last few weeks for strong follow-through buyers to take it decisively above ₹300. But, at the same time, the stock is also not attracting fresh sellers to drag it sharply lower. This leaves the bias bullish. The 21-day moving average at ₹289 is a key near-term support. As long as SBI trades above this support, the possibility of the stock breaching the ₹300-₹302 support zone is high. Such a break will take the stock higher initially to ₹310 and ₹312. A further break above ₹312 can then target ₹320 and ₹322. As mentioned last week, a crucial long-term resistance is poised around ₹322. As such, the price action around it will need a close watch to get a cue on the direction of the next move. The near-term view will turn negative if SBI declines decisively below ₹289. In such a scenario, a fall to ₹282 or ₹280 is possible. Traders who have taken long positions above ₹294 can hold it with a stop-loss at ₹282. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹307. Book profits at ₹318.










ITC (₹280.7) 
ITC was stuck in a sideways range between ₹277 and ₹284 last week. The resistance at ₹284 is continuing to cap the upside for the third consecutive week. A strong break above this hurdle is needed to ease the downside pressure for the stock. Such a break can take ITC higher initially to ₹287 and ₹290 — the next key resistance levels. If ITC manages to breach ₹290 decisively, the stock can gain momentum and target ₹296 and ₹300. But a pull-back from ₹290 can drag the stock lower to ₹285 and ₹280 again. On the other hand, if ITC continues to trade below ₹284 in the coming days and declines below ₹277, it can test ₹275 and ₹274. The outlook will turn completely negative if the stock breaks decisively below ₹274. In such a scenario, there is a strong likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹270 and ₹268. But the price action on the chart makes the bias bullish for ITC to break above ₹284. Medium-term investors who have taken long positions at ₹282 and ₹278 can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹262.










Infosys (₹660.7) 
Infosys seems to be lacking strength. The stock inched up in the initial part of the week but failed to sustain higher. Infosys made an intraweek high of ₹677 and came-off sharply giving up almost all the gains made during the week. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 200-day moving average at ₹650 is a crucial support to watch out for. If Infosys manages to sustain above this support, a bounce to ₹675 and ₹680 is possible in the near term. A strong break above ₹680 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹700 and ₹710 levels thereafter. The region around ₹710 is a significant resistance. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹710 is needed to turn the outlook completely to positive. Such a break will then pave way for the next targets of ₹750 and ₹760. On the other hand, if Infosys declines decisively below the 200-day moving average, it can come under renewed pressure. In such a scenario, a fall initially to ₹630 can be seen. A further break below ₹630 can then drag the stock lower to ₹600 and ₹590. 










RIL (₹1,099)
RIL has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹1,050 and ₹1,150 over the last one month. Within this range, the stock fell 2 per cent in the past week. A breakout on either side of ₹1,050 or ₹1,150 will determine the direction of the next move. The 200-day moving average support is at ₹1,069. A decisive close below this support will increase the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,050. A break below ₹1,050 will take RIL initially lower to ₹1,020. A further break below ₹1,020 will then increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹900 or even ₹980 thereafter. On the other hand, if RIL sustains above the 200-day moving average support, the bias will remain positive. A strong break above ₹1,150 will ease the downside pressure. The next targets are ₹1,190 and ₹1,200. A strong break above ₹1,200 will turn the outlook to positive and will pave way for a revisit of ₹1,250 and ₹1,300. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions taken at ₹1,125 and ₹1,095. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,025. 










Tata Steel (₹487.7) 
Tata Steel tumbled 5 per cent last week. The sharp fall last week indicates that the long-term downtrend in the stock is intact. Though there is a support near current levels at ₹480, Tata Steel looks vulnerable to break below it. A break below ₹480 can take the stock lower to ₹460. A further break below ₹460 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹430. Cluster of significant supports are poised in the broad ₹460-₹430 region. There is a strong likelihood of the current downtrend halting in this support zone. A strong upward reversal from this ₹460-₹430 support zone could be a good buying opportunity for investors with a long-term perspective. As such, the price action around the ₹460-₹430 support zone will need a close watch to get a cue on the next trend. On the other hand, if Tata Steel sustains above ₹480, a bounce to ₹500 or ₹510 can be seen. But the upside is likely to be capped as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels."

The stocks of Tata Steel on Wednesday hit a 52-week low at 477.30 ahead of the Q3 earnings. At about 12.50 pm, the scrips were trading lower by 2.43 per cent at Rs 479.40.
Tata Steel Ltd, one of the flagship companies of the salt-to-software behemoth, said on Tuesday lower production in Europe will impact its financial results, ahead of a planned merger with Germany's Thyssenkrupp .
Production from its European plants fell 12.7 per cent to 2.33 million tonnes for the third quarter ended Dec. 31, the company said in a press release.
Shutdowns and operational issues at IJmuiden plant in the Netherlands and Port Talbot in Wales hurt the company's performance in the quarter, Tata Steel said. The company is currently awaiting approval from the European Commission (EC) to combine its steel unit in Europe with Thyssenkrupp, a deal that was announced last year.
Thyssenkrupp on Tuesday said it had submitted documents that the EC requested in December to resume its in-depth investigation of the transaction, which would create Europe's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal."

Centrum Broking 
Tata Steel (Buy)
CMP: ₹480.4
Target: ₹660
Key takeaways: 
 Tata Steel indicated that spreads could be lower Q4 onwards, led by lower steel prices (average q-o-q fall of about ₹3,000/tonne expected) partly mitigated by lower costs. Deleveraging efforts have been stepped up with the announcement of the divestiture of SEA operations, resulting in net debt reduction of $500 million. Management reiterated its guidance of reducing net debt by $1 billion over the next one year, saying this could be achieved even earlier. We adjust our costs and steel pricing estimates and reduce consolidated EBITDA estimate by 5 per cent/8 per cent for FY19E/20E, respectively.
 Valuation and risks: We are upbeat on Tata Steel’s prospects. Our comfort is derived from its healthy balance sheet as it shifts European operations to a joint venture in FY20E. In addition, Tata Steel generates strong cash flows from residual businesses led by low-cost domestic operations, to be further strengthened in the next few years as synergies and scale benefits are realised at BSL, KPO and UML. 
We value Tata Steel using SOTP and arrive at a fair value of ₹660. Maintain Buy. 
Risks: Downside risks to our call are a sharp fall in steel prices/spreads and more asset acquisitions."

SBI (272.9) 
SBI began the week on a weak note and fell about 2 per cent initially. However, the stock managed to reverse sharply higher from the low of ₹266.3, recovering all the loss. The price action on the charts over the last couple of weeks leaves the near-term outlook positive. A key support is at ₹267, which is likely to limit the downside. An upmove to ₹280 and ₹285 is likely in the near term. A cluster of resistances is poised in the ₹280-285 zone. Inability to breach this resistance region can drag SBI to ₹270 again. But a strong break above ₹285 will boost the momentum and increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹295 and ₹300 in the coming weeks. Short-term traders with a high-risk appetite can go long at current levels and accumulate at ₹269. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹265 for the target of ₹285. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹276 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹279. The 200-week moving average at ₹260 is a crucial support. The outlook will turn negative only if SBI declines below this support.










ITC (₹277.8) 
ITC has been stuck in the ₹273-284 sideways range for more than a month now. Within this range, the near-term outlook is bullish. ITC has risen and closed above the 21-day moving average at ₹276.5, which will now act as a good support. As long as the stock trades above this support, an upmove to ₹284 is possible in the near term. A pull-back from ₹284 levels will keep the sideways range intact and take the stock lower to ₹277-275 again. But a decisive close above ₹284 will mark the end of the sideways consolidation. It will then take the stock initially to ₹289. A further break above ₹289 will then trigger a fresh rally, targeting ₹301. The bullish outlook will get negated only if ITC breaks below 273. The next target is ₹265. But the price action on the chart keeps the bias positive and leaves the possibility high of the stock breaching ₹284 in the coming days. As such, investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at ₹282, ₹278 and ₹272. Retain the stop-loss at ₹262.










Infosys (₹741.1) 
Infosys surged to a high of ₹757.8, but later gave back most of the gains. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 21-day moving average resistance is at ₹747. A decisive close above it is needed to turn the outlook to positive. Such a break can take Infosys higher to ₹790 and ₹800. But as long as the stock trades below ₹747, a dip to ₹725 cannot be ruled out in the near term. A break below ₹725 will then take the stock lower to ₹710 or even ₹700 thereafter. However, a further fall below ₹700 looks unlikely. A cluster of supports poised between ₹710 and ₹700 is likely to limit the downside. An upward reversal from the ₹710-700 support zone will trigger a fresh rally to ₹745 and ₹750. A further break above ₹750 will then give rise to targets of ₹770 and ₹790. Medium-term traders can make use of dips to go long at ₹725. Accumulate longs at ₹720 and ₹715. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹680 for a target of ₹790. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹735 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹755. 










RIL (₹1,226.7) 
RIL inched lower for the third consecutive week. The 21-day moving average resistance at ₹1,248 continued to cap the upside in the stock for the second consecutive week. RIL can remain range-bound between ₹1,200 and ₹1,250 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹1,200 or ₹1,250 will decide the direction of the next move. A strong break above ₹1,250 can take the stock initially to ₹1,260. A further decisive break above ₹1,260 will boost the momentum and increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹1,300 and ₹1,320 in the short term. On the other hand, if RIL declines decisively below ₹1,200, the stock will come under renewed pressure. In such a scenario, RIL can fall initially to ₹1,175. A further break below ₹1,175 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹1,145. It will also confirm the head and shoulder reversal pattern on the daily chart. This is a bearish pattern, which may keep the stock under pressure. Investors can hold the long positions taken at ₹1,260, ₹1,245 and ₹1,225. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,180 for the target of ₹1,420.










Tata Steel (₹507.1) 
Tata Steel has been moving higher as expected, but at a slow pace. The stock was up 1 per cent last week. The short-term outlook continues to remain positive. A near-term resistance is at ₹517 — the 100-day moving average. A pull-back from this resistance can trigger a fall to ₹495 and ₹490. A further fall below ₹490 looks unlikely at the moment. An upward reversal from the ₹495-490 support zone will take the stock higher to ₹515 levels again. An eventual break above the 100-day moving average resistance will then increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹545 and ₹550 thereafter. The upmove from the January low of ₹442 is significant as it happened from the 200-week moving average support. Whether the current move is a trend reversal or just a corrective rally will become clear in the coming weeks. Short-term traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹502. Retain the stop-loss at ₹480 for the target of ₹545. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹510 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹517."

SBI (320.8)
The uptrend in SBI is gaining momentum. The stock surged 7.6 per cent last week, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹305. Resistance is near current levels at around ₹321. A pull-back from that can trigger a corrective fall to ₹315. A break below ₹315 can drag the stock lower to ₹305. However, the bias continues to remain positive. So, a further fall below ₹305 looks less probable. A bounce from ₹305 will have the potential to take the stock above ₹321. In such a scenario, a rally to ₹350 is likely. The indicators on the charts are positive. The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 55-, 100- and 200-day moving averages. This is a strong bullish sign, indicating that the downside could be limited and the uptrend is likely to remain in place. Short-term traders can wait for dips and go long at ₹315 and accumulate at ₹308. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹295 for the target of ₹350. Revise the stop-loss to ₹325 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹335.










ITC (296.7)
ITC was volatile last week. The stock fell initially to a low of ₹291.2 and bounced back to make a high of ₹302.95. However, it fell in the final trading session of the week, giving back all the gains and closed on a flat note. The resistance at ₹302 is holding well. ITC has to make a decisive close above this hurdle to regain strength and move higher. The next target is ₹309. The level of ₹309 is a key long-term trend resistance. Inability to rise past this level can trigger a corrective fall to ₹302 or ₹300. But a strong break above ₹309 will increase the likelihood of the rally extending to ₹320 and ₹322 over the medium term. On the other hand, if ITC continues to trade below ₹302, a dip to ₹293 or ₹290 is possible. Investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at ₹282, ₹278 and ₹272 with a revised stop-loss at ₹289. Move the stop-loss further higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹305. Book profits at ₹310.










Infosys (₹742.3)
Infosys tumbled 3 per cent intraweek and made a low of ₹719.6. However, the stock reversed sharply higher recovering all the loss. The bias remains positive on the chart. The 21-day moving average at ₹726 is a key support. The quick bounce from ₹719 indicates that the stock is getting fresh buyers below ₹726. So as long as the stock trades above the 21-day moving average support, there is a strong likelihood of it moving higher to ₹750-₹755. A further break above ₹755 will then increase the likelihood of the uptrend extending to ₹780. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if Infosys makes a decisive close below the 21-day moving average. A fall to ₹705 or ₹700 is possible. A further fall below ₹700 looks less probable at the moment. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹725, ₹720 and ₹715. Retain the stop-loss at ₹680 for the target of ₹790. Revise the stop-loss to ₹735 as the stock moves up to ₹755.










RIL (₹1,363)
RIL opened the week with a gap-down and fell to a low of ₹1,317.15. However, the negative sentiment was short-lived and RIL clawed back, recovering all the loss and closed 1.5 per cent higher for the week. The support at ₹1,316 mentioned last week has held very well. This leaves the bullish outlook intact. A near-term resistance is at ₹1,385, which is likely to be tested in the coming days. Inability to breach this hurdle can drag the stock lower to ₹1,350 initially. A further break below ₹1,350 will then increase the likelihood of the downmove extending to ₹1,315 or ₹1,310. But, if RIL manages to break above ₹1,385, it can gain fresh strength. In such a scenario, RIL can surge to ₹1,400. A strong break above ₹1,400 will be very bullish from a long-term perspective. This will pave way for ₹1,450 and ₹1,500 over the long term. The outlook for the stock will turn negative only if RIL declines below ₹1,300. Such a break can trigger a corrective fall to ₹1,260 and ₹1,250.










Tata Steel (₹520.8)
Tata Steel continued to consolidate for the fourth consecutive week. The stock has been stuck between ₹505 and ₹532. A breakout on either side of ₹505 or ₹532 will decide the next move. If Tata Steel breaks the range below ₹505, it can fall to ₹495 or ₹490. But such a fall looks less likely as the price action on the chart leaves the possibility high of the stock breaking above ₹532. The stock is well above the 21-week moving average level of ₹507. As long as it trades above this support, the bias will remain positive. A strong break above ₹532 will take Tata Steel to ₹540. A further break above ₹540 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹560 over the medium term. Traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹518 and ₹512. Retain the stop-loss at ₹487 for the target of ₹555. Revise the stop-loss to ₹515 on a rally to ₹525.

The stock price of Tata Steel surged 7.19 per cent on Friday due to healthy earnings in the quarter ended March 2019. The consolidated steel production and deliveries grew above estimates by 27 per cent and 29 per cent year-on-year respectively.
The consolidated operating profit increased 33 per cent to ₹7,814 crore, on the back of higher sales and good realisations.
It is to be noted that the earnings of the company’s South-East Asian operations were not consolidated in the profit and loss account but shown as a discontinued operations as it recently entered into an agreement to pare off those low-profitable operations.
Indian operations contributed 63 per cent to the consolidated sales of 7.52 million tonnes (mt) in the quarter ending March 31, 2019. In the said quarter, Tata Steel India’s collective production and sales grew 48 per cent and 55 per cent to 4.48 mt and 4.72 mt respectively.
Production increased on account of acquisition of Bhushan Steel (Tata Steel BSL) and ramping-up of capacities at both Kalinganagar and Tata Steel BSL. Increase in sales was driven by higher demand from infrastructure sector. As a result of higher sales volume, revenues grew by 51 per cent y-o-y in the fourth quarter of FY19.
However, there was pressure on operating profits in the March quarter of 2019. Tata Steel India’s standalone EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) per tonne fell by about 8 per cent y-o-y to ₹13,619. Bhushan Steel, which was acquired by Tata Steel in May 2018, also felt the pinch, as EBITDA per tonne fell to ₹6,911 per tonne from its high of ₹11,000.
Weak operating profits could be attributed to marginally lower realisations and higher costs of coking coal. Also, because of the weaker domestic demand in the initial part of the quarter, the company increased its exposure to overseas market where realisations are weaker than in India. Further, high-margin automotive sales has declined 14 per cent from a year-ago period due to slack demand from the automotive industry.
While the sales volume in the European business grew by a marginal 0.7 per cent to 2.57 mt, the operating profit increased by 5.18 per cent to about ₹1,200 crore (excluding one-off gain) on the back of improved realisations and savings on maintenance costs.
With regards to Tata Steel Europe’s joint venture with thyssenkrupp AG, the European commission issued a statement of objection for which both the companies submitted a package of proposed remedies. The deal is expected to take quite some time before it sees the light of the day."
44,2019-04-28,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel-Tata Steel BSL: A favourable merger ratio
Following the successful resolution of insolvent Bhushan Steel, Tata Steel induced a portion of capital in the form of equity on taking over. Lenders, too, converted some of their debt to equity.
This led to significant dilution of public shareholding in the erstwhile Bhushan Steel (now, Tata Steel BSL). But if you still hold the shares of Tata Steel BSL, you have a reason to smile. To leverage on operational synergies and to simplify the group’s structure, Tata Steel and Tata Steel BSL have proposed to merge both the companies. The recommended merger ratio would be one share of Tata Steel for every 15 shares of Tata Steel BSL.
As per the closing stock prices on the lat trading day, 15 shares of Bhushan Steel is priced ₹519. Post-amalgamation, the total number of shares of Tata Steel will be increased by nearly two crore. Taking the current market valuation of Tata Steel, the share price of Tata Steel, post-amalgamation, would be ₹535.68. This means that a share of Tata Steel is issued at a discount of ₹16.68 or 3 per cent. Note that the merger is subject to shareholders and other regulatory approvals."

42,2019-05-06,Tata Steel,"How to take stock of a company’s inventory
Companies engaged in manufacturing and trading goods tend to have a chunk of inventory or stock on hand at any given point in time. Knowing the right value of inventory, as on a particular date, is important, as the accuracy of both the statement of profit and loss (SOPL) as well as the balance-sheet depends on this value.
Inventory refers to the goods held by the company and includes finished goods ready for sale, semi-finished goods (work-in-progress) and raw materials used in the production of finished goods.
The value of inventory is disclosed as part of current assets under the balance-sheet. To give an accurate picture, the inventory of a company should be valued at cost or NRV (net realisable value), whichever is lower.
Every company assesses and values its inventory at the end of each reporting period and makes necessary adjustments to comply with the principle of ‘lower of cost or NRV’.
Such adjustments impact the company’s profits in many cases. For example, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation’s (HPCL) net profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was down 87.2 per cent compared to the same period a year ago.
The sharp fall was largely attributed to an inventory loss raised by fall in crude oil prices that affects the realisable value.
The value of closing stock disclosed is prone to fraudulent calculations as it could alter the company’s profitability.
The assessment of the cost and realisable value of the stock is also at the discretion of the management.
Thus, confirming the veracity of the valuation of closing stock is important as it impacts the profit of not just the reported period alone, but also the following period — the closing inventory of one period will be an opening inventory of the following period.
The accurate value of inventory is also important to guage the cash flows, the working-capital situation as well as whether the company is holding too much inventory or too little, when compared to its peers. These metrics give us an idea of the company’s liquidity position.
In the SOPL, the difference between opening and closing inventory is shown as ‘changes in inventories’ under expenses. The value of ‘change in inventories’ varies based on the production, sales, closing stock available, cost of production and the net realisable value.
A positive value of ‘change in inventories’ means that the opening stock’s value is higher than the closing stock’s. This could arise due to higher sales or lower production or drop in realisable value of the stock.
On the other hand, if the ‘change in inventories’ is negative, it means that the closing stock’s value is higher than the opening stock’s — that could arise on account of drop in sales or higher production or increase in realisable value.
In case of, say, retail industry, ‘change in inventories’ depends mostly on sales and production of the product. But in case of industries such as real estate and commodities like oil, metals, agri products — whose sales realisations depend on the external factors — ‘change in inventories’ will also be impacted by market price movement.
For instance, Tata Steel’s ‘change in inventories’ value for FY18 and FY17 was a positive ₹545 crore and a negative ₹1,329 crore, respectively.
The sharp change in FY18 was largely due to higher growth in sales than in production that led to lower closing than opening stock.
Meanwhile, in the HPCL’s example, while the ‘change in inventories’ value for the third quarter in FY19 was a positive ₹5,034 crore, it was a negative ₹1,848 in the second quarter of the same year. Lower closing value (that led to positive ‘change in inventories’) in the third quarter was mainly due to inventory losses caused by low crude oil prices that reduced the NRV.
One can analyse the relationship between sales and inventory movement by using a metric — inventory turnover.
The ratio, which is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold by average inventory ((opening+closing)/2) will help in identifying the number of times the company has sold the inventory and replaced.
For example, if a company’s cost of goods sold was ₹10 lakh and the average inventory held by the company was ₹50,000 in a year, the inventory turnover is 20 times.
Further, if the number of days in a period is divided by the inventory turnover, it gives inventory days — the number of days the company took to sell its inventory.
Lower inventory days is generally considered to be good as it represents faster inventory replacement due to higher sales.
Inventory turnover or inventory days help in evaluating one company’s ability to sell its inventory compared to peer players in the same industry.
For example, average inventory days of a retail company, Hindustan Unilever and a steel major, Tata Steel was around 24 days and 72 days respectively."

Resistance may cap upside in SBI
SBI (₹308.05)










SBI tumbled over 5 per cent intra-week, breaking below the key support level of ₹302. However, it clawed back from the low of ₹292.2, recovering almost all the loss after the fourth-quarter results announcement on Friday. Though the weekly candle gives a mixed signal, the daily chart is relatively positive. A key support is at ₹302, which can limit the downside; resistance is at ₹313. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹321-322. A pull-back from ₹322 can trigger a corrective fall to ₹312. But a strong break above ₹322 will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹330-335. Given the weakness in the broader markets, such a strong rally looks less probable. So the upside is likely to be limited to ₹322 at the moment. On the other hand, if SBI fails to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹313, a fall to ₹302 or even ₹297 is possible. As such, the impact of Friday's results will be short-lived and the overall negative sentiment in the market could weigh on the stock. In that case, SBI can fall to ₹ 290 and ₹287.
Uptrend in ITC under threat
ITC (₹297.7)










ITC moved up in the initial part of the week but failed to sustain higher. The uptrend that has been in place since late February seems to be under threat. A key support is at ₹295 which is likely to be tested in the near term. The stock has to hold above this support in order to keep the sentiment positive. A break below ₹295 can drag the stock initially lower to ₹288-287. A further break below ₹287 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹280-278. Such a fall to ₹280-278 will be a good buying opportunity from a long-term perspective. Investors with a long-term perspective can take long positions at ₹285 and accumulate at ₹282 and ₹278. On the other hand, if ITC manages to sustain above ₹295 in the coming days, a bounce to ₹302 — the crucial 21-day moving average resistance — is possible. The stock has to surpass this hurdle to bring back the bullish momentum. Else, a pull-back to ₹295 is possible again. In that case, ITC can remain range-bound between ₹295 and ₹302 for some time.
Infosys can witness a fresh fall
Infosys (₹716.05)










Infosys has crucial supports in the ₹706-703 region, which can be tested in the near term. It’s ability to sustain above this support zone will decide its next move. A bounce from the ₹706-703 support region will ease the downside pressure. It will increase the possibility of the stock moving higher to ₹730-735 in the short term. It will also keep the broader ₹700-775 sideways range intact. Infosys has been trading in this range since mid-January. But if the stock breaks below ₹703 in the coming days, it will come under renewed pressure. Such a break will take the stock initially lower to ₹690-685. A further break below ₹685 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹670-665 on profit-booking. Indicators on the chart favour a decline below ₹703 and a fall to ₹670-665 in the coming weeks. However, the region between ₹670 and ₹665 is a crucial long-term support, which may halt the fall. A decisive bounce from the ₹670-665 support zone could be a good buying opportunity from a long-term perspective.
Outlook turns bearish for RIL
RIL (₹1,250.5)










Contrary to an expectation of a rise, RIL tumbled 11 per cent last week. Morgan Stanley, a global brokerage firm, downgrading the stock seems to have made investors book profits, triggering this sharp sell-off. The uptrend that has been in place since October 2018 has reversed, and the outlook has turned bearish. Though there is some support near the current levels, the broader picture is negative. So, any bounce from the current levels may be short-lived and could be restricted to ₹1,300-1,320. A further fall to ₹1,200-1,180 is possible in the coming days. The region around ₹1,180 is a strong long-term trend support which can halt the fall. A bounce from there will be bullish from a long-term perspective. Investors can start buying RIL at ₹1,200 and also accumulate at ₹1,285 and ₹1,295. However, the possibility of a prolonged sideways move between ₹1,180 and ₹1,300 cannot be ruled out after this fall. As such, the rally to fresh highs thereafter might take time. So, investors buying around ₹1,200 will need to be patient and hold the stock for a long period of time.
Down-move to extend in Tata Steel
Tata Steel (₹487.3)










Tata Steel tumbled 11 per cent last week. Reports that the company’s joint venture with German steel maker Thyssenkrupp may not go through was a major trigger for the sell-off in the stock last week. The resistance at ₹560 has held well. It also keeps intact the downtrend that has been in place since January 2018. A strong resistance is in the ₹505-510 region which can cap the upside. A rally beyond ₹510 looks unlikely now. Also, an intermediate bounce to this resistance zone is likely to find fresh sellers coming into the market. A fall to ₹455-450 or even ₹440 is likely in the coming days. A further break below ₹440 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹425 or even ₹400. Traders with a short-term perspective can make use of rallies to go short at ₹498 and ₹505. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹522 for the target of ₹455. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹490 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹475.

SBI (₹343.8)
SBI was stuck in a narrow range between ₹339 and ₹349 last week. The near-term outlook is mixed. SBI can trade sideways between the significant support at ₹335 and resistance at ₹350 for some time. Within this range, there is a strong likelihood of the stock falling to ₹335 — the lower end of the range in the early part of this week. A breakout on either side of ₹335 or ₹350 will decide the direction of the next move. A break below ₹335 can take SBI lower to ₹325 and ₹320. As being reiterated over the last couple of weeks, the region around ₹320 is a strong long-term resistance-turned-support, which can limit the downside. Fresh buyers are likely to emerge around this level. As such, a fall to ₹325-₹320 will be a good buying opportunity from a medium-term perspective. On the other hand, if SBI breaks above ₹350, it can move up to the next crucial resistance level of ₹362. SBI has to rise past ₹362 decisively to gain fresh bullish momentum. Targets above ₹362 are ₹390 and ₹400.










ITC (₹277.9)
 ITC has been managing to sustain above the crucial long-term support level of ₹275. However, the stock is not gaining strength for a strong rally. This indicates lack of fresh buying interest in the stock. ITC has to break above ₹282 to get a breather. Such a break can take it up towards ₹287 and ₹290. Only a strong rise past ₹290 will confirm the trend reversal, which will then pave way for the next targets of ₹300 and ₹310. But such a strong upmove looks unlikely at the moment. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average and is now on the verge of crossing below the 100-day moving average. This is a negative signal, indicating that the upside could be limited. It also keeps the possibilities open of the stock breaking below `275. As such, if ITC breaks below ₹275, the downside pressure will increase. In such a scenario, the current downtrend will remain intact and the stock can extend the fall to ₹265 and ₹260 thereafter. 










Infosys (₹740.4)
 Infosys moved up last week as expected, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹758.9 and reversed sharply lower, giving back almost all the gains. The resistance at ₹755 has held well. Key near-term supports are at ₹734 (21-week moving average) and ₹730 (21-day moving average), which are likely to limit the downside. A break and fall below ₹730 looks less probable now. As long as the stock trades above ₹730, the outlook will remain positive. An upward reversal from the ₹734-₹730 support zone can take the stock higher to ₹755 again. An eventual break above ₹755 will then take Infosys up to ₹770 and ₹775 — the upper end of the ₹695-₹775 sideways range. The stock has been stuck in this broad sideways range since mid-January this year. If it manages to rise past ₹775, it can gain fresh momentum and target ₹790 and ₹800. But a pull-back from ₹775 will keep the sideways range intact. In such a scenario, Infosys can fall-back initially to ₹760-₹750 and even lower thereafter. 










RIL (₹1,316.95)
RIL managed to sustain above ₹1,300 but is not gaining strength to move higher. The price action over the last few weeks increases the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,300. Inability to rise past ₹1,338 (55-day moving average) and a subsequent fall last week, strengthens the case for a fall below ₹1,300. RIL will come under renewed pressure on a break below ₹1,300 and can move lower to ₹1,280-1,275. This move could be sharp and swift. A further break below 1,275 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to 1,250 and even 1,220 over the medium term. On the other hand, if RIL manages to sustain above 1,300, a bounce to 1,338 is possible again. A break above 1,338 will then increase the possibility of the upmove extending to 1,350 and 1,360. The region between 1,360 and 1,365 is a crucial resistance. RIL has to rise past 1,365 to gain fresh momentum and target 1,400 and 1,430. But such a strong upmove looks unlikely at the moment. 










Tata Steel (₹501.4)
 Contrary to our expectation of a fall, Tata Steel surged last week. The stock was up 4 per cent. Support for the stock is in the ₹490-488 region. As long as the stock trades above this support zone, the near-term outlook will remain positive. A rise to ₹515-520 is likely. The region around 520 is a crucial long-term trend resistance. As such, Tata Steel has to rise past ₹520 decisively to turn the outlook bullish and also to signal a trend reversal. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹527-530. A further break above ₹530 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its upmove to ₹560 over the medium term. Inability to breach ₹520 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹500 and ₹490. A break below ₹490 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹460. In such a scenario, Tata Steel can trade in a sideways range between ₹460 and ₹520.

   -  PAUL NORONHA


The government should consider raising the maximum cap of import duty imposed on steel from 15 per cent to 40 per cent to protect the industry, which is reeling from slowing domestic demand and rising imports, said Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel, here on Friday.
Though raising the cap does not mean that India will immediately increase the import duty to 40 per cent, it could act as leverage that can be pulled in cases of unrealistic dumping, he added.
With the ongoing trade war between the two largest economies — China and the US — intensifying every other day, almost all the countries have protected their domestic companies by imposing trade barriers.
The contribution of the manufacturing sector to the GDP has been declining for several decades. Notwithstanding the challenges due to inefficient domestic cost structure and regulatory hurdles, the sector is plagued by increasing imports, said Rao.
Last year, about 10 million tonnes of steel were imported into the country, and almost 60 per cent of these came in duty-free from China, Japan and Korea. 
On the other hand, Indian companies pay 18 per cent GST, 30 per cent corporate tax a sizeable State government tax, he said.
While the logistics cost in India is 10 per cent higher compared to competing countries, the government reimburses only 2 per cent of the cost on exports under the duty drawback scheme, which are based on the customs duty levied on imports, rather than on the rate of State and municipal taxes, Rao added. The panel discussion was moderated by P Manoj, Deputy Editor, Business Line.
Sachchindanand Shukla, Chief Economist, Mahindra Group, said that the various sops given to the small and medium enterprises has forced many companies to remain small rather growing in size.
The industry should learn from China, as the cost of operations will come down automatically once the SMEs achieve scale, he added.
The government sops should focus on improving the production of value-added products, rather than encouraging companies to remain small and enjoy subsidies, he said.
Rather than making any big-bang changes, the Budget should focus on policy directions, and give time for the economy to heal from the series of disruptive economic reforms such as the GST, the IBC and implementation of RERA, said Shukla.
Udit Sheth, Vice-Chairman, Setco Automobile, said the ongoing global trade war is a great opportunity for India to push exports, but companies’ expertise to package their skill is “pathetic”.
The government in the Budget should reveal its policy to scrap old systems and encourage the industry to take advantage of the lower interest rate regime, he said.
The Budget should widen the tax net while lowering the rates, which will not only lower the burden on the industry but also help new entrepreneurs, said Sheth."

   -  Bloomberg


 India’s steelmakers, more accustomed to securing raw materials such as iron ore and coal, are keeping another key resource in their sights: water.
Two of India’s biggest steelmakers - JSW Steel and Tata Steel - and metal producer Vedanta have flagged risks due to water shortages in the past month as the world’s second-most populous country faces an unprecedented water crisis.
Competition for the resource is set to grow in India, where nearly a third of the country is water-stressed, increasing costs and risks for companies. A delayed monsoon, which accounts for 70 per cent of the nation’s annual rainfall, has exacerbated the situation this year.
The urgency surrounding water supply risks is not lost in our discussions with companies, but the talking is still happening behind closed doors, according to Damandeep Singh, director at CDP, which runs a global disclosure system for companies and others to report environmental risks. The problem is that when companies in India get water, they get it cheap. There’s no incentive to manage a resource when it is available so cheap.
Water is shaping up to be a serious economic risk in Asia’s third-largest economy. Desertification, land degradation and drought cost India about 2.54 per cent of gross domestic product in 2014-15, according to a study last year by Indias environment ministry. In a global survey of miners, just under half the respondents reported financial impact worth $11.8 billion over five years thanks to water-related problems such as droughts, increased water stress and flooding, according to a 2018 report from CDP.
Indias second-biggest steel mill JSW Steel has built a new water reservoir with 1.3 thousand million cubic feet storage capacity at its plant in the water-scarce southern state of Karnataka to ensure adequate supply for uninterrupted operations, the Sajjan Jindal-owned company said in its annual report on July 4.
Top producer Tata Steel is also investing in sewage treatment plants to process water for reuse and creating new rain water harvesting structures to improve the groundwater table. Water is used as a coolant in the steel making process and over 3 cubic meters of freshwater is required per ton of crude steel produced, it said in the annual report last month.
Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta performed a water risk assessment at 25 of its most significant business locations and found that its operations in Rajasthan, Punjab and Tamil Nadu had a greater risk of shortages than elsewhere because of competitive pressures for water usage in those regions, the Mumbai-based company said in its annual report last month.
About 600 million Indians are facing high-to-extreme water stress and the situation is set to worsen as water requirements rise, according to a 2018 report by NITI Aayog, the governments policy making body. Water demand is expected to be twice the available supply by 2030, implying severe water scarcity for hundreds of millions of people and an about 6 per cent loss in India’s gross domestic product, it said.
Greater demand for resources and extraction of mineral reserves in often water-scarce locations, where stable supply of water is no longer guaranteed, continues to jeopardize existing and future operations, according to CDP. Companies including miners have been taking water for granted for the longest period, CDP’s Singh said. They are still taking an ostrich-in-the-sand approach."

SBI (₹342.5)
SBI tumbled 3.8 per cent last week, breaking below the key support level of ₹350. The next support near ₹335 is holding well as of now. As long as SBI sustains above this support, a corrective rally to ₹350 is possible in the near term. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹350 are needed to ease the downside pressure and bring back the bullish sentiment. But a rally beyond ₹350 looks less probable now as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels. A pull-back from ₹350 can drag the stock lower to ₹335 again. An eventual break below the key base level of ₹335 will then increase the likelihood of the downtrend resuming and declining to ₹328. The level of ₹328 is a strong support where both the 21-week moving average as well as a trend-line support are poised. As such the current down-move can halt around ₹328 and a bounce to ₹335-340 is possible from there. But if SBI declines below ₹328, the down-move can extend to ₹320 in the ensuing weeks.










ITC (₹270.3)
ITC fell over a per cent in the initial part of the week, but managed to bounce thereafter. The stock made a low of ₹264.4 and reversed higher recovering all the loss. The 200-week moving average support is holding well as of now. However, a key resistance is at ₹273 (21-day moving average) which has to be breached to get a breather. A strong break above ₹273 can trigger a corrective rally to ₹278 and ₹282. The region between ₹282 and ₹285 is a strong resistance which is likely to cap the upside. A rise past ₹285 looks unlikely at the moment. On the other hand, if ITC fails to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹273 in the coming days, it can dip to test ₹263 again. A sideways consolidation between ₹263 and ₹273 is possible for some time. The bias will remain bearish. An eventual break below ₹263 can take the stock initially lower to ₹257. A further break below ₹257 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹245 – a strong long-term support.
 






Infosys (₹787.3)
Infosys rose last week to test ₹800 as expected, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹804.25 and oscillated between ₹782 and ₹805 all through the week. The near-term outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹780 and resistance at ₹800. The stock can trade sideways between ₹780 and ₹800 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹780 or ₹800 will then determine the direction of the next move. A break below ₹780 can trigger profit-booking and drag the stock lower to ₹765. A cluster of supports is poised in the band between ₹765 and ₹750. So the downside could be limited to ₹750 if the stock declines below ₹780. On the other hand, if Infosys manages to sustain above ₹780, the bias will remain positive. It will keep the possibility high of the stock breaking above ₹800. Such a break above ₹800 will give a fresh boost to the stock. It will also indicate the resumption of the uptrend and take the stock up to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks.










RIL (₹1,214.1)
RIL tumbled 2.8 per cent, breaking below the crucial support level of ₹1,250. The price action over the last month indicates that the stock has been lacking strong buyers to take it above ₹1,300. This coupled with the sharp fall below ₹1,250 gives an initial sign of the long-term uptrend getting reversed. A further fall below the psychological level of ₹1,200 will confirm the same. Such a fall will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹1,130-1,120 in the coming weeks. The move below ₹1,200 could be sharp and swift as it could trigger strong profit-booking. But, if RIL manages to sustain above ₹1,200, a bounce to ₹1,250 is possible. In such a scenario, a sideways move in the ₹1,200-1,250 band can be seen for some time. RIL has to rise past ₹1,250 decisively to ease the downside pressure. A rise to ₹1,300 is possible on a break above ₹1,250. But such a strong up-move looks unlikely at the moment as fresh sellers are likely to emerge around ₹1,250 levels and cap the upside. 










Tata Steel (₹445.2)
Tata Steel extended its fall and kept the downtrend intact. The stock was down 2.8 per cent last week. An immediate resistance is in the ₹448-450 region and the next significant one is at ₹470, which can cap the upside. A rise past ₹470 looks unlikely. Tata Steel is likely to tumble towards ₹400 in the coming weeks. The region around ₹400 is a key support. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement support is also poised around ₹400. As such, the current fall can halt at ₹400. A corrective rally to ₹450 is possible if Tata Steel manages to bounce from ₹400. But the upside of this corrective rally is likely to be capped at ₹450. But if the stock fails to bounce from ₹400 and falls further, the downside pressure will increase. The break below ₹400 will see the stock tumbling to ₹350 or lower over the medium term.

JRD Tata also firmly believed that the pursuit of excellence requires the best leadership
   -  Special Arrangement




JRD Tata also firmly believed that the pursuit of excellence requires the best leadership
   -  Special Arrangement


The pursuit of excellence drives positive and transformative change, because it sets our sights very high, well beyond what we are achieving today, and expands the boundaries of what is possible.
JRD Tata, whose birth anniversary we celebrate this month, lived and practised this principle. As Chairman of the Tata Group for over five decades, he pushed for excellence in all quarters. This enabled him to make remarkable contributions to Indian industry.
JRD’s philosophy of excellence is summed up in a letter that he wrote in 1965 to an educationist in Kolkata, where he laid out the guiding principles of his life.
One of these principles was - “That one must forever strive for excellence, or even perfection, in any task however small, and never be satisfied with the second best.”
How small could such a task be, where excellence must be sought at all times? Some stories from the early days of Air India, which JRD Tata had originally founded as Tata Air Lines, provide us a glimpse. He was then the Chairman of this magnificent enterprise, India’s first international airline.
Whenever he flew Air India, he would observe everything around him, and write back to the Management with his comments. Once, after traveling on an Air India flight to Europe, he wrote a memo to the General Manager of the airline:
“The tea served on board from Geneva, is, without exaggeration, indistinguishable in colour from coffee. I do not know if the black colour of the tea is due to the quality used, or due to excessive brewing. I suggest that the Station Manager at Geneva be asked to look into the matter.”
He goes on to say:
“I found that some of the seats recline much more than the others…. I suggest that all our seats be adjusted for a maximum reclining angle, except, of course, the rearmost seats which are limited by bulkheads.”
He then goes on to deal with the matter of shabby armrests which need replacement. He was Chairman of the Company, but no subject was too small to be ignored, in his quest for perfection. JRD’s larger purpose in pointing out these small details was to inculcate a mindset of excellence across the organisation, in its quest to achieve global standards.
No wonder Air India was, in those days, preferred by international travellers for its superior customer experience. If Indian Institutions have to achieve world-class standards, this pursuit of excellence in every detail, big or small, continues to remain an imperative. The culture of “Chalta Hai”, which permeates many sectors of our country, has to change.
JRD Tata also realised that driving big, fundamental change at a broad social or national level requires breakthrough ideas from all quarters. Here, excellence is often determined by the sheer quality of ideas, and broad-based support for such new concepts. In such areas, he therefore developed a very inclusive approach. One example of this is the Bombay Plan, published in 1944.
This was perhaps the first comprehensive plan created for the development of India. It envisaged a fifteen-year plan, with a road-map for investments in key areas such as power, roads, railways and mining.
To develop the powerful ideas which went into preparing the Bombay Plan, some of India’s best known and most gifted industrialists joined JRD. This stellar team included GD Birla, Kasturbhai Lalbhai, Sir Purshottamdas Thakurdas and Sir Shri Ram, apart from JRD Tata himself.
In addition, JRD also brought to bear the intellect of the finest technocrats – Sir Ardeshir Dalal, AD Shroff and Dr John Mathai, who went on to become Finance Minister of India.
This resulted in a remarkable document which The Economist magazine termed “a commendable piece of enterprise”. It created a stir in those days, and impacted economic thinking in the years leading up to Independence. In many ways, the roadmap contained in the Bombay Plan anticipated that of the five-year economic plans of independent India. This happened because the best minds were brought together, to ensure excellence in a seminal piece of work.
JRD Tata also firmly believed that the pursuit of excellence requires the best leadership, with very high levels of ownership and commitment. Only such leadership can drive transformative change on a sustained basis. Therefore, much of his energy was invested in nurturing extraordinary corporate leaders, such as Sumant Moolgaonkar, Darbari Seth and Russi Mody – each of them became legends in their own right.
To institutionalise the process of leadership development, he conceived of the Tata Administrative Service, the central management cadre of the Tata Group, which has produced stalwarts such as Dr. Freddie Mehta, Xerxes Desai and R K Krishna Kumar. Sixty years later, the TAS remains a preferred choice of management graduates across the best business schools in the country.
This year, the Tata Group marks the 25th year of its highest in-house award, created to pay tribute to JRD Tata’s quest for excellence. It is called the JRD-QV award, and only those Companies which reach a very high threshold of business excellence can aspire to win this honour.
As we recall the legacy of this great man, perhaps the best tribute we can pay him is to pursue a similarly high standard of excellence in whatever we do, whether big or small, in our own lives.

Tata Steel has reported 64 per cent fall in its consolidated June quarter net profit at ₹702 crore, against ₹1,934 crore logged in the same period last year, due to a sharp fall in realisation and higher raw material cost.
Income from operations was up marginally at ₹35,382 crore (₹35,106 crore). Overall operational cost increased to ₹34,459 crore (₹32,547 crore) as interest cost jumped to ₹1,806 crore (₹1,658 crore) besides sharp rally in raw material prices and pile-up of inventory.
The consolidated financials of the company does not include the performance of NatSteel Holdings and Tata Steel Thailand as it has been classified as asset for sale. 
The company’s profit from India was down 33 per cent to ₹1,539 crore (₹2,318 crore) while income was down at ₹16,091 crore against ₹16,405 crore.
Consolidated EBITDA per tonne of the company was down 26 per cent to ₹8,725 against ₹11,740 logged in same period last year. EBITDA in India also dipped 20 per cent to ₹12,908 against ₹16,068.
Gross debt of the company was higher at ₹106,636 crore against ₹100,816 crore logged in the March quarter.
During the quarter, steel prices across geographies declined with weakening economic activities and uncertainty around the ongoing US-China trade conflict. 
This coincided with a sharp rise in iron ore prices due to supply disruptions and elevated coking coal costs. 
In India, steel prices declined as subdued economic activity, seasonal slowdown and liquidity issues weighed on domestic consumption, said the company.
 TV Narendran, Managing Director, Tata Steel, said the steel sector is facing significant headwinds which has affected spreads and overall profitability. However, he said the government spending and efforts to address the liquidity crunch should help revive steel demand and prices in the second half of the year. 
While Europe performance has been affected by market and operational issues, the company is implementing a transformation plan which aims to reduce operating costs, rationalise capex and working capital and improve overall cashflow."

SBI (₹291.3)
SBI continued the fall for the fifth consecutive week. The stock tumbled 5.5 per cent last week. With this fall, the stock has plummeted 21.4 per cent over the last five weeks. On the charts, there is room for the fall to extend further in the coming days. The levels of ₹304 and ₹307 are the key near-term resistances which can cap the upside. There is possibility of a sideways consolidation between ₹285 and ₹307 (200-day moving average) in the near term. But a strong rise past ₹307 looks less likely now as the broader bias continues to remain negative. As such, SBI is likely to decline eventually below ₹285 and extend the current downtrend to ₹275-273 or even ₹269. The broad region between ₹275 and ₹269 is a strong support zone, which can halt the current fall. A corrective rally to ₹290-300 is possible from this support zone on short-covering. But if SBI declines below ₹269, it will come under more pressure. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹245-240 or even ₹230.










ITC (₹254.2)
ITC fell about 4 per cent last week breaking below the support level of ₹263 (200-week moving average) as expected. The downtrend remains intact. However, ITC is coming closer to an intermediate support level of ₹250. If it manages to bounce from this support, a corrective up-move to ₹260 or ₹265 is possible. ITC may, thus, remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. However, a strong rally beyond ₹265 looks unlikely. An eventual break below ₹250 will see the stock resuming the downtrend to ₹240 — possibly the last leg of move in the current downtrend. The level of ₹240 is a strong long-term trend support, which can halt the current downtrend. A strong bounce from ₹240 can take the stock up to ₹260-265. There is possibility of the stock forming a base by consolidating between ₹240 and ₹265. A decisive break above ₹265 can start a fresh rally, targeting ₹290-300 over the medium term. But if ITC declines below ₹240, the fall can extend to ₹230-228 band.










Infosys (₹790.1)
Infosys has remained stuck between ₹755 and ₹805 over the last four weeks. Within this range, the stock rose about 2 per cent last week. The near-term outlook continues to remain unclear. The up-move in the past week looks weak. This reduces the possibility l of the stock breaking above ₹805 — the upper end of the range at the moment. The stock can reverse lower again towards ₹765 and ₹755 and maintain the sideways move t for some more time. A breakout on either side of ₹755 or ₹805 will determine the direction of the next move. If Infosys manages to break above ₹805, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break will indicate the resumption of the broader uptrend. It will then take the stock up to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if Infosys breaks the range below ₹755, it can come under pressure. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹740. A further break below ₹740 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending towards ₹715 and ₹700 on profit-booking.










RIL (₹1,162.0)
RIL tumbled over 7 per cent intra-week to a low of ₹1,095.65. However, the stock has managed to claw-back sharply from the low. But this bounce-back is just a short-covering rally which may not last long. A further rise to test the immediate resistance level of ₹1,190 is possible in the near term. A break above ₹1,190 will extend the corrective rally to ₹1,220. However, a further rise past ₹1,220 is less likely as fresh sellers can emerge at higher levels. Also, the indicators on the charts are bearish. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average. This is a bearish signal, indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, RIL is likely to reverse lower either from ₹1,190 or ₹1,220. It will then take the stock lower to ₹1,100-1,090 levels again. Inability to break below ₹1,090 can keep the stock sideways between ₹1,090 and ₹1,220 for some time. But the bias will continue to remain negative and RIL is likely to decline below ₹1,090 eventually. Such a break will then drag the stock lower to ₹1,050 and ₹1,030










Tata Steel (₹362.3)
Tata Steel is on a free fall and has declined to ₹360 as expected. The stock tumbled 11.4 per cent last week. Tata Steel has plummeted over 28 per cent in the last six weeks. An immediate support is at ₹358. If Tata Steel manages to bounce from this support, a corrective rally to ₹385 or ₹400 is possible on short-covering. A rise past ₹400 is unlikely now as fresh sellers can emerge at higher levels and keep the broader downtrend intact. As such, an eventual break below ₹358 will see the current fall extending to ₹330 and ₹325. As cautioned last week, from a long-term perspective, the current downtrend which had begun in 2018 is looking strong. This downtrend may have the potential to drag Tata Steel to ₹250-230. An intermediate halt and a corrective bounce is possible from the ₹310-300 support zone before the targets of ₹250-230 are achieved.

Tata Steel is looking at an over 33 per cent reduction in capex across Indian and European operations, following the global economic slowdown and reduced cash flows. The capital expenditure, which was estimated at ₹12,000 crore for this fiscal, will be reduced to ₹8,000 crore.
According to TV Narendran, CEO and MD, the capital outlay for the India business was initially set at ₹8,000 crore, while the remaining ₹4,000 crore was set aside for European ops.
“We are looking to recalibrate the capex by 20-25 per cent between Europe and India. The original capex was ₹12,000 crore for this fiscal, we are cutting it down to ₹8,000 crore,” he told reporters after the launch of the company’s steel retail store ‘steeljunction’, here on Saturday.
The cut (in capex) is likely to be spread equally across Europe and India, he said, refusing to divulge details.
Tata Steel has reported a 64 per cent fall in its consolidated June quarter net profit at ₹702 crore against ₹1,934 crore logged in the same period last year, due to a sharp fall in realisation and higher raw material cost. Consolidated EBITDA per tonne was down 26 per cent to ₹8,725 against ₹11,740 in the same period last year.
Narendran hoped that things (economic condition and steel demand) will improve in the second half of this fiscal.
While the company will explore all possibilities, including recalibration of capex, cash release from working capital and cost reduction, to ensure that its Europe operations remain cash positive, in India it is looking to phase out the projects already taken up.
While this may not essentially lead to projects getting shelved, it would look to re-prioritise some of the facilities being set up so as to reduce the cash cycle.
In India, a major part of the capex was focussed on the Kalinganagar project, which was slated to be complete by FY22. Though the company hopes to be able to stick to the timeline, it would look to prioritise and focus initially on the cold rolling mill which would add value without adding volumes. It would also give priority to the pellet plant as that would help on the cost front.
Tata Steel Group plans to reduce legal entities and subsidiaries across Europe and bring together the operating subsidiaries in India.
“We have a lot of subsidiaries in Europe... at one point we had 200-300 legal entities as subsidiaries of Tata Steel Europe. We have reduced them significantly. We are reducing another 100-120 this year that will still leave us with a lot but that is one way of simplifying,” he said.
In India, the subsidiaries, numbering 30 at present, would be brought together for synergies and to build scale.
Tata Steel hopes to grow its consumer, or B2C, business and take it up to 30 per cent of its total turnover from the current 15 per cent in the next five years."

SBI can face resistance ahead
After taking a breather in the week earlier, SBI resumed its fall and tumbled 6.8 per cent last week. Though there is a possibility to see a near-term corrective bounce, the broader picture remains weak. A strong resistance at ₹280 can cap the rally. A consolidation between ₹260 and ₹280 for a week cannot be ruled out. The indicators on the charts remain bearish, keeping the doors open for further fall. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average — a bearish cross-over indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, SBI is likely to keep the downtrend intact and break below ₹260 in the coming days. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹250-245. A further break below ₹245 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹230. The broad region between ₹240 and ₹230 is a strong support zone which can halt the current downtrend. A corrective rally, thereafter, to ₹270-280 cannot be ruled out. But a strong break below ₹230 will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling further to ₹190-180 over the medium term.










ITC breaks crucial long-term support
ITC is under pressure. The stock plummeted 6.8 per cent last week. This sharp fall has dragged the stock well below the crucial long-term support level of ₹240. We will have to wait and see if ITC sustains below ₹240 and confirms the break. It has to reverse sharply higher and close decisively above ₹243 to get a breather. In such scenario, the chances of seeing a further fall will get reduced, and a corrective rally to ₹255 and ₹260 is possible. But an inability to bounce above ₹243 can take ITC lower to the next key support level of ₹228.5. If it manages to hold above this support, it can consolidate between ₹228 and ₹243 for some time. But as long as ITC trades below ₹243, it will remain under pressure. An eventual break below ₹228.5 will confirm the break of the long-term uptrend and intensify the fall further. Such a break will see the stock tumbling further towards the next major support levels of ₹211 and ₹207. It will also keep the possibilities high of the stock extending the fall even up to ₹200 and ₹190.










Infosys to remain range-bound
Infosys broke the ₹755-805 range on the upside last week, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹809.95 and came off slightly from there to close just below the upper end of the ₹755-805 range. The stock was up 3.5 per cent last week. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹805 are needed to confirm the range breakout. A key support is at ₹789. As long as Infosys remains above this support, there is a strong likelihood of the stock breaking the range above ₹805. Such a break will boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks. But if the stock remains below ₹805, a narrow range-bound move between ₹789 and ₹805 is possible in the near term. A break below ₹789 will reduce the chances of the stock breaching ₹805. Such a break will see an initial dip to ₹785. A further break below ₹785 will then strengthen the downmove and drag the stock lower to ₹768 and ₹763. In that case, the ₹755-805 range will continue to remain intact.










 
Near-term outlook is unclear for RIL
RIL fell sharply by 4 per cent intra-week to make a low of ₹1,226.8. However, it managed to claw back on Friday, recovering all the loss. RIL has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹1,225 and ₹1,304 over the past couple of weeks. This leaves the near-term outlook mixed. As mentioned last week, RIL can consolidate sideways between ₹1,215 and ₹1,305. A breakout on either side of ₹1,215 or ₹1,305 will determine the direction of the next move. Though the strong bounce on Friday keeps the bias positive, weakness in the broader markets may play spoil sport. As such, the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,215 in the coming days cannot be ruled out. Such a break will bring renewed pressure on the stock and increase the chances of it revisiting ₹1,150 and ₹1,100 levels in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if RIL breaks above ₹1,305 decisively, it will gain fresh momentum. In such a scenario, the stock can surge to ₹1,400. An eventual break above ₹1,400 will then pave way for a further rally to ₹1,480 over the medium term.










The downtrend remains intact in Tata Steel. The stock tumbled 5 per cent last week. It has plummeted over 30 per cent over the last eight weeks. The support in the ₹330-320 zone mentioned last week is holding well as of now. But the indicators on the charts are bearish. The 21-week moving average is on the verge of crossing below the 200-week moving average. This is a negative signal indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, it can continue to remain under pressure and any intermediate bounce could be short-lived. An immediate resistance is in the ₹353-355 region which can cap the upside in the near term and keep the stock under pressure. An eventual break below ₹320 will see the fall extending to ₹300 and even lower going forward. Also, as being reiterated in this column over the past few weeks, the current downtrend — which has been in place since 2018 — looks strong. It has the potential to drag Tata Steel lower to ₹250-230 in the coming months.

SBI (₹291.7)
After trading within a range, SBI began to head north and gained throughout the week, breaking above the critical resistance at ₹280. In fact, it was the biggest weekly gain for the stock in the past 16 weeks, moving up by 6.5 per cent. The weekly chart of SBI shows a morning star candlestick pattern, indicating a potential reversal in the medium-term trend. The stock has also moved past its 21-day moving average, which also indicates strongbuying interest in the past week. The daily relative strength index has crossed the mid-point level of 50 after nearly two months, and the moving average convergence divergence indicator also points upwards, implying considerable strength in the bullish trend. Assuming that the prevailing bullish sentiment will help the stock go up further, breaking a resistance at ₹292 will help the stock move towards the ₹300 levels and beyond in the medium term. But if the stock witnesses profit-booking or reacts to the resistance and slides lower, it might decline to ₹288 levels, below which the support is at ₹280.
 










 
ITC (₹239.9)
ITC continues to be held within the ₹240-247 limits. After testing the upper limit of the range at ₹247 — where the 21-day moving average level too coincides — failed to break above and corrected from that level towards the lower limit of the range at ₹240. Most of the decline was during the last two trading sessions, when the stock lost 1.6 per cent. The daily relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator remains flat, implying a lack of trend. Hence, unless the stock breaks either of the limits of the consolidation range, it is better to stay away from initiating new positions. If the weakness in the latter part of the previous week pulls down the price of the scrip further and it goes below ₹240, the immediate support lies at ₹236. If the stock declines below ₹236, the sell-off could intensify and the price might tumble to ₹224 levels. Alternatively, a bounce from the current level will result in the stock inching up towards ₹247 in the upcoming week, beyond which it will face a resistance in the band between ₹250 and ₹252 levels.
 










 
Infosys (₹829.3)
The stock of Infosys could not continue its uptrend. The stock corrected in the past week when the price dropped to a low of ₹810.85, after opening the week a bit lower at ₹836.80 against ₹840.15 — its previous week close. The stock was supported by 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bullish swing at ₹814. And, on Friday, the stock recovered some of its losses as it opened the session at ₹818.65 and closed higher at ₹829.3 levels. The scrip still trades above 21-day moving average, thereby not posing any immediate threat to the prevailing bullish trend. The relative strength index continue to feature in bullish zone. Hence, if the stock regains the momentum and goes up, it will most likely appreciate towards a lifetime high at ₹847 and even to ₹875 levels in medium term. On the other hand, if the stock is weighed down by factors such as profit-booking or a stronger rupee, it is most likely to drift towards the support band between ₹800 and ₹804 — the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of previous swing in the coming week.
 










 
RIL (₹1225.6)
Reliance Industries continues to trade within a tight range — between ₹1,200 and ₹1,240. The upside for the stock is blocked by the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, essentially lying in the same price area, near the ₹1,240 levels. A prolonged consolidation might reduce the significance of both the moving averages, unless the stock moves out of the band. . The relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator plotted on the daily chart of the stock stay direction-less, failing to provide any clue about the upcoming trend. So, until the stock breaks out of the tight price range within which it is oscillating, it might prove costly to make any directional bets. In case the stock moves up buoyed by the positive sentiment in the equity benchmarks and breaches ₹1,240, it is very likely that the price will appreciate to ₹1,300 levels, thereby moving past both the moving average, which may also push RSI above 50. However, if the stock breaks the lower boundary of the range, immediate support is at ₹1,180 and ₹1,140 thereafter.
 










Tata Steel (₹367.35)
Tata Steel edged up last week and closed with a weekly gain of 3.4 per cent. Thus, the share price of the steel major has posted gains for the second consecutive week. The stock has moved beyond the 21-day moving average, as it witnessed some buying interest in the past two weeks. On Friday, the scrip, after opening at ₹367.05, closed the day at ₹367.35 — the 38 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend. Though the stock made a high of ₹379.5 on Thursday, it could not hold on, declining and closing the session at ₹365.05, witnessing some selling pressure. Daily candle on Thursday is a shooting star pattern, meaning there are chances for reversal in the trend. The relative strength index too is nearing the mid-point of 50, and a decisive break above that level may help the stock appreciate further towards ₹395 levels. On the other hand, if the stock price depreciates from the current levels, it will most probably retest ₹350 — the 21-day moving average — below which it could tumble to ₹330 levels."

SBI (₹301.7)
SBI began the week marginally lower at ₹288.2 compared with the previous week close of ₹291.7. The stock declined further to ₹273 levels during the earlier part of the week. However, on Friday, it surged with huge volumes and closed the day with 10 per cent gain. It also moved past resistances at ₹292 and ₹300, closing the week at ₹301.7, posting a considerable weekly gain of 3.4 per cent. Before moderating to ₹301.7, the stock registered a high of ₹307.65, where the 50-day moving average lies. There’s a resistance in the band between ₹305.1 — the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level — and ₹307.65. With the daily relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator pointing upwards and the stock breaking above ₹300, the current rally may continue to push the stock price up to ₹318 and then to ₹320 levels. Alternatively, if the stock slides down after testing the resistance band between ₹307.65 and ₹305.1, it might decline to ₹292 levels.










ITC (₹238.05)
ITC, the stock price of which has been trading in a range between ₹240 and ₹247, declined below the lower limit on Tuesday. The stock retested a support at ₹234.65, from where the price attempted to recover twice in the past one month. However, on both occasions, the recovery was blocked by resistance at ₹247. As a result, the stock seems to have formed a broader range between ₹234.65 and ₹247. Even on Friday, after appreciating to the resistance at ₹247, the stock could not hold on and gave up most of its gains towards the end of the session. The scrip closed the week at ₹238.05. Hence, for the stock to start trending, it must either decisively break above ₹247 or below ₹234.6. In case the stock attracts buying interest and moves past the resistance at ₹247, it may appreciate towards the resistance band between ₹250 and ₹252. But if the stock slips below ₹234, the sell-off could intensify and the price might tumble to ₹224 levels.










Infosys (₹805)
The stock of Infosys was consolidating for the week after a mute opening on Monday. But on Friday, the stock price of the IT major slumped and it lost 1.9 per cent during the session. It closed below 21-day moving average, indicating a potential reversal in short-term trend. With a close at ₹805, the stock has also breached a support at ₹814, where the 38.2 per cent of Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bullish swing coincides. Currently, the fall is arrested by a support in the band between ₹800 and ₹804. The relative strength index has crossed below the mid-point of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence too shows weakness, indicating further depreciation. Hence, if the price breaks below ₹800, it could fall to the support at ₹793, where the important 61.8 Fibonacci retracement level coincides. The 50-day moving average is at ₹792, making that price area a significant support. But if the price recovers from the current level, it may rally to ₹814.










RIL (₹1254.35)
The stock price of Reliance Industries was trading without showing any trend till Thursday. However, on Friday, after making an intra-day low of ₹1,174.3, the stock price rose rapidly and closed at ₹1254.35. Intra-day gain of the stock stood at 6.4 per cent. It registered an intra-day high of ₹1,269.9, which is also the month-to-date high. That way, it has breached a considerable resistance at ₹1,240. The stock has also zoomed past both the 21- and 50-day moving averages. Hence, the prevailing positive sentiment opens the door for the stock to appreciate towards ₹1,300, which is a key level from a medium-term perspective. This is because beyond ₹1,300, the stock has the potential to turn the medium-term trend bullish. Alternatively, in a less likely scenario where the stock moderates from the current levels, the price band between ₹1,230 and ₹1,240 will act as a solid support, limiting the correction. The probability of the price declining below these levels is low.










Tata Steel (₹368.55)
The share price of Tata Steel looked unsteady as it began the week at ₹362 and slid to ₹342 levels, moving below the support at ₹350. On Friday though, on the back of broad-based buying, the stock price went up, reclaiming the previous week high of ₹379.5. Interestingly, the stock faced selling pressure towards the close of Friday’s session, giving up some of its gains and wrapped up for the week at ₹368.5. Comparing this with ₹367.3 — the previous week closing price — there is essentially not much change. Hence, it is reiterated that a close above ₹380 is a prerequisite for the stock to move to higher levels. Noticeably, both the relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator point upwards, indicating a build-up in positive sentiment. In such a case, the stock may appreciate to ₹395, beyond which it will face a hurdle at ₹400. But, if the stock is sold off from the current levels, it may decline to ₹350."

It’s not sustainable to run Orb Electrical Steels and the Wolverhampton service centre, said Tata Steel Europe CEO Henrik Adam




It’s not sustainable to run Orb Electrical Steels and the Wolverhampton service centre, said Tata Steel Europe CEO Henrik Adam


Tata Steel Europe has announced plans to close operations at its subsidiary Orb Electrical Steels in Newport, South Wales, and at the Wolverhampton Engineering Steels Service Centre in the UK, leading to a potential loss of 406 jobs. On Tuesday, Tata Steel shares fell 4 per cent on the BSE to ₹331.
The Orb Electrical Steels business had been making losses for several years as it struggled to compete in the fast-moving market to supply steels used in electricity transformers, in which customer requirements have outstripped the site’s capability, Tata Steel said in a statement.
Converting the plant to make steel for future electric vehicles (EV) would cost over £50 million (₹435 crore) in a highly competitive market where Tata Steel faces stiff competition, it added.
The Wolverhampton service centre and sales office in Bolton will also be shut as there are no buyers for the assets, it further said.
Henrik Adam, CEO, Tata Steel Europe, said the Orb proposal is necessary to build a long-term sustainable future in Europe. At a time when the European steel industry is facing considerable challenges, he said, continuing to fund substantial losses at Orb was not sustainable with no prospects of it returning to profitability in the coming years.
Consultations with affected employees and trade unions at both Orb and Wolverhampton will commence shortly, he added.
 
Tata Steel decided to review its business in Europe after its plan to merge its operations there with another steel major, thyssenkrupp, was rejected by the regulatory authorities earlier this year.
Since entering Europe in 2007 with the acquisition of the erstwhile Corus, Tata Steel has invested about £2 billion in its UK business. It employs over 8,000 people in the UK.
Last May, Tata Steel had put five non-core European businesses on the block. It sold two units — Kalzip, an aluminium roofing and cladding business, and Firsteel, a coated steel bakeware manufacturer. Both these deals helped to save 275 jobs, said the press release.
One of the five non-core businesses was Cogent Electrical Steels, which consists of Orb Electrical Steels, Cogent Power Inc in Burlington, Canada, and Surahammars Bruks AB in Surahammar, Sweden.
On Monday, Tata Steel signed an agreement to sell Cogent Power — which manufactures cores for electrical distribution transformers and employs nearly 300 people — to Japanese steel giant JFE Shoji Trade Corporation.
It decided to retain Surahammars Bruks, which makes advanced steels for EVs and employs about 100 people."

T V Narendran, Managing Director, Tata Steel


From setting up scrapyards to steel recycling plants to developing new materials such as graphene, Tata Steel is looking to seed new businesses in a bid to limit the impact of uncertain steel pricing on its revenues.
TV Narendran, Managing Director, Tata Steel, told BusinessLine that 30 per cent of the company’s revenues would come from non-core businesses in five years. Currently, it gets about 10 per cent of its revenue from these initiatives.
“We are planting the seeds of the future. One seed is the service and solution, the other is our new materials business, where we are working with graphene,” said Narendran.

Under the service and solution business, Tata Steel is selling finished steel products directly to the end consumer. The company is already offering several products, including doors, windows, modular housing, and furniture. “The retail business is living up to its expectations. Currently, we are selling 8,000 steel doors a month, and we would like to sell 30,000 doors. The journey has taken us slightly longer than we thought simply because it is a very customer-centric business and the supply chain was not stable. Now when the supply chain is stable, orders need to be chased. There is a huge potential in this business. It is now worth a few hundred crores, and it will grow rapidly,” he said.
In the new materials business, Tata Steel is working with graphene. With the increasing threat from alternative products, the company is focussing on developing advanced material to protect its margin and bottom line.
Its Graphene Development Centre has recently produced corrosion-resistant graphene paint and supplied graphene powder to renowned tyre companies.
It has also demonstrated the potential of graphene inks, which are used in the printing of train tickets, plane boarding passes, and RFID (radio-frequency identification) tags. Like other conductive inks, graphene ink can be used to create printed materials that conduct heat and electricity.
Narendran said that the company is working with Indian Railways to coat coaches with graphene from the inside. The company is also working on various other applications for graphene with a target to generate 10 per cent of overall revenues from new materials, he said.
The company is also getting into the steel recycling business in a big way. “We are setting up our next centre, which will come up next year, near Delhi. We are also setting up scrapyards in all regions,” said Narendran.
This comes even as the government has come out with a draft steel scrap policy, which is aimed at curtailing import dependency and making India self-sufficient by producing high-quality ferrous scrap.
Narendran said that though this business may not add to the topline as much as the other new businesses, it is also aimed at reducing the carbon footprint and ensuring sustainable production of steel. “We are doing a lot on using technology in different areas. For example, we are looking at how can we use the poor quality raw material to make good quality steel,” he said.
The online business is turning out to be another game-changer for Tata Steel. In 2018, the company had launched an online portal, Aashiyana, to sell construction material such as Tata Tiscon rebars."

Thus, the near-term outlook seems weak as rallies are sold-off. The relative strength index has dipped below the 50-mark, indicating weakness. On the downside, supports are at ₹273.7 and ₹267. Resistances are at ₹292 and ₹300. The next leg of trend can be expected only if the stock price breaks either to ₹300 or ₹267.
In case it goes above ₹300, the stock will face a hurdle at the resistance band between ₹305.1 and ₹307.6, beyond which it may potentially retest the ₹316 levels. But if the stock breaks below ₹267, the sell-off could intensify and the stock will most likely tumble to ₹260. The return last week was minus 6.2 per cent.










 
The stock price of ITC took a huge leap as it opened the week at ₹250 against the previous close of ₹238.05, which is a solid 5 per cent gain. It extended the rally and went on to make a high of ₹260.5. However, the stock could not move beyond that level and the price started to soften and slumped to ₹242.7, from where it bounced off from the 21-day moving average support.
Studying the chart, one can observe that the stock is consolidating sideways as the price oscillates in the band between ₹247 and the resistance band ₹258-260. If the stock manages to breach the upper limit of the range at ₹260, it is likely that it will appreciate towards ₹270 levels, beyond which there’s an immediate resistance at ₹273.
However, if the stock weakens and slides below the lower limit of the range, that is, ₹247, the price may depreciate to ₹240, below which it can even drop to ₹234 levels. Last week’s return was plus 6.5 per cent.










 
Infosys witnessed considerable selling immediately after the previous week opened. As a result, it tumbled below the key level at ₹800. A stronger rupee weighed down the stock. The fall extended to ₹741.9 before the stock recouped some if its losses, closing the week at ₹782.
Recoveries are strongly resisted by the price band between ₹793 and ₹800. Hence, the near-term outlook remains weak. It has also moved below the 50-day moving average, potentially shifting the medium-term trend to bearish. The RSI has dipped below the 50 midpoint and the moving average convergence divergence indicator too appears weak. So, if the scrip weakens below ₹781, it will most likely depreciate to ₹762.
A break below that level can intensify the bearish trend and the stock could dwindle to ₹725 levels. Alternatively, if the stock manages to post a recovery beyond the stiff resistance at ₹800, there will be a minor resistance at ₹814, beyond which it might move northwards to ₹850 levels over the medium term.










 
Following the bullish momentum, the stock price of Reliance Industries continued to gain throughout last week. The stock toppled the key resistance at ₹1,300, making the case stronger for further appreciation. The relative strength index is clearly favouring the bulls and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has come into the positive territory, denoting a strong prevailing uptrend.
Also, the stock price has broken above the falling trend-line resistance. The stock has posted gains for two consecutive weeks. All these imply that the stock is on a strong bull trend and is likely to continue appreciating in the coming sessions.
On the upside, the stock will face a minor resistance at ₹1,320, beyond which it could strengthen to ₹1,365 levels in the near term. On the other hand, if the stock undergoes a correction, ₹1,300 will act as a key immeidate support, below which the price could fall to ₹1,240 in the short term. The return last week was plus 4.4 per cent.










 
The share price of Tata Steel was consolidating last week, fluctuating between ₹360 and ₹380. Though the stock attempted to move past ₹380, it failed, as it was rejected by the 50-day moving average. Thus, the broader ₹345-380 range continues to control the trend.
The moving average convergence divergence indicator implies weakness and so is the relative strength index. But since the RSI remains in over-sold conditions, the chances of a major downtrend from the current levels stand reduced. But unless the stock invalidates the range, the direction of the next major trend will be indecisive. Hence, the near-term outlook seems sluggish.
If the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range, it may rise towards the resistance band between ₹395 and ₹400. Beyond those levels, it can move upwards to ₹440. But, if the stock breaches below ₹345, the support is at ₹330, below which the stock could test the psychological level of ₹300."

Tata Steel is all set to sign a deal with a new buyer for its steel unit in Thailand. The company has also received interest from multiple players to acquire its assets in Singapore. The two assets are being sold as part of Tata Steel’s plans to completely exit South East Asia.
“We should close the transaction to sell our unit in Thailand soon. We have already signed an MoU and hopefully, in the next month or two that transaction will close. Then we still have the Singapore unit for which we have received interest from buyers,” T V Narendran, Managing Director, Tata Steel told BusinessLine. Narendran did not disclose the names of potential buyers.
In August, Tata Steel had terminated the definitive agreement signed with China’s HBIS Group Co to partially divest its equity stake in Tata Steel (Thailand) Public Company and NatSteel Holdings Pte for $327 million.
According to the agreement signed in January, HBIS was to acquire 70 per cent stake in both the companies. But this deal could not go through because HBIS could not procure the requisite approvals from the Hebei government ( Northern China province), one of the key conditions precedent for the proposed transaction. 
In the earlier agreement, Tata Steel had agreed to form a joint venture with the Chinese government-owned HBIS group. Now, the Indian steelmaker is planning to completely exit the two ventures in South East Asia. The sale of assets is aimed at trimming its debt of over ₹1 lakh crore.
Tata Steel had also planned to sell its assets in Europe but in May, the European Commission rejected the company’s plan to merge its loss-making European operations with the German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp.
Having failed to get regulatory approval for the merger, Tata Steel has decided to sell the struggling business separately and close down unviable units.
Early this month, Tata Steel Europe closed operations at its subsidiary Orb Electrical Steels in Newport, South Wales, and at the Wolverhampton Engineering Steels Service Centre in the UK, leading to the loss of 406 jobs.
The revamp of the European operations began last May when the company put five non-core businesses on the block. It sold two units – Kalzip, an aluminium roofing and cladding business, and Firsteel, a coated steel bakeware manufacturer. Both these deals helped save 275 jobs.
One of the five non-core businesses was Cogent Electrical Steels, which consists of Orb Electrical Steels, Cogent Power Inc in Burlington, Canada, and Surahammars Bruks AB in Surahammar, Sweden.
It signed an agreement to sell Cogent Power – which manufactures cores for electrical distribution transformers and employs nearly 300 people – to Japanese steel giant JFE Shoji Trade Corporation early this month.
It decided to retain Surahammars Bruks, which makes advanced steels for electric vehicles and employs about 100 people.
Narendran said that in Europe, the company is aiming to become cash positive to reduce its dependence on India. “The challenge before our team in Europe is that if you are cash positive, then you are no longer dependent on India for any support – you are sustainable on your own. We are closer to it happening than ever before. If the market was not so bad, we would have achieved it but because the market is so bad, it may take more time,” Narendran said."
23,2019-10-03,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel pockets Rs 5,000 cr profit during insolvency case of Bhushan Steel 
Tata Steel has walked away with a profit of ₹5,000 crore made by Bhushan Steel during the insolvency period stretching over 18 months.
This contrasts with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) ruling that the profit made by Bhushan Power and Steel during the insolvency period belongs to the financial and operational creditors.
JSW Steel, the winning bidder of Bhushan Power, has moved the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) against the NCLT’s order. As of May 18, the current assets of Bhushan Steel were ₹7,909 crore, while its current liabilities were ₹2,742 crore. Therefore, the net current assets bagged by Tata Steel after the insolvency proceeding were ₹5,168 crore.
Bhushan Steel had inventories of ₹4,219 crore and trade receivables of ₹1,288 crore when Tata Steel officially took over the company. Tata Steel also inherited non-current assets, other than fixed assets of ₹2,028 crore and and non-current liabilities of ₹97 crore. In all, it got non-current assets of ₹1,931 crore.
Thus, Bhushan Steel has gained ₹7,099 crore ever since Tata Steel placed a bid of ₹35,000 crore to acquire the insolvent asset.
Considering that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was a time-bound resolution process, the Committee of Creditors (CoC) did not make a claim on profit during the insolvency period in the initial cases, said a lawyer familiar with the development.
Some of the other companies that benefited from the CoC’s omission include Vedanta and JSW Steel, which acquired Electrosteel Steels and Monnet Ispat. Unlike Bhushan Steel, the profit accrued in both the cases was negligible as most of the units in both cases were not operational.
The issue of profit in the case of Bhushan Power was raked up by during the court proceedings by its promoter, Sanjay Singhal, who said the initial process document for insolvency issued by the CoC cannot be changed at the fag end.
The CoC has made its claim on profit in the case of Essar Steel, whose insolvency proceeding was delayed as the company had moved various courts to scuttle insolvency, said the lawyer.
In the case of Essar Steel, which is being taken over by ArcelorMittal, the NCLT ruled that the ₹3,400-crore profit made by Essar Steel during the insolvency period should be distributed among the financial and operational creditors.
The sharp increase in demand, lower cost of production and moratorium on interest payment on defaulted loan have ensured that the insolvent company made a huge profit during the insolvency period, said an analyst.
Responding to a query by BusinessLine, a Tata Steel spokesperson said: “Tata Steel Ltd acquired a controlling stake in Tata Steel BSL Ltd for ₹35,232.58 crore. Accounting for the acquisition entailed adjustments as per the approved resolution plan and as per the requirements of the accounting standards. The assets and liabilities of the acquired business were recognised at fair value as on the acquisition date. The net current assets, as mentioned in the story, does not represent profit earned by Bhushan Steel during the insolvency period.”"

SBI in a strong bear grip (₹249.9)
The stock posted some recovery in the month of September by appreciating to ₹315 levels. However, the rally did not sustain, and the stock fell sharply from that level. During the past week, the price even slumped below a critical support at ₹267 and closed at ₹249.9, indicating that the next leg of trend is on the downside. The stock has been continuously falling and has registered back-to-back weekly loss. The daily relative strength index is below the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has entered the negative territory, meaning there might be more selling pressure. An immediate support is at ₹246. Below that, the sell-off could intensify, potentially dragging the price to the support band between ₹230 and ₹233. On the upside, the stock will face resistance at ₹260. If the stock manages to get past that level, it might move towards ₹267. Considering the scenario, traders can sell the stock on rallies with a stop-loss above ₹267. The stock posted a weekly loss of 11 per cent.
 










 
ITC holds on to its gain (₹257.2)
There was not much volatility in the ITC stock last week. The stock briefly traded beyond the ₹247-260 range, but eventually moved back into the range after facing a hurdle at ₹263 — 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bear trend. The stock has closed in the green for the second week in a row, though the gain was marginal. It should also be noted that the stock continues to trade above both the 21- and 50-day moving averages, implying a bullish bias. The daily relative strength index is above the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence indicator looks steady in favour of the bulls. The stock seems to be trading with a bullish bias. However, the price might soften further before breaking on the upside. Hence, one can initiate long positions either at ₹250 levels or beyond ₹260 with a stop-loss below the lower boundary of the range at ₹247. Look for target between ₹270 and ₹273, which is a considerable resistance zone. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1.7 per cent.
 










 
Infosys moves in sideways range (₹793.4)
The price action of Infosys stock is sluggish and seems to be trading sideways. The stock attempted to break above the critical resistance at ₹800 but failed . Noticeably, the price has been oscillating between ₹781 and ₹800 for the past seven trading sessions. Also, it could not move past the dynamic 50-day moving average resistance which is currently coinciding with the resistance at ₹800, making it more significant. Unless the stock invalidates the sideways trend, the next leg of the trend will be unclear. The moving average convergence divergence indicator is showing signs of weakness, but the relative strength index seems to be recovering. However, only a breakout beyond ₹800 will take the stock price higher. If it gets past ₹800, it will face a minor resistance at ₹814. Above that, the price could rally towards ₹850 . Alternatively, if stock price dips below ₹781, it will decline further to ₹762. A break below ₹762 will intensify sell-off and the stock price could dwindle to ₹740 level. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1.4 per cent.
 










 
Reliance above key support (₹1,308.1)
The share price of Reliance Industries did not change much compared to the previous week and witnessed low volatility. The opening price and closing price were at the same level, meaning a doji candlestick in the weekly chart. It denotes a temporary indecisiveness on the direction of the trend during the past week. However, the bullish trend in the stock looks solid and as long as it trades above the key support at ₹1,300, the chances for price moving northwards is high. There is no weakness observed in the relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator seems to be steady. Hence, any correction in price can be used as an opportunity to initiate long positions. It is likely to move up to ₹1,365 and ₹1,400 levels, testing the life-time high of the stock. Stop-loss can be set below the immediate support at ₹1,300, because if the stock undergoes a correction, that level will perhaps arrest the decline. Below that level, subsequent support can be seen at ₹1,240.
 










 
Tata Steel poised to decline further (₹333.1)
Tata Steel witnessed selling pressure last week and the price broke below the lower boundary of the ₹345-380 range that had been holding the stock for the past three weeks. The break down opens the door for further weakness in the stock. It has pierced below the 21-day moving average as well. The daily relative strength index stays below the mid-point level of 50, where the moving average convergence divergence indicator is in the negative territory. All this could indicate that the stock might attract more selling pressure in upcoming trading sessions. Even though the stock currently hovers around a support at ₹330, traders with short-term and medium-term perspective can sell it on rallies. Below that level, the price will most probably depreciate to the psychological level of ₹300 in the short term. The support comes in at ₹280 levels. However, if the stock moves up from the current levels, rallies could be capped between ₹345 and ₹360. It posted a weekly loss of 7.3 per cent."

A seasonally weaker monsoon quarter affected the overall demand for steel

A seasonally weaker monsoon quarter affected the overall demand for steel
   -  Bloomberg


Tata Steel has reported a four per cent fall in domestic sales to 4.14 million tonnes (mt) in the September quarter against 4.32 mt logged in the same period last year.
The company’s production was up 4.50 mt (4.30 mt), said the company in a statement on Thursday.
During the quarter, Tata Steel said overall economic activities in the country weakened further as reflected in low investment sentiment and demand slowdown. This was evident in plummeting vehicle sales and weak GST collections.
Moreover, a seasonally weaker monsoon quarter affected the overall demand for steel. The government has announced various measures to stimulate economic activities and market sentiments.
However, the benefits of the same in terms of new private investments and improved domestic consumption will potentially manifest only in the longer term. The recent rate cuts by the RBI are a welcome step to improve liquidity though transmission of the rate cuts is not evident and hence the credit off-take has not yet picked up, it said.
However, as the monsoon season comes to an end and the festive season starts, an improvement in sentiment is expected to trigger a pick-up in consumption and push up steel demand, it added.
In Europe, steel demand was marginally up at 2.28 mt (2.27 mt), while in South-East Asia, it was down at 0.61 mt (0.62 mt).
Tata Steel said global business confidence remained subdued during the second quarter of FY20 as weakening economic activities and prolonged uncertainty over trade conflicts impacted investment decisions and trade flows.
The accommodative monetary policy stance by key advanced and emerging economies is yet to show any noteworthy impact on economic activity levels. Consequently, apparent steel demand remained weak, weighing on steel prices across geographies, it said.
Though the regional spot steel spreads have begun improving since mid-July from the lows seen in June quarter with softening of coking coal and iron ore prices, a meaningful benefit of this will flow through only in the next few quarters.
In Europe, the steel industry continued to face significant headwinds amidst lower demand conditions due to Brexit uncertainty and trade conflicts."
20,2019-10-15,Tata Steel,"Structurally the steel industry is in a better position than two years ago: Tata Steel MD


T V Narendran, MD, Tata Steel




T V Narendran, MD, Tata Steel


T V Narendran, CEO and Managing Director, Tata Steel is on a mission mode to transform the 112-year old company. He is not only deleveraging the existing core businesses to make it financially stronger, but Narendran is also planting seeds for new businesses to ensure future growth. But with challenges like declining steel prices, struggling units in Europe, climbing debt levels and cheaper imports, the Tata Steel chief has his task cut out. In a conversation with BusinessLine, Narendran explains how he plans to navigate through these hurdles to achieve his target.
I am less negative or more optimistic because structurally we were in a better place than we were in 2016-17. At that time the big problem was China doubling its exports from 5 million tonnes to 10 million tonnes. Today that is not happening. China is still exporting 5 million tonnes-- steel consumption in China's domestic market has grown 10 per cent over the last six months. China has taken many things in the previous 3-4 years to cut down inefficient capacity and cut down polluting capacity. The more prominent companies have got bigger, which is suitable for the global steel industry because the bigger guys are more disciplined than a large number of small players. Structurally the steel industry is in a better place to what it was in 2016-17. There you had China disrupting global markets today you don’t have China disrupting global markets, today the problem is more about macroeconomic sentiment across geographies which are having its impact on steel. Secondly, look at India itself and South -East Asia. Who sets the price in South East Asia? It's not China its India, because Indian exporters, including Tata Steel, are selling into Vietnam and other areas. We are in some sense setting the prices because the Indian companies are structurally in a stronger position than most other companies. We have the scale, raw material, we have the latest plants here, so efficiencies are good. Companies like JSW, Tata Steel --can be competitive in the international market.
In India, the industry has consolidated quite a bit’. There won't be many people queuing up to invest much money in this industry other than some foreign investors like---Arcelor Mittal. The demand for steel will grow faster than supply. If you look at big steel consumers, yes, the auto sector is facing some headwinds now, but Indian cannot be a country consuming just 3 million cars. As the infrastructure gets built, more and more parts of the country gets included, how do you travel around in places where there no public transport. On the construction side, the government is realising that infrastructure is the best way to kick start the economy. Private equity is coming into commercial construction. In the residential segment, there is a lot of action around the affordable housing category.
We are pretty much on track. The acquisition of Bhushan Steel with a capacity of 5 million tonne and expansion at Kalinganagar by 5 million tonnes is anyway happening so we will hit 24 million by 2022. Then it is a question of the steel market; if it continues like this, later we will revisit, but I don’t believe it will stay like this for that long. It will pick up soon. We have two options one is to expand our existing sites or through inorganic growth. We can go to 35-40 million in existing three sites--we don’t need to acquire any flat products facility. We could look at smaller assets to beef up long products at a later stage. Right now, we will focus on integration and -turning around. Bhushan steel is already turned around quite a bit and Usha Martin also by the next year will start seeing positive results. Our focus is now to deleverage.
We put in a lot of effort in Europe for the last few years, but we were quite disappointed that the commission did not see our point of view. The focus for us in Europe is how can we make cash positive. We are also looking at how to optimise capex. So the challenge to our team there is if you are cash positive, then you are no longer dependent on India for any support --you are sustainable on your own. We are closer to it happening than ever before. If the market were not so bad we would have achieved, it but now it may take more time. India has to generate extra cash flows to deleverage, and Europe has to ensure that it doesn't ask India for any money. In South-East Asia, we want to exit. So we should close the transaction to sell our unit in Thailand. We have already signed an MoU, and hopefully, in the next month or two, that transaction will close. Then we still have the Singapore unit for which we have received interest from buyers.
Yes, we would be. We are also considering getting into merchant mining at some point of time because we have 100 years of mining experience.
Now with the recent amendment has brought a lot of clarity. The only part which we have been representing is that if there is any action against the old promoters, then the new owners should be insulated. The govt is trying to address that. But some of the cases are taking too long. The steel business is cyclical, so the value two years ago may not be the same today.
We don’t have any major plans. From a flat product point of view, we are comfortable now. In the long products, we will see as and when we require we will acquire.
We have been on the investment mode, and ours is a cyclical business. But still, Tata Steel reported Rs 30,000 crore EBITDA and Rs 10,000 profit after tax. But we understand the concerns, but sometimes panic is more than required. The enterprise value of Tata steel today is around Rs 1,35,000 crores. We want to bring down the debt to EBITDA to under 3. If the steel prices had been stable, we would have gone below 3 by the end of this year. But steel prices are Rs 10,000 lower than what it was last year. Cycles have become shorter. Earlier if the price went up, it remained up for three years. Now within the year, it goes up and down multiple years. Our job is to make sure we are the last man standing from a cost position. Tata Steel in India business is in a solid place. Europe is where the challenge is.
The retail business is living up to its expectations. Currently, we are selling 8,000 steel doors a month, and we would like to sell 30,000 entries. The journey has taken us slightly longer than we thought simply because it a very customer-centric business and the supply chain was not stable. Now when the supply chain is stable, the orders need to be chased. There is a vast potential in this business. We have also developed windows and furniture. The business now is in a few hundred crores, and it will grow rapidly. We are planting seeds for the future. One seed is the service and solution, the other is our new materials business where we are working with graphene. For example, we are working with Railways to coat inside of coaches with graphene. We have set a target to get 10% of our revenues from new materials. Third, we are expanding into the steel recycling business. We are setting up our next centre in North that will come up next year--near Delhi. We are setting up scrapyards in all regions. Another new area is using technology, R&D in different areas. For example, we are looking at how can we use the poor quality raw material to make good quality steel. We are also betting on online commerce for our products. We have an online site called Aashiyana which sold products worth Rs 100 crore this year, and we are targeting Rs 300 crore. We are hoping that these businesses will account for 30 per cent of our turnover in the next 5 years up from 10 per cent now.
Read also: Tata Steel eyes new businesses to tackle future challenges
The steel industry should be kept out of RCEP. Today the most significant imports into India are not from China. Seventy per cent of imports are coming from Japan and Korea. Our fundamental point is India is a growing market for steel, and if anyone wants to participate in this market they should come and invest in India, create jobs in India, build steel plants in India. Why do you want somebody to borrow money at low cost and build some plant somewhere and just shift stuff into India? We feel that we should not blindly follow these theories because East Asian countries didn't have a domestic market; they have no choice but to export. For example, in the auto industry, if India had a zero input duty on the car, I don’t think there would have an auto industry in India. We should build a similar story for steel - we have the raw materials, steel industry creates jobs, we create economic activity. The argument that countries which have no raw material should make steel and export, while India, with all these raw material and domestic market is not trying to create an industry, is flawed. We are the second-largest producer of steel in the world; we can’t be the second largest if we were not good at making steel."

After a subdued opening, the stock of SBI rallied in the end of last week and broke out of the range between ₹246 and ₹262. The price is testing the 21-day moving average which falls at around ₹270. The daily relative strength index indicates a bullish divergence and the moving average convergence divergence indicator, too, shows an uptick.
The short-term outlook of the stock is bullish, which could lead it higher to ₹275 level, a resistance that coincides with the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bear trend.
Above that level, the medium-term trend of the stock will turn bullish and attract more buyers, which could lift the price to ₹290 in the coming sessions.
Above that ₹300 — a psychological level — is the next hurdle. On the other hand, if stock cannot hold on to the bullish momentum and the price corrects, the supports will be at ₹262 and ₹267. The stock posted a weekly gain of nearly 6 per cent.










The stock price of ITC traded sluggish the past week trading in a tight range between ₹243 and ₹247. After a significant fall in the preceding week, the stock could not post a recovery and was resisted strongly at ₹247. Since the major trend is bearish, the stock will have difficulty breaking out of that level.
The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator is flat and do not indicate any bias. The price of ₹247 is also coincides with the 50-day moving average, and the 21-day moving average lies at ₹249, making the price area between ₹247 and ₹249 a significant resistance zone.
Since the stock has formed a good base at ₹243, it is not recommended to approach the stock with a negative bias. If the price breaches either ₹243 or ₹249. A breakout will result in the stock moving towards ₹253, whereas a break-down will result in the stock declining to the previous low of ₹234. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1 per cent.










After breaking out of the range between ₹780 and ₹800 on the upside, Infosys opened the week significantly lower. But further decline in the price was arrested by a support at ₹760, coincided by the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous uptrend. Importantly, the 21-day moving average has gone below the 50-day moving average, suggesting the possibility of the medium-term trend becoming bearish.
A significant weakness is observed in the moving average convergence divergence indicator. One can also observe a head- and-shoulders pattern in the daily chart, which is an indication of trend reversal. A close below ₹760 on a daily basis will confirm the pattern and result in the stock tumbling to ₹673, as projected by the pattern. Noticeably, the stock has a support at ₹725.
On the other hand, if the stock takes support at ₹760 and moves up, it will face a hurdles at ₹780 and at ₹800. The stock posted a weekly loss of 5.8 per cent.










The stock of Reliance Industries had a muted start as it traded flat during the first half. In the latter half, the stock resumed its stellar rally and marked a new life-time high of ₹1,427.9 on Friday. With a close at ₹1,416.3, it has breached the ₹1,400 mark and could potentially trigger the next leg of uptrend in the coming days.
The daily relative strength index has entered the over-bought territory, but the price action looks steady. The moving average convergence divergence indicator suggests considerable upward momentum. The medium-term trend of the stock is strongly bullish, and it can be bought on dips. On the upside, the stock has the potential to climb to ₹1,485, beyond which it will face a resistance at ₹1,500.
However, if the stock is subject to a correction on the back of profit-booking, ₹1,400 will offer a strong support. On further correction, a less likely scenario, the stock will find support at ₹1,365. The stock posted a weekly gain of 4.7 per cent.










The stock price of Tata steel rose last week after taking support at ₹340 levels. However, it stopped short of breaking the resistance at ₹360. But the price has closed above the 21- and 50-day moving averages, thereby raising the possibility of further ascent.
The daily relative strength index has crossed the midpoint level of 50 and one can also spot a bullish divergence, making the case stronger for the bulls. The moving average convergence divergence is also showing an uptick.
The current closing level is a resistance, and if the stock manages to break out and appreciate as a result of buying interest, it could advance to ₹380 in the coming days, beyond which it will face a hindrance in the form of a resistance band between ₹395 and ₹400. Alternatively, if the stock obeys the resistance at ₹360 and declines, it will decline to ₹345, below which the support is at ₹330. The stock posted a weekly return of about 6 per cent."

The results season is here and market players are ready for some serious number crunching. In order to understand Q2 results of the top steel players, one should first look at earnings and the operational numbers of three private players – Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSPL (steel business ) in Q1.
During the second quarter, the global steel demand was muted, and it weighed on steel prices across geographies, including India. The fall in prices of raw materials — iron ore and coking coal — gave some relief though.
The April-June quarter of FY20 was an unpleasant period for steel players operationally. The net profits of Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSPL in Q1 fell by 63 per cent, 57 per cent and 33 per cent respectively compared to profits in the year-ago period.
This was led by weak growth in sales volumes, lower realisations and a steep rise in raw material costs. While the revenue growth of companies — in the same order mentioned above was — 1.27 per cent, -3.4 per cent and five percent y-o-y, operating profits fell by about 14 per cent, 27 per cent and 2 per cent y-o-y.
According to ICRA India, domestic consumption of steel in July and August, at about 16.98 million tonnes, was muted. The consumption in the corresponding months of 2018 was 16.39 mt.
This is reflected in the sales volumes recorded for September quarter by Tata Steel. While the group’s sales volumes at 7.03 million tonnes grew by about 5 per cent sequentially, it fell by 3 per cent compared to Q2 of FY19. 
While JSW Steel did not release their sales figures for the quarter, the management, in an interview with BusinessLine, stated that the demand for the commodity continued to be under pressure in the last few months with weak demand from the automotive sector.
Beating the trend, JSPL reported 10 per cent y-o-y growth in sales volume in Q2. Its resilience against the cyclicality could be on account of higher exposure (nearly 60 per cent) to rail steel and other value added products.
Data from ICRA reveals that steel prices in the first two months of the second quarter were lower by ₹7,000-₹8,000 per tonne compared to last year. 
One concern is that the prices are lower by ₹2,700-₹4,800 compared to the average steel prices in the first quarter of FY20. 
Meanwhile, a look into the trend of iron ore and coking prices show that they have softened in the September quarter. Consumption cost of coking coal may come down by $4-$5 per tonne. The import cost of iron ore came down from above $100 level in Q1 this fiscal year to $80-$90 per tonne towards the second quarter end.
Tata Steel has pointed out that gains from lower cost will benefit the company only in the coming quarters. With low volumes, weak realisations and reduced cost benefits, the operating profit and margins could be under pressure in Q2. 
JSW Steel has stated in earnings concall of Q1 that consumption cost of both iron ore and coking coal will be lower in the September 2019 quarter. While this could help preserve margins, good growth in operating profit in absolute terms is unlikely. For JSPL, margins will be under pressure but a 10 per cent volume growth would limit the contraction in operating profit."

   -  Bloomberg




Tata Steel is looking to cut 2,500 jobs across its European operations in a bid to cut costs. According to a report in Dutch media outlet, NH Niuews, this is being done to save around Euro 830 million, and a large part of the cuts may come from the company's Netherlands operations. 
This was communicated through a memo to the staff, which is in possession of the Dutch media agency. The works council fears that 2,500 jobs will disappear throughout Europe.
The Central Works Council (COR), the workers’ union, said the cost-cutting measures could lead to job losses for around 2,500 employees in Velsen, France, England and Belgium.
In a recent interview with BusinessLine, T. V. Narendran, CEO and Managing Director, Tata Steel, said the focus in Europe is on making operations cash positive. ""We are also looking at how to optimise capex. So the challenge to our team there is if you are cash positive, then you are no longer dependent on India for any support -- you are sustainable on your own. We are closer to it happening than ever before. If the market were not so bad we would have achieved, it but now it may take more time,"" Narendran said. 
In September, Tata Steel Europe announced plans to close operations at its subsidiary, Orb Electrical Steels in Newport, South Wales, and at the Wolverhampton Engineering Steels Service Centre in the UK, leading to a potential loss of 406 jobs."

 Seven mining and metals companies, including Tata Steel from India, have partnered with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to accelerate responsible sourcing of raw materials.
Geneva-based WEF, which describes itself as a public-private partnership for international cooperation, said the new ‘Mining and Metals Blockchain Initiative’ will explore the building of a blockchain platform to address transparency, the track and tracing of materials and the reporting of carbon emissions or increasing efficiency.
Besides Tata Steel, other founding members of the initiative are Antofagasta Minerals, Eurasian Resources Group Sarl, Glencore, Klockner & Co, Minsur SA and Anglo American/De Beers (Tracr).
 The initiative will work towards experimenting, designing and deploying blockchain solutions that will accelerate responsible sourcing and sustainability practices.
 These companies will pool resources and cost, increase speed-to-market and improve industry-wide trust that cannot be achieved by acting individually. It aims to be a neutral enabler for the industry, addressing the lack of standardisation and improving efficiency. 
The intention is to send out a signal of inclusivity and collaboration across the industry. The group will look to develop joint proof-of-concepts for an inclusive blockchain platform. Over time, this could help the industry collectively increase transparency, efficiency or improve reporting of carbon emissions.
 The WEF has offered its platform and expertise to help industry leaders better understand the impact and potential of blockchain technology. It will provide guidance on governance issues related to the delivery of a neutral industry platform and the expansion of members.
 Tata Steel CEO TV Narendran said, “Our heavy industries are responsible for about a third of global Co2 energy emissions today. To meet the Paris goals, we all have to contribute and joint action that focuses on driving down emissions is needed cross-industry, collaboration and scaling up technology can certainly accelerate this process.” 
WEF’s Blockchain Project Lead Nadia Hewett said, “The distributed nature of blockchain technology makes it the ultimate networked technology. Forward-thinking organizations are starting to understand the disruptive potential of blockchain to solve pain points, but are now also recognising that industry-wide collaboration around blockchain is necessary.” 
Competitors within the same industry who research and experiment with blockchain or distributed ledger technology are increasingly exploring consortium formation to strengthen blockchain technology knowledge and potential research and development. 
This trend is reflected in the Deloitte Global Blockchain survey published in May, where the overwhelming majority (92 per cent) of respondents say they either belong to a consortium or plan to join one in the next 12 months."

The stock of SBI climbed throughout the past week, crossing an important level of ₹300; it even registered a 13-week high of ₹317.8 on Thursday. Noticeably, it has moved past ₹309, the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. After closing at ₹313.5, the stock is currently trading at a resistance in the band between ₹309 and ₹315. But the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator continue to indicate a bullish bias and the medium-term outlook of the stock is positive. So, with the current momentum, the stock will most likely break out of ₹315 and move up towards ₹335. Note that before ₹335, the stock could face a minor resistance at ₹324, the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. A daily close above ₹315 will confirm a higher peak, which could reinforce the existing bullish momentum. On the other hand, if the stock undergoes a correction on profit-booking, it has supports at ₹300 and ₹292. The stock has returned an impressive 15.3 per cent for October.
 










 
The stock of ITC gained during the past week after facing a sell-off in the week before. The stock currently faces strong resistance at ₹263 – also substantiated by the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend. Though the daily chart shows that attempts to break ₹263 for the past three trading sessions have failed, the 21-day moving average has crossed over the 50-day moving average, indicating a shift in the medium-term trend. Also, bullishness is exhibited by the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator. So, on the back of it, if the stock closes above ₹263 on daily basis, it will confirm a higher peak and will attract fresh buying interest, lifting the stock price further. On the upside, it will face resistances at ₹269 and ₹274. On the contrary, if the stock faces selling pressure, it will find immediate support at ₹258. But a break below that level could drag the stock to ₹250 over the medium term. Despite high volatility, the stock closed flat in October.
 










The Infosys stock was impacted by negative news and the price tumbled by a record level and even registered an 11-month low of ₹615.1. The 21-DMA has crossed below the 50-DMA; the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are pointing downwards making the medium-term outlook weak. However, the stock price recovered over the past week and managed to close at ₹687.9, above the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of ₹638. But only a break above ₹700 can lead to a sustainable recovery. Over the medium term, it is highly probable that the stock will consolidate within a broad range of between ₹620 and ₹700. In case the sentiment shifts in favour of the stock resulting in the breakout of ₹700, it will face hindrances at ₹745 and ₹760. Alternatively, if the price breaches the support at ₹620, it will test the 52-week low at ₹599.8. Below that level, the sell-off could accelerate, potentially pulling down the price to ₹575. The stock plunged 14.9 per cent in October.
 










Reliance Industries (RIL) continued its uptrend, hitting record high in the past week. The stock registered a new all-time high of ₹1,489.65 on Thursday and closed with significant gains for the third consecutive month. Though the bulls appear to be in control, there are some concerns which can be observed in the price action. The bearish divergence is visible in the weekly relative strength index (RSI), whereas the daily RSI is hovering in the over-bought territory after seven months. The moving average convergence divergence indicator also shows a bearish divergence in the weekly time-frame. These factors call for caution as the stock might witness a price correction. So, if the stock declines, ₹1,400 will act as a support. A break below that level could drag the stock to ₹1,360. But if the stock continues with the current bullish trend, it is highly likely that it will appreciate to ₹1,500. The stock gave a return of 10 per cent October.










 
A recovery in the stock price of Tata Steel accelerated last week as it cracked above a key resistance at ₹380 and closed at ₹399.8, testing the psychological level of ₹400. But the price has already confirmed a higher peak and the 21-day moving average is attempting to cross over the 50-day moving average – a bullish signal. The stock has also moved past the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous swing at ₹395, paving the way for further appreciation. The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are signalling a substantial bullish momentum. Importantly, the price action has developed a double bottom chart pattern on the daily chart, which already stands confirmed. The stock will face a resistance at ₹418, beyond which it has the potential to move towards ₹440. However, if the price level of ₹400 manages to hinder the gains, it could decline to the supports at ₹380 and ₹360. The stock gained 5.5 per cent in October."

T V Narendran, CEO and Managing Director, Tata Steel




T V Narendran, CEO and Managing Director, Tata Steel


Tata Steel net profit was up 6 per cent at ₹3,302 crore in the September quarter of the current fiscal, against ₹3,116 crore in the same period last year, even as its total revenue plunged.
The company’s turnover was down 15 per cent at ₹34,579 crore (₹40,897 crore). Profit was boosted by ₹4,365 crore write-back of deferred tax as the government cut the corporate tax by 10 per cent to 25 per cent.
If not for the tax write-back, the company would have incurred a loss of ₹6 crore against a profit before tax of ₹5,411 crore logged in same period last year.
EBITDA of the company halved to ₹4,018 crore (₹8,641 crore) while EBITDA per tonne was at ₹6,156 (₹12,713) as steel prices slipped to historic low. Steel prices declined by over $100 a tonne in key markets, amidst weak demand.
On a standalone basis, the company’s net profit was at ₹3,838 crore (₹3,268 crore) on deferred tax write-back of ₹1,949 crore. Gross sales were down 18 per cent at ₹14,486 crore (₹17,580 crore).
Gross debt during the quarter increased to ₹1.11 lakh crore while net debt stood was at ₹1.06 lakh crore. The group has ₹4,596 crore as cash and cash equivalents and ₹7,262 crore undrawn bank credits.
On the efforts to sell overseas assets, the company said Synergy Metals and Mining Fund is carrying out detailed due diligence to pick up 70 per cent stake in Tata Steel Thailand and a final definitive document will be signed shortly.
Early last month, Tata Steel’s step-down subsidiary, Natsteel Holdings, signed an agreement to sell 56 per cent stake in Natsteel Vina, Vietnam, to a Vietnam-based company Thai Hung Trading Joint Stock Company and the process is expected to be completed by December.
TV Narendran, Managing Director, Tata Steel, said the business environment continues to be challenging and weighed heavily on steel prices. The end of monsoon season and the onset of festival demand may lead to a pick-up in overall consumption and steel demand, he added."
13,2019-11-10,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel: After a weak Q2, what lies ahead
Indian steel companies have had a bumpy ride over the past year. A weak demand globally, primarily due to the overhang of Brexit and trade tensions between the US and China, and persisting challenges in the domestic market impacted the performance of all steel companies. The story of Tata Steel is no different.
The stock has fallen about 30 per cent over the past year, and a weak operational performance in the latest September quarter suggests that the pain could last for a few more quarters. That said, an expected pick-up in domestic steel demand in the second half of the fiscal year, possible bottoming out of steel prices and raw material cost benefit in the coming quarters should improve the prospects of steel companies gradually.
For Tata Steel in particular, the merger of Bhushan Steel (acquired under IBC through its wholly owned subsidiary Bamnipal Steel), is expected to bring in synergies on the cost front. Also, the increased focus on domestic business to improve profitability will aid earnings in the long run. Tata Steel is in the process of simplifying its structure, the benefits of which are expected to be seen from the next fiscal.
While the long-term prospects of the company are sound, given near-term uncertainties on the global front, slow demand recovery and high debt levels , a significant improvement in earnings may happen only from the next fiscal. Hence, investors can hold the stock for now and wait for sustained signs of recovery.
Tata Steel’s consolidated sales volumes in Q2FY20 stood at 6.53 million tonnes (mt), up by 3 per cent sequentially and down by 4 per cent y-o-y.








 
The demand for steel in India, a major market for Tata Steel, has been tepid. Activities in the infrastructure and construction sector, which contributes significantly to steel demand, continues to be modest. The automotive sector, from which the realisations are higher for the steel industry, has decelerated sharply.
Tata Steel increased its exports to offset the loss of demand in the domestic market. The share of exports increased to 15 per cent in the second quarter of FY20 as against 8 per cent in the previous quarter and 11 per cent during the same quarter last year. This, however, has not aided revenues much as the realisation (sale value) in the export market is less than that in the domestic market.
The blended realisation of the group fell to ₹52,954 per tonne in the recent September quarter from ₹60,142 per tonne a year ago.
While the group’s revenue fell 15 per cent y-o-y to ₹34,579 crore in the second quarter of FY20, the net profit at ₹3,302 crore is optically better (due to tax adjustments), recording a growth of 6 per cent compared with the profit in the year-ago period. If not for such tax adjustments, the company would have recorded a loss during the quarter.
As per various reports, the costs of iron ore and coking coal, the key raw materials of steel, have softened in the second quarter of FY20. Tata Steel has pointed out that gains from lower cost will benefit it only in the coming quarters. With low volumes, weak realisations and reduced cost benefits, the operating profit and margins were under pressure in Q2 FY20.
The operating profit of the group fell more than 50 per cent y-o-y to ₹4,018 crore. This led to the weakening of EBITDA per tonne (operating profit per tonne), which stood at ₹6,155 in Q2FY20 against ₹12,173 a year ago. As a result, the operating profit margins also fell from 21 per cent to 12 per cent during the said period.
That said, the operational performance of Tata Steel’s Indian operations (standalone) has been decent with EBITDA per tonne and EBITDA margins of ₹11,200 and 21 per cent, respectively, in the September quarter. The European operations have been the worst impacted with an EBITDA per tonne of ₹720 in Q2FY20 against ₹4,862 a tonne recorded a year ago.
The demand for steel is expected to improve in the second half of the fiscal. The management believes the prices have bottomed out for now and would be stable going forward. Also, cost benefits on the raw material front are expected to flow in the coming quarters and could aid the margins.
The consolidated debt went up from about one ₹1-lakh crore as on March 31, 2019 to ₹1.11-lakh crore as on September 30, 2019, primarily on account of acquisition of Usha Matin’s steel business in April 2019 and the recognition of leases as per the new accounting standard for leases — Ind AS116.
The net debt to EBITDA of the company stood at about 4.6 times as of September 2019. This has prompted the company to cut down its capex for the year from ₹11,000 crore to ₹8,300 crore."

After a strong rally in October, the stock of SBI seems to be consolidating in the band between ₹315 and ₹324 since the beginning of this month. The stock oscillated in this tight range during the past week and more importantly, it managed to stay above an important level at ₹315. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend coincides at ₹324.
As long as the stock holds above ₹315, the near-term bullish trend is not under threat and the outlook remains positive. However, a prolonged consolidation should be dealt with caution as it could trigger some profit-booking. The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence continue to suggest an uptrend.
If bulls regain traction in the coming days and the price breaks out of ₹324 level, the stock can appreciate to ₹335. The resistance above that level is at ₹350. On the other hand, if the stock weakens from the current level and breaches the support at ₹315, it will find an immediate support at ₹309 and subsequently at ₹300.










The stock of ITC had a subdued opening last week. But on Thursday, it closed at ₹265.85, above the strong resistance at ₹263 after multiple attempts. The close marked a higher high and confirmed a cup-and-handle pattern in the daily chart, a bullish signal. But the stock declined from that level and closed the week at ₹260.5, above an important support at ₹260.
Both the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator hint that the bullish trend will continue. Also, the 21-day moving average continues to stay above the 50-day moving average, keeping the short-term outlook positive. Considering that the stock takes support from the current level and resumes its upward movement, it will face resistance at ₹269. Above that level, the resistance is at ₹274.
Do note that according to the cup-and-handle pattern, the stock has the potential to rise to ₹291 in the coming days. But if the stock undergoes a correction, there is a support ₹258. A break below that level could drag it to ₹252.










The stock of Infosys continued its recovery last week and glided past the resistance at ₹700, shifting the momentum in its favour. A weekly close at ₹708.1 would mean that it has broken above the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the prior downtrend, in addition to breaching the psychological level of ₹700.
Notably, the stock closed in the green for a second consecutive week, indicating that the recovery might continue to lift the price. Since making a low of ₹615.5 recently, the stock has returned a considerable 15 per cent. A close above ₹700 increases the chance for a sustainable recovery.
It is corroborated by a rising daily relative strength index. The moving average convergence divergence indicator, too, has entered the positive territory, showing some strength in bulls. Thus, the stock seems to have gotten past the negative sentiment and moved upwards with the first hurdle at ₹745.
Beyond that, the resistance is at ₹760. On the other hand, if rallies are sold into and the stock falls below ₹700, it could depreciate to ₹665, below which the support is at ₹620.










After witnessing a positive close for several weeks, the stock price of Reliance Industries moderated in the past week. The stock declined through the week but recouped some of its losses on Thursday. Thus, it seems to have formed a tight range between ₹1,432 and ₹1,470.
Even though the price witnessed a minor correction from its peak of ₹1,489.65, it continues to trade above the 21-DMA, the near-term bias is bullish. In fact, unless the stock falls below ₹1,400, the medium-term will be bullish. But certain hints indicating a possible loss in upward momentum cannot be neglected.
The daily RSI looks wobbly and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has entered the negative territory. So, on the back of these indications, if the price correction extends, the stock will have a support at ₹1,400. Below that level, there is a possibility that the medium-term trend will turn bearish, inviting more bears.
Such a scenario will drag it down to ₹1,360. Alternatively, the price will retest the all-time high, beyond which a resistance lies at ₹1,528.










The stock of Tata Steel began the week on a positive note and broke above the key level of ₹400. After trading above that level briefly, it started to weaken as it witnessed a hindrance at ₹418.
The same price level is where the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous down-swing lies. Though the stock closed below the crucial level of ₹400, the fall was arrested by a reasonable support at ₹395. The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator is biased on the upside. Also, the 21-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average, indicating a positive bias.
So, the bullish sentiment can be expected to stay, resulting in a bounce from the current levels, until ₹395 holds valid. On the upside, ₹418 is a considerable resistance and if the stock manages to pierce through that level, it will most likely appreciate to ₹440 over the medium term.
On the other hand, if the stock price depreciates further, it could decline to the support at ₹380. Next support is at ₹360."
11,2019-11-17,Tata Steel,"How have steel firms acquired under IBC fared?
While delays in the resolutions under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) are hurting banks, successful cases in the steel sector (Essar Steel being the latest) are lending some comfort. Tata Steel taking over Bhushan Steel, JSW Steel acquiring Monnet Ispat and Vedanta buying Electrosteel Steels are instances of early success stories under IBC, offering decent recoveries to lenders.
But how have once- ailing steel companies performed under the stewardship of their new owners ? We look at key metrics to find out.
Tata Steel’s ₹35,132-crore resolution plan to take over Bhushan Steel’s assets emerged as a flagship case for the IBC resolution process. Tata Steel acquired 72.65 per cent stake in Bhushan Steel through its wholly owned subsidiary, Bamnipal Steel.
Before this, Bhushan Steel was operating at a capacity of nearly 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and had an installed capacity of about 5.5 mtpa. Though it was reporting net losses due to high interest burden, it was profitable at the operating level. Thus, Tata Steel expected to revamp the operations with marginal capital expenditure of ₹600-700 crore. As such, it was projected that the operating profit earned from Bhushan Steel would be enough to cover the interest on the acquisition cost and depreciation to an extent.
Bhushan Steel’s acquisition happened mid-way through the first quarter of FY19 (on May 18, 2018). The company, under the management of Tata Steel, put up a good show from the very beginning. Its operating profit per tonne in the first quarter after the acquisition more than doubled to about ₹10,000 per tonne, against the ₹4,000 per tonne in FY18.
It crossed ₹11,000 per tonne in Q3 FY19 when the steel market was good. In fact, the realisations of Bhushan Steel were better than Tata Steel’s due to the former’s rich exposure to high value-added downstream products such as hot-rolled, cold-rolled and coated steel, wire, rods, tubes and wires. But profitability was lower due to higher costs.
Tata Steel managed to turn the negative cash profits of Bhushan Steel to positive — a cash profit of ₹3,154 crore in FY19 against cash losses of ₹27,349 core in FY18 and ₹2,439 crore in FY17. There was also an improvement in key operational indicators such as fuel and power consumption rates in Bhushan Steel.
However, a weak steel market has adversely impacted the performance of Bhushan Steel this fiscal. In Q2FY20, revenue and operating profit fell 22 per cent and 55 per cent y-o-y to ₹4,555 crore and ₹527 crore, respectively. The drop in profitability per tonne to ₹5,062 has raised concerns. Going ahead, Tata Steel plans to merge Bhushan Steel for synergy in raw material procurement, selling and administrative expenses.
 JSW Steel joined hands with a private-equity firm, AION Capital, and infused ₹2,875 crore into Monnet Ispat. This gave JSW Steel a shareholding of 23.1 per cent, which was treated as an investment in a joint venture. 
Before acquisition, Monnet Ispat’s performance was dismal. In 2011, it increased its debt to fund capacity expansion. The company’s debt stood at ₹12,262 crore towards the end of FY17. It had consistently been recording losses since FY15, leading to erosion in net worth. The company had 1.5 mtpa of finished steel-making capacity at the time of acquisition. Soon after the acquisition, closed production units of Monnet — a filter plant, a blast furnace, an electric arc furnace and a bar mill — were restarted.
The products from Monnet’s DRI (direct reduced iron) plant and pallet plant are used in manufacturing TMT bars (finished product). In Q2 FY20, production from Monnet’s DRI plant and the pallet plant increased to 182 kilo tonne (kt) and 410 kt, up 33 per cent and 10.2 per cent, respectively compared with quarter- ended March 2019, when Monnet was acquired by the consortium. The pallet plant, which was commissioned for 2 mt per annum, is now being expanded to 2.5 mt.
But with prices of TMT bars dropping sharply, Monnet is not yet profitable, despite good margins from the output of the DRI and pellet plants. JSW Steel is undertaking efforts to make Monnet profitable, which may yield some results over the next year or so.
 Vedanta, a diversified metal and mining company, complemented its portfolio by adding Electrosteel Steels with a capacity of 1.5 mt. Vedanta acquired 90 per cent stake in Electrosteel through a wholly owned subsidiary, Vedanta Star.
Electrosteel’s troubles began with its plan to set up a greenfield plant at a cost of ₹11,000 crore in Jharkhand. The project ran into regulatory delays, leading to cost over-runs. Further downturns in the steel price cycle eroded the company’s capability to service the large debt. Mounting losses over many years had completely eroded its net worth.
Electrosteel had a production run rate of 1.3 mt (capacity utilisation of 86 per cent) in Q2FY19, the first full quarter after acquisition by Vedanta. Soon, Vedanta managed to reach 100 per cent utilisation rate with production run rate recorded at 1.5 mtpa in the first quarter of FY20.
This turnaround at Electrosteel is at a marginal capital expenditure, as per the management of Vedanta. However, the slowdown in the steel sector played spoilsport.
The operating profit per tonne for Electrosteel in the quarter ended September 2019 was $23 per tonne, as against $90 and $120 per tonne recorded in Q2 FY19 and Q3 FY19, respectively. To improve the realisations, Electrosteelrecently launched its re-branded value-added steel portfolio with TMT bars, wire rods and ductile iron pipes. Work is in process to ramp up the capacity from 1.5 mtpa to 2.5 mtpa, for which a technical feasibility study has been completed."

After seeing a flat opening last week, the SBI stock broke out of the range between ₹315 and ₹324. It made an intra-week low of ₹299.7, but bounced up from that level as ₹300 is a strong support. However, the upward movement was capped by a resistance at ₹324 and the stock closed the week at ₹321.9, moving back into the range. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend is at ₹324, making the level a significant one. But the bounce-back looks strong and will most likely lift the price above ₹324 in the coming days. The 21-day moving average continues to remain above the 50-day moving average, maintaining the near-term outlook on the upside. The daily relative strength index, after a blip, is showing an uptick, but the moving average convergence divergence indicator has started to show weakness. If the stock continues to move up, breaking out of ₹324, it can possibly rise to ₹335 in the coming days. However, if the resistance holds and the stock declines, it can be expected to decline to ₹300.










The stock of ITC fell throughout last week and closed with a loss, consecutive in the last five trading sessions. Since the major trend is on the downside, the bears seem to have quickly gained traction on the reversal, negating the breakout of ₹263 in the previous week. At ₹250 level, the stock is hovering around the 50-day moving average. This level coincides with the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bull trend and can thus act as a good support. But the daily relative strength index has dipped below the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has slipped into the negative territory. Both conditions are considered as indicators of bearishness, and the stock will most likely fall in the coming days. On the downside, the stock might find support between ₹247 and ₹250. A break below that level can pull down the price to ₹242 levels. Alternatively, if the stock appreciates from the current level, it will face hurdles at ₹258 and ₹263. The stock declined by 3.8 per cent last week.










The recovery in Infosys stock looks to have taken a pause as it appears to have entered a consolidation phase. The price has been oscillating between ₹690 and ₹725 for the past two weeks. Until the stock continues to trade above ₹690, it is highly likely that it will resume the uptrend in coming days. However, a prolonged sideways movement can be risky, leading to a decline. The daily relative strength index, like the price action, seems to have become flat, whereas the moving average convergence divergence indicator is still in the positive region, indicating strength. In a scenario where the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range at ₹725, it will most likely appreciate to ₹760. This is a critical level as the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bear trend coincides with the 50-day moving average. Beyond that level, the stock has the potential to advance to ₹800 over the medium term. However, if it starts to move southwards and breaches the lower boundary of the range at ₹690, it could depreciate to ₹665, below which the support is at ₹620.










The stock of Reliance Industries gained in the latter part of last week after gradually declining during the week prior. This hints that the bullish trend might have resumed after the minor correction. On pullback, the price marked an intra-week low of ₹1,422.5, coinciding with the 21-day moving average. It then bounced from that level and ended the week at ₹1,470.8, retaining the bullish outlook. But looking at the oscillators, we can observe some weakness in the stock. The daily relative strength index is showing a down-tick following a bearish divergence; also, the moving average convergence divergence indicator has moved into the negative territory. Both indicators hint a potential trend-reversal. On the back of these factors, if the stock declines from the current level, it will find support at ₹1,430. A close below that level would result in a fresh low, taking the price to ₹1,400. However, if the stock gains bullish momentum and continues to advance, it will retest the lifetime high at ₹1,489.65. Resistance above that level is at ₹1,528.










The stock of Tata Steel was sluggish last week, and is hovering around the support at ₹395. Since it has extended the consolidation from the previous week, the recovery in the stock seems to be losing steam. The support at ₹380, coincided by the 21-day moving average, holds the key for the medium-term trend. So, as long as it trades above that level, the stock will have a bullish bias. But a break below that level could shift the trend to bearish. Since the overall trend is on the downside, this might result in a sharp depreciation. The daily relative strength index along with the moving average convergence divergence is showing a downward bias as it entered the negative territory. So, if the price weakens from the current level, the stock might slip towards the support at ₹380 in the near term, below which the support is at ₹360. On the other hand, if the stock starts moving on the upside, it will immediately face a resistance at ₹400. Above that level, the hurdle lies at ₹418 — the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend."
9,2019-11-19,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel confirms job cuts of up to 3,000 across European operations 
Tata Steel has confirmed cuts of up to 3,000 jobs across its European operations as part of a wider restructuring and cost-cutting strategy to counter stagnant steel demand in Europe and global overcapacity.
 The Indian steel giant said it plans to lower employment costs with the “estimated reduction” in employee numbers, about two-thirds of which are expected to be office-based white-collar roles — a majority expected at its Netherlands unit.
 “The information shared with the European Works Council select committee lays out the case for change, explains our transformation programme and gives a first overview of the organisational impact,” a company statement said. 
“A transformation is needed to mitigate the current structural and cyclical headwinds and create the foundation for the company’s future success. Stagnant EU steel demand and global overcapacity have been compounded by trade conflicts which have turned the European market into a dumping ground for the world’s excess steel capacity,” it noted.
 Through its proposed transformation programme, Tata Steel Europe said it is initially targeting a positive cash flow by the end of its financial year ending March 2021. It is also aiming for an EBITDA margin of around 10 per cent throughout the market cycle.
 “We intend to align on our approach and the process going forward and engage with various stakeholders to develop the proposed decisions and ensure compliance with all European and national obligations. Further details will be provided from this point forward and detailed proposals will be developed from here,” the company statement added.
 The steel major, one of Europe’s leading steel producers, said the changes were needed to ensure the business can thrive despite severe market headwinds and also accelerate innovation towards carbon-neutral steelmaking.
 “Today we are highlighting important proposals towards building a financially strong and sustainable European business,” said Henrik Adam, CEO of Tata Steel in Europe, in a statement on Monday.
 “We plan to change how we work together to enable better cooperation and faster decision-making. This will help us become self-sustaining and cash positive in the face of unprecedented severe market conditions, enabling us to lead the way towards a carbon-neutral future,” he said.
 The programme is focused on four areas to improve financial performance — increasing sales of higher-value steels by improving product mix and customer focus; efficiency gains by optimising production processes, supported by the application of big data and advanced analytics; lowering employment costs; and reduction of procurement costs through smarter sourcing and strengthening cooperation with companies within the Tata Steel group.
 The latest move comes a few months after Tata Steel Europe announced plans to close two UK operations with the loss of 400 jobs, after it failed to sell off its loss-making Orb Electrical Steels business in Newport, South Wales.
 Tata Steel’s struggles with its European operations follow a European Union (EU) ruling to deny its joint venture plans with German giant ThyssenKrupp on anti-competitive grounds.
 The company said its quest for improved earnings and cash flows would help make it a financially self-sustaining business able to invest in asset reliability and improvements while also servicing its financial obligations to its lenders and shareholders.
 According to the latest figures, in the first six months of its current financial year starting April 2019, Tata Steel Europe reported a drop of 90 per cent in EBITDA to 31 million pounds and revenue stood at 3.25 billion pounds.
 Tata Steel has steelmaking operations in the Netherlands and the UK, and manufacturing plants across Europe for the supply of high-quality steel products to the most demanding markets, including construction and infrastructure, automotive, packaging and engineering."

An anti-trust probe has found that units of Tata Steel Ltd, Sweden's AB SKF and Germany's Schaeffler AG colluded on the pricing of bearings, according to an investigation report seen by Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) began an investigation in 2017 after receiving allegations of five companies colluding on bearings prices from 2009-2014 to pass higher raw material costs onto customers in the auto sector.
Bearings reduce friction in moving parts, helping smooth the operation of vehicles. India's bearings market is dominated by SKF and Schaeffler and is worth $1.3 billion, showed data from ICRA Research.
CCI's investigations arm, in a report dated May 6 which has not been made public, said it analysed company emails, call records and executive testimonies and concluded that SKF India Ltd, Schaeffler India Ltd, National Engineering Industries and Tata Steel's bearings division contravened antitrust law by discussing and agreeing prices.
SKF, the world's largest maker of ball-bearings, in a statement said that it aided the investigation, and that they dispute any claim of wrongdoing on the part of SKF.
Schaeffler did not respond to a request for comment. Tata Steel and National Engineering Industries - part of Indian conglomerate CK Birla Group - declined to comment beyond saying the CCI proceedings were confidential.
The investigations arm said it found no evidence against the fifth firm, ABC Bearings, part of U.S. firm Timken Co, the report showed. ABC Bearings declined to comment.
The report also showed the investigations arm considered the collusion lasted through the financial year to March 2011 but found no evidence to indicate when it actually ended.
The four firms, “through personal meetings of key persons, on two occasions shared the strategic information regarding their future efforts to seek price increase from” auto sector companies, the investigations arm said in its 106-page report.
The CCI did not respond to a =request for comment. A source said senior CCI officials are reviewing the report and that the antitrust body is able to dispute the findings of its investigation arm.
The CCI can fine firms up to three times the profit made in each year of wrongdoing or 10% of revenue, whichever is higher.
In 2014, the European Union (EU) antitrust regulators fined SKF, Schaeffler and three Japanese auto parts makers $1.3 billion for taking part in a bearings cartel from 2004 through 2011."

Tata Steel Europe has begun consultations with the European Works Council (EWC) on restructuring plans for its business, which would include up to 3,000 job losses - 1,000 of which will be in the UK.
 The job cuts were announced by the Indian steel major last week as part of a wider transformation programme as it blamed ongoing losses and continued global headwinds faced by the steel industry.
 As part of the comprehensive set of proposals, Tata Steel Europe intends to lower employment costs, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
 This is expected to lead to an estimated reduction in employee numbers of up to 3,000, about two-thirds of which would be management and office-based roles. Up to 1,600 are expected in the Netherlands, 1,000 in the UK and 350 elsewhere in the world, it said.
 Tata Steel said it aims to build a financially strong and sustainable European business, able to make the investments required to accelerate innovation and the company’s journey towards carbon-neutral steelmaking.
 Tata Steel in Europe CEO, Henrik Adam, said: I’m very proud to see the dedication of everyone in this business, determined to succeed even in the face of a very tough market. I also understand and appreciate colleagues’ concerns about these proposals.
 Change creates uncertainty, but we cannot afford to stand still as a company - the world around us is changing fast and we have to adapt. Our strategy is to build a strong and stable European business, capable of making significant investments needed for a successful future. 
During the meeting this week, which marked the official start of the employee consultation process with the EWC workers’ unions, Tata Steel Europe said it had shared initial proposals about its transformation programme, focused across three other key areas besides lowering employment costs to improve the company’s financial performance.
 Increasing sales of higher-value steels by improving product mix and customer focus; efficiency gains by optimising production processes, supported by the application of big data and advanced analytics; and reduction of procurement costs through smarter sourcing and strengthening cooperation with companies within the Tata Steel group are among the other key focus areas of the company’s plans.
 Tata Steel said it agreed with the EWC on a forward process and will meet again in the coming weeks to discuss further details, with employees and other stakeholders kept updated during the process."

Employees will also get financial assistance for gender reassignment surgery and 30-day special leave for the same


 Tata Steel has rolled out a new HR policy that enables its employees from the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning and related communities) to declare who their partners are and avail all HR benefits permissible under the law. Partners would also mean people of the same sex living like a married couple.
Under the expanded Diversity and Inclusion policy, Tata Steel employees and their partners will be able to avail of a host of benefits, including health check-ups, medical benefits, joint house points, adoption leave, new-born parent leave, child-care leave and inclusion in the employee-assistance programme. 
Employees will also get financial assistance for gender-reassignment surgery and 30-day special leave for the same. They will also be eligible for the Tata Executive Holiday Plan honeymoon package, domestic travel coverage for new employees, temporary transfer policy, transfer and relocation, which allows partners to travel and familiarise themselves with a new place. 
Besides, this policy entitles them to be equally eligible for inclusion in any corporate event where only spouses of the opposite gender were included earlier.
They will also now be eligible for benefits available under the company’s Take-2 initiative (a diversity initiative for a career come-back only for spouses). Now, any partner on a career break will be eligible to apply.
Suresh Dutt Tripathi, Vice-President (Human Resource Management), Tata Steel, said providing equitable policies and benefits creates a level playing field for all employees and sets common standards across locations.
Research shows that people are more engaged with and committed to an organisation that has policies protecting LGBTQ+ employees. In fact, enacting LGBTQ+ inclusive policies has been shown to decrease the instances of LGBTQ+ discrimination at work, he said."
4,2019-12-15,Tata Steel,"Weekly trading guide: ITC rebounds from a crucial support 
The uptrend in the SBI stock since the beginning of October witnessed a correction after it registered a four-month high of ₹351 in late November. The correction resulted in the price dropping to ₹308, where the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the prior bull trend lies. The stock took that level as a support and bounced sharply the past week. Also, the daily relative strength index is showing an uptick, and it has crossed above the midpoint level of 50. Thus, the bull trend seems to have resumed and the outlook is positive for the script. However, one needs to be watchful of the resistance in the band between ₹332 and ₹335. From a trading perspective, rather than creating fresh long positions at the current level, one can buy the stock after it closes above ₹335 on a daily basis or if it moderates to ₹325. The initial stop-loss can be placed at ₹315; start shifting it upward with a gap of 1.5 times the ATR (average true range) as the stock advances. The key resistances on the upside are at ₹350 and ₹362.










The stock of ITC has been on a decline since the beginning of November. The decline was stopped at the support of ₹235. This level has been acting as a strong support since August. The stock recovered and ended the week at ₹241.6, forming a reversal candlestick pattern, ie, a hammer in the weekly chart. However, the stock at the current level is facing a stiff resistance at ₹243. This level also coincides with the 23.6 Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend, making the resistance more significant. Hence, for the stock to perform a sustainable rally, the price should close above ₹243 on a daily basis. So, from the perspective of trading, one can approach the stock in two ways. One, initiate fresh long positions if the stock closes above ₹243 and place the stop-loss at ₹238. Two, buy the stock if it falls to ₹235 as that level is a strong support and the risk-reward ratio is highly favourable for long positions; place the stop-loss at ₹230. The potential short-term targets on the upside are at ₹247.5 and ₹252.










 The stock of Infosys continues to trade along the sideways trend. Since the beginning of November, the stock has been held between two key levels at ₹690 and ₹725. As the consolidation phase has been in place for quite some time, the oscillators, ie, the moving average convergence divergence and the relative strength index in the daily chart, are unable to hint any direction. Moreover, the 21- and the 50-day moving averages have converged to the same price level due to lack of trend. Hence, the next leg of the trend can be confirmed only if the stock gets out of this range; traders are advised to stay on the fence until then. If the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range at ₹725, the rally will lead the price towards ₹760. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bear trend coincides with this level, making it a considerable resistance. Any further appreciation will take the stock to ₹800. On the other hand, if the stock breaks below the lower boundary of the range, it could decline to ₹665. Below that level, the support is at ₹620.










 The recent uptrend in the stock of RIL, that began in August, seems to have taken a pause. The price has been consolidating for the past three weeks. However, there are certain indications that the stock might witness a downward movement. The daily relative strength index has formed a bearish divergence, a negative indication; the moving average convergence divergence indicator also exhibits a negative bias. But by observing the price action, we can find that the stock has formed a strong base at ₹1,534, and as long as the price stays above this level, the script can be approached with a bullish inclination. Also, the stock remains above the 21-day moving average, maintaining the short- term positive outlook. Hence, from a trading perspective, one can buy the stock when it retests ₹1,534, and place the stop-loss at ₹1,525. The near-term target can be at ₹1,610. If the stock breaks out the 52-week high at ₹1,614.45, it might appreciate to ₹1,665. Strictly adhere to the stop-loss as a break below ₹1,534 could reverse the trend to bearish.










 The recent bull trend in the stock faced a hurdle, and it pulled back twice in the past one month. But the stock managed to restrict the declines, forming higher lows at ₹383.1 and ₹389. Last week, the stock went up and closed at ₹428.4. It also closed above the 21-day moving average, corroborating the bullish bias. The daily relative strength index is showing an uptick and so is the moving average convergence divergence indicator. All these factors indicate a positive momentum being built up in the stock. However, it faces a resistance at ₹434, where the previous rally was capped. Hence, this is an important level, and a close above it will be necessary to carry over the momentum. Given the scenario, traders are recommended not to initiate fresh short positions as the stock is in a bullish momentum. Wait for the stock to decisively breach ₹434, and initiate long positions with a stop-loss at ₹405 with the potential target at ₹460. As the stock advances, move the stop-loss with a span of 1.5 times the ATR (average true range)."

 Shares of various Tata Group companies on Wednesday plunged up to 4 per cent after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) restored Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons Chairman.
 Tata Global Beverages tanked 4.14 per cent, Tata Coffee plunged 3.88 per cent and Tata Motors dropped 3.05 per cent on the BSE. Tata Motors was the top loser among the BSE Sensex constituents.
 Also, Indian Hotels Company dipped 2.48 per cent, Tata Chemicals fell 1.65 per cent, Tata Investment Corporation 1.22 per cent and Tata Power Company 0.98 per cent.
 In contrast, Tata Consultancy Services stock rose marginally by 0.07 per cent, Tata Metaliks gained 2.07 per cent, Tata Communications 1.68 per cent, Tata Elxsi 1.53 per cent, Tata Steel 1.16 per cent and Titan Company 0.09 per cent.
 In a big win for Cyrus Mistry, the NCLAT on Wednesday restored him as executive chairman of Tata Sons and ruled that appointment of N Chandrasekaran as the head of the holding company of salt-to-software conglomerate was illegal.
 The NCLAT, however, stayed the operation of the order with respect to reinstatement for four weeks to allow Tatas to appeal.
Mistry, a scion of wealthy Shapoorji Pallonji family, was in a coup removed as Chairman of Tata Sons in October 2016.

Plans to reorganise Tata Steel’s business were initially discussed in the company’s Q1 FY20 analyst call. According to the management, restructuring of the India business includes: merger of Tata Steel BSL (erstwhile Bhushan Steel) with the group; and reducing or consolidating about 100 of its subsidiaries into four verticals — long products, downstream products, mining and infrastructure. The restructuring is expected to drive scale, synergy and simplification.
 










 
The management was hopeful that the process will be at an advanced stage by this year-end, but was also wary about the legal and regulatory processes. The recent buzz around the restructuring of the domestic business has re-kindled investor interest in the stock."

Keen to learn about the glorious history of the Tatas, which spans 150 years? If you want to do that in a jiffy, you may turn to a colourful, 30-page comic book, brought out by the makers of the iconic Amar Chitra Katha.
Turning a new leaf in its 50-odd-year existence, ACK Media, known for its popular comic book brands Amar Chitra Katha and Tinkle, has come out with an illustrated comic book that gives a flavour of the broad history of India’s most prominent corporate house.










“The Tata comic book was a commissioned project for Tata Sons. They had approached us to do this as part of their 150th anniversary celebrations last year,” said Kuriakose Saju Vaisian, Editorial Director for Digital and Brand Solutions, ACK Media.
The Tata Story is not available in book stalls, but readers can solicit a copy from Bombay House, headquarters of the Tata Group. However, two other titles — on Jamsetji Tata and JRD Tata, two legends who played a big role in building the Tata empire, — are available on sale.
“It may be a commissioned project. But, we still do proper research to ascertain the facts,” said Vaisian, adding that ACK was open to “the idea of doing more such projects in the future with other corporate houses, provided budgets permit.”








He added, “We hope that such projects contribute handsomely to our bottomline in the years to come.”
Started in 1967 by the legendary Anant Pai, who changed the face of children’s publishing in India, Amar Chitra Katha has so far released more than 400 titles, with over 100 million copies sold in 20-plus languages.
Vaisian said that in 2014, ACK Media launched its digital and brand solutions division to explore such opportunities. “One of the very first projects we took up was for Tata Mutual Funds, to educate readers about investments. It was designed as a conversation with Suppandi, a character in the comic Tinkle, and a newly-created Professor Simply Simple, where the professor teaches Suppandi a thing or two about investments,” he said.
ACK has also created a book on historical relations between India and Indonesia for Godrej Indonesia, apart from a series on Swachh Bharat for the Ministry of Urban Development on the history of cleanliness, hygiene and sanitation in India, from the days of the Indus Valley Civilisation till now.
Recently, ACK Media completed similar special publications for the Ministry of Ayush and the National Thermal Power Corporation.
“We are currently working on a special booklet for the Future Group about their sustainability efforts,” said Vaisian."
