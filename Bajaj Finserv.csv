S Sreenivasan, CFO, Bajaj Finserv, said: “From the growth perspective we had all three engines (Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance) firing very well in this quarter.
“Generally, the macro environment is favouring financial savings now much more than before. There is a lot of liquidity in the system… And if growth revives in India back to 7-8 per cent, then clearly we are on a strong wicket for quite a long time.”
BFL reported a 36.5 per cent jump in second quarter standalone net profit to ₹557 crore from ₹408 crore in the year-ago period.
Revenue from operations was up 32 per cent to ₹3,086 crore, and other income jumped to ₹16 crore.

“We are fundamentally running the business guided by data. If the data tells us some of the business lines are not doing well, we pull back and find another way to grow.”
Jain said he expects to end FY18 with AUM of ₹78,000-80,000 crore.
BAGIC reported 11 per cent increase in net profit to ₹260 crore in the second quarter from ₹234 crore in the year-ago period. Gross written premium was up 31 per cent y-o-y to ₹2,857 crore. Net earned premium grew 28 per cent to ₹1,589 crore.

Rajeev Jain, Managing Director, Bajaj Finance, said due to demonetisation gross and net non-performing assets have gone up by 20 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively.

Bajaj Finserv and Viveks, a consumer electronics and home appliances store chain, have launched a co-branded EMI Privileges Card for buyers to get easy access to finance for purchases on instalment basis.
BA Kondaraman, Chairman and Managing Director, Viveks, said buyers have evolved over the last five decades that Viveks has been in business.
From being averse to buying on credit they now prefer to buy on instalments or by using credit cards.
Nearly half the purchases at Viveks’ 45-store chain are made via credit cards, he said. Last year Viveks’ sales were about ₹600 crore. The chain is spread across 18 cities in Tamil Nadu and one in Karnataka.
The Viveks-Bajaj EMI Privileges Card gives customers access to easy equated monthly instalment options, special schemes and a range of other facilities.
Amit Raghuvanshi, Group Business Head–B2B Consumer Business, Bajaj Finance, said the financial services company is tapping into the emerging trend of purchases in this segment.
Of the total of 90 lakh transactions last year by Bajaj Finserv, nearly 42 per cent was through EMI cards in consumer durables.
In the developed countries of the West, store cards are popular, he said.
With more than eight million EMI cards across the country, Bajaj Finserv is the largest issuer of cards for finance in a closed group.
Buyers are increasingly opting for such cards even for small purchases such as apparel and groceries, segments that the company entered into recently, he said."

The “entire GST regime” should start working smoothly in the next three to four quarters, said Sanjiv Bajaj, Managing Director, Bajaj Finserv.
According to him, the GST committee is meeting regularly to ensure a smooth transition.
Moreover, a legislation like GST – which is being rolled out on a massive scale – is bound to go through “periods of correction”.
“You have to keep in mind that this is the single-biggest legislation that has been rolled out anywhere in the world. It is bound to go through periods of correction [or] change before it settles down,” he told BusinessLine on the sidelines of a financial conclave organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
According to Bajaj, GST has the potential to provide a “significant boost” to the economy.
“Once it [GST] settles down, this itself will cause a significant boost to the economy,” he added.
Bajaj Finserv, he says, has seen a slower growth (compared to earlier years) in select segments across its consumer financing business (Bajaj Finance Ltd).
The company finances one out of every three TVs bought on EMIs and is the largest financier of mobile phones.
“We are also seeing that consumers are moving to particular product categories such as mobile phones,” said Bajaj.
The consumer segment has seen a 30-35 per cent growth. As a strategy, Bajaj Finance will dial down on segments with higher risk. Being present in multiple consumer segments and multiple product lines is a part of its de-risking plan.
Growth in SME segment continues to be sluggish, and the company has accordingly tightened its credit policies there.
“We will lend to companies [SMEs] within annual revenues of ₹10 crore to ₹100 crore,” he said.


Listing


According to him, Bajaj Finserv does not have any immediate plans to list either of its two insurance companies – Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance.
German insurance major Allianz holds a 26 per cent stake in each of the two companies.
“There is no reason for an IPO in the short-term,” he said, adding that the life and non-life insurance companies are well capitalised with their promoters remaining committed."

Bajaj Finserv, a diversified financial services major, will, over the next 12 months, significantly ramp up the digital presence of its insurance businesses, said Sanjiv Bajaj, Managing Director and CEO.
This will cover both its general and life insurance businesses for which two leading separate joint ventures are already operational – Bajaj Allianz General Insurance and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance.
On the lending side, there will be a larger expansion of digital lending into Tier 3 and Tier 4 towns through its subsidiary Bajaj Finance, Bajaj told BusinessLine here on the sidelines of an AIMA event.
“The digital world of media and entertainment has raised the aspirations of Indians in smaller towns. We intend to cater to the financial needs of these people by leveraging data and better credit risk assessment,” said Bajaj.
He also said that Bajaj Finserv has, over the last 12 years, been focused on looking at supply-demand gaps faced by consumers and plugging these gaps through the launch of technology-enabled products “Leveraging technology and data, we build products to plug those gaps. We run annual process of identifying new opportunities – run them as small projects and those that show us enough opportunity, we rapidly grow those businesses,” he said.
Bajaj said that Bajaj Finserv has a clear digital roadmap that is being worked upon by a core internal team.
“We are clear that ideas can come from outside also, just as it could come from within the company. We have a strong partnership model with fintech and insurtech companies around the world, besides large tech companies,” he said.
Bajaj also said that in the next three to four years, companies that understand the digital world are the ones that would stand out.
“The digital world is not making us more efficient, it is providing a completely new way of doing things,” he said.
He also called for a regulatory sandbox framework for fintechs as contemplated by the Reserve Bank of India. “We feel a fintech regulatory sandbox will also immensely benefit players like us,” said Bajaj.
Bajaj also said that despite the massive growth seen by Bajaj Finserv and its subsidiary Bajaj Finance in the recent decade, it still constitutes a small portion of overall financial system. “There is still so much scope for us to grow and scale up,” he noted."

0,﻿2019-11-05,Bajaj Finserv,"Bajaj Finserv (₹8,706.6): Buy
After a subdued month of October and failing to provide a decisive break above its previous high in the first week of the month, the shares of Bajaj Finserv marked a new lifetime on Monday at ₹8,750 and closed the day at ₹8,706.6.
The stock, that has been in a strong bull run since the beginning of the year, faced a correction in the month of July and subsequently fell to ₹6,631. Weakness continued through the first half of the month of September and declined further to a low of ₹6,581. However, the bullish momentum seems to be back now, after its failed attempts to break out. The daily relative strength index is showing an uptick and the moving average convergence indicator has entered the positive territory adding to the bullish bias of the stock.
Hence, traders with short-term and medium-term perspective can initiate long positions with stop-loss at ₹8,450. Potential targets are at ₹9,200 for the short-term and ₹9,600 for the medium-term.
Note: The recommendations are based on technical analysis. There is a risk of loss in trading."
