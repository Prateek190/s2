90,2018-04-26,Maruti,"Maruti gains on S-Cross relaunch 
The country’s top passenger vehicle maker Maruti Suzuki has reaped significant benefits after the relaunch of its SUV S-Cross in October 2017. 
In its all-new avatar with premium looks and host of other features, S-Cross has helped Maruti not only increase the monthly sales but also strengthen company’s presence in the UV segment. 
The average monthly sales of S-Cross were about 3,700 units in the last six months compared with sub-2,000 unit levels earlier.
“We captured the customer demands and addressed them in the new S-Cross. We are glad that customers have liked the all-new S-Cross that features a new fascia which is bold and aggressive. Not just a global design but S-Cross is also equipped with the green Smart Hybrid technology. It is the flagship model of Nexa channel,” RS Kalsi, Senior Executive Director, (Marketing and Sales), Maruti Suzuki India, told BusinessLine.
In 2017-18, S-Cross registered a 44.4 per cent growth in sales with 30,923 units compared with 21,417 units sold in 2016-17. Since the launch in August 2015, the company has sold over 76,400 units of S-Cross.
“S-Cross features best of sedan and a SUV in a single car. It looks like a SUV and drives like a sedan. The interiors have also been upgraded, a soft-touch dashboard and new-age technologies also complement the all-new S-Cross,” said a company official.
S-Cross is retailed through Maruti’s 316 NEXA outlets and the company expects the sales momentum to continue for S-Cross. With strong sales number of Vitara Brezza, Maruti’s other compact SUV, which has been maintaining monthly volumes of more than 11,000 units, and increased volumes of S-Cross have helped Maruti dislodge Mahindra & Mahindra as the top UV maker in the country in 2017-18. 
Vitara Brezza’s sales grew 37 per cent at 148,162 units in FY18 against 108,640 units in FY17. In the UV segment, Maruti sold 253,759 units, which was higher than Mahindra’s volumes of 233,915 units during 2017-18.
“Maruti has been one of the major beneficiaries of consumer preference shift towards SUV, which they have capitalised by launching Vitara Brezza and also relaunching S-Cross last year,” said an auto analyst in a brokerage firm."

 Seven of the 10 most valued Indian companies together added ₹ 69,917.79 crore in market valuation last week, with RIL emerging as the biggest gainer.
 While Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), ITC, HUL, HDFC, Infosys and Kotak Mahindra Bank saw rise in their market valuation for the week ended Friday, HDFC Bank, Maruti Suzuki India and ONGC suffered losses. 
Among gainers, RIL’s valuation zoomed ₹42,255.18 crore to ₹6,30,185.08 crore. The market capitalisation (m-cap) of TCS jumped ₹9,265.16 crore to ₹6,61,348.08 crore and that of Kotak Mahindra Bank soared ₹6,513.29 crore to ₹2,26,510.88 crore.
 IT bellwether TCS on Thursday became the first Indian company to close the trading session with over USD 100 billion market valuation. HDFC’s m-cap advanced by ₹4,390.79 crore to ₹3,11,352.38 crore and that of ITC gained ₹4,027.42 crore to ₹3,40,804.94 crore.

88,2018-04-30,Maruti,"Q4 results of Maruti, Bajaj Corp point to operational efficiency 
Performance of companies such as Bajaj Corp and Maruti Suzuki in the March 2018 quarter, especially on the operational front, has been encouraging.
Growth of 8 per cent year-on-year each in net sales and operating profit of Bajaj Corp in Q4FY18 has been in line with analysts’ expectations and was backed by good volume growth (overall 6 per cent) and control over operating costs.
Maruti’s topline growth of 15.4 per cent was led by strong volume growth (including healthy rural demand) and better product mix (higher share of petrol version). However, the company’s operating performance was affected by higher-than expected increase in employee costs and other expenses.
While Bajaj Corp’s management highlighted green-shoots of recovery in rural demand, it does not expect FY19 to see meaningful recovery in sales. However, it said rural sales will outpace urban sales for the third consecutive quarter.
Against this, Maruti sees double-digit volume growth in FY19 compared to high single-digit growth for the industry on strong demand in both rural and urban markets. In FY18, rural volumes increased by 15 per cent and rural market accounted for 36 per cent of Maruti’s domestic volumes.
Good performance along with the optimistic outlook by Maruti bodes well for most other companies in the automobile sector as almost all segments are doing well."

Tata Motors' April domestic sales of commercial and passenger vehicles surged 86 per cent.




Tata Motors' April domestic sales of commercial and passenger vehicles surged 86 per cent.


 Shares of Indian auto companies rose on strong April sales. Tata Motors Ltd jumped as much as 3.3 per cent, and Maruti Suzuki India gained as much as 2.1 per cent. TVS Motor Co, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Bajaj Auto rose between 0.7 per cent and 1.2 per cent.
Tata Motors' April domestic sales of commercial and passenger vehicles surged 86 per cent, with medium and heavy commercial truck segment jumping 317 per cent, helped by government’s focus on infrastructure development and road construction.
Maruti Suzuki India's April sales jumped 14.4 per cent. Sales of TVS Motor, Mahindra and Mahindra, and Bajaj Auto rose 22-26 per cent. Eicher Motors' April motorcycles sales rose 27 per cent, while trucks and buses sales climb 28 per cent.
JP Morgan analysts say 6-10 per cent growth “across segments is achievable” going into FY19. Macquarie analysts are optimistic on the auto industry to sustain healthy growth in 2018, “led by higher income growth, rural demand revival and rise in infrastructure spend”.
Maruti has remained as the top pick for at least two brokerages, Nomura and Macquarie, given its high volume visibility and market leading growth."
86,2018-05-09,Maruti,"Maruti rolls out Vitara Brezza with AGS starting at ₹8.54 lakh


Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) has introduced its Vitara Brezza with a new, enhanced look, and with the option of auto gear shift, priced between ₹8.54 lakh and ₹10.49 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).
The SUV launched on Wednesday will give tough competition to the likes of Ford EcoSport, Tata Nexon and Mahindra TUV300 who are already offering such technology in their vehicles. 
The exterior and interior features have been given a makeover. 
The new alloy wheels add sportiness to the SUV's muscular wheel arches, the company said.
To complement the premium look, the front door chrome grille and back door chrome garnish have been made standard across all variants. The interiors have been refreshed with an all-black colour scheme and complementing accents, it said.
“Vitara Brezza has been a game-changer for India’s SUV market. We have enhanced its allure to meet the aspirations of our young customers. They now have the option of auto gear shift, the acclaimed two-pedal technology, for enhanced convenience. AGS has been very well accepted by customers, and sales of AGS variants in the Maruti Suzuki portfolio have tripled in three years,"" said RS Kalsi, Senior Executive Director (Marketing and Sales).
Launched in 2016, Vitara Brezza had garnered cumulative sales of around 2.75 lakh units. 
In 2017-18, the company had sold 1,48,462 units. Its average monthly sales stands at over 12,300 units. Top variants (Z/Z+) contribute 56 per cent of its total sales, the company said.
Vitara Brezza now complies with advanced safety regulations, including pedestrian safety, ahead of regulation timelines. 
The refreshed Vitara Brezza comes with new safety features comprising ISOFIX child restraint system, high speed warning alert, dual air bags, ABS with EBD, reverse parking sensors and front seat belt pre-tensioners and force limiters, the company added."
84,2018-05-31,Maruti,"Tata Motors shares underperform four-wheeler peers 
Tata Motors’ shares have underperformed its four-wheeler peers namely Maruti Suzuki and M&M over the last decade. While Tata Motors’ market capitalisation has grown around four times, those of Maruti and M&M grew 12 and 7 times, respectively as on May 30, according to data provided by Capitaline.
The market capitalisation of Maruti Suzuki is now almost triple that of Tata Motors (in 2008, Tata Motors was ahead of Maruti Suzuki by ₹382 crore). The valuation gap between Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki has exploded because of superior financial performance by the latter, thanks to a boom in the domestic passenger vehicles market, Maruti’s continued market leadership and successful launches.
Compounded annual growth rate in sales and adjusted net profit of Maruti have seen it outperform Tata Motors on three-, five-, and 10-year basis (ending FY17) .
In FY18, Maruti’s topline growth of 17 per cent exceeded Tata Motors’ 9 per cent, but profit growth of 5 per cent was lesser than that of Tata Motors.
The gap between Tata Motors and M&M was 1.5 times in 2008 but the latter was able to bridge the gap and surpassed Tata Motors on April 25 this year.
In FY18, M&M’s performance was better than Tata Motors, with the former registering sales and adjusted net profit growth of 10 per cent and 59 per cent, compared to 9 per cent and 15 per cent by the latter.
Eicher comes closer
Not only four-wheelers, but the market capitalisation of two-wheeler major Eicher Motors (best-performing automobile stock) too, is now close to Tata Motors.
The gap in market capitalisation has reduced dramatically — from 25 times to 1.1 times in a decade.
This is because Eicher Motors has exhibited stupendous jump in profitability consistently in the last decade (ending FY17) — best among automobile companies — though topline growth has underperformed Tata Motors.
Based on average target prices estimated by analysts, the Tata Motors stock provides the highest upside potential of 37 per cent among the four stocks mentioned above, only because of its huge past underperformance and lowest FY20 price-to-earnings multiple of around 10 times.
Otherwise, the outlook on business is worrisome. “Undemanding valuation post steep correction makes the risk-reward favourable in our view. Near-term demand outlook for JLR remains challenging due to weakness in key markets of the UK, Europe and the US. For standalone business though, outlook is strong, helped by strong macro and likely improvement in market share trends,” said Jefferies on Tata Motors.
M&M, analysts’ favourite
Analysts unanimously vote for M&M due to reasonable valuation amid good fundamentals. Analysts expect 13 per cent rise in its stock price. There are mixed views on Eicher Motors, which is trading at 25-30 times FY20 estimated earnings. According to analysts’ target price, there is a potential for gains of 16-18 per cent in Maruti and Eicher. “We continue to like Maruti’s unique moats, though valuation (23x FY20E versuss five- and 10-year median at 17/20x) leaves little upside,” said HDFC Securities, which has a neutral rating. Elara Capital recommends to accumulate the Maruti Suzuki stock."

Decision on plant location MSIL sources said there were “many options” in respect of the manufacturing facility




Decision on plant location MSIL sources said there were “many options” in respect of the manufacturing facility


Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) is likely to launch its first electric car in 2020 with an e-version of WagonR, being developed in partnership with Toyota.
According to industry sources, Suzuki will convert the tested WagonR, which has had a great run for two decades.
“WagonR EV will be the first electric car to be launched by the company, in 2020. It will most likely be manufactured at Suzuki’s plant in Gujarat as the battery manufacturing facility of the partnership among Suzuki, Toshiba and Denso (a Toyota Company) is also coming up there,” a person in the know told BusinessLine.
‘Many options’
Sources at Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) said the manufacturing facility has not been decided yet.
“There are many options. People think it will be the Gujarat factory because the battery plant is there, but it can be from any of the plants in Manesar or Gurugram (in Haryana),” said an MSIL official.
The Gurugram factory
Currently, the WagonR is manufactured at the Gurugram factory; that may continue in the future too even if the the battery and related parts are sourced from Gujarat. Most other parts are sourced from the Gurugram-Manesar belt for the petrol and CNG versions of the car.
Launched in 1999, the WagonR has proved popular with buyers; MSIL has sold more than 20-lakh units of the car, which is available in both manual and auto-gear shift versions.
“It makes sense for the company to make an electric version of WagonR as it is a five-seater and can hold the weight of the battery better than the Alto. The company has to fit the battery, controller and motor, but all the other parts can remain the same,” another person aware of the development said.
BusinessLine sought confirmation of the e-vehicle launch from both MSIL and Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM).
‘No comments for now’
Both companies declined to deny or confirm the development, merely saying, “As a matter of policy, we do not comment on future product plans or strategy, till they are ready for announcement.”
According to industry experts, the Suzuki-Toyota joint venture is a win-win deal for both the companies and for users too.
“With this partnership, Indians can get access to future technology at an affordable price. Toyota, a top world player, will provide technology, and Suzuki will build it at scale with its expertise in India,” Puneet Gupta, Associate Director at IHS Markit, said.
By 2020, India is expected to have better EV infrastructure, and since MSIL has the maximum number of selling outlets in India, the market for EVs is expected to meet the government’s 2030 target for EVs.
Suzuki-Toyota pact
Suzuki and Toyota had agreed in February 2017 to jointly develop future products and sell in the Indian market, and also make India a manufacturing base to export future products to Africa and other markets.
According to their latest announcement, Denso Corporation and Toyota will provide Suzuki with technological support for a compact, ultra high-efficiency power train too, to be developed by Suzuki.
Also, while TKM will sell Baleno and Vitara Brezza made by Suzuki from its outlets, MSIL will sell Corolla Altis through Maruti’s network across India."

Maruti Suzuki India is confident of selling two million vehicles by fiscal 2019-20, up from 1.64 million (domestic sales) in 2017-18. It hopes to sell three million units by 2025.
“We hope that the two-million mark will be reached in the next financial year and the next goal is three million cars a year by 2025,” RC Bhargava, Chairman, said in the company’s 2017-18 annual report.
In FY18, Maruti outperformed the industry growth for the sixth year in a row. For FY19, it has projected a double-digit growth, higher than the expected industry growth of 8-9 per cent.
In the last three years, there has been a noticeable shift towards petrol vehicles, primarily in the compact segment. 
Within passenger vehicles, the company’s sales grew16.8 per cent in the petrol segment and 7.1 per cent in the diesel segment, said the report.
Bhargava said the contract manufacturing arrangement with Suzuki Motors Gujarat is working satisfactorily. 
The first production line is in full swing and the second line will be commissioned early in 2019. 
Work has started on a third line expected to be commissioned by early 2020.
He said the country’s car market is unique in that 75 per cent of the cars sold are below 4 metres in length and cost under ₹6.5 lakh at the factory level.
“As we gradually increase the percentage of electrified vehicles, a very large number of internal combustion engine vehicles would also be produced to meet the total demand. It would be better to use alternative technologies and fuels that reduce the consumption of petrol and diesel, rather than produce only electric cars and internal combustion cars,” he said.
He felt that it would be a good intermediate step to expand the usage of clean fuel such as CNG.
Kenichi Ayukawa, Managing Director & CEO, said, in the report, that the company’s R&D centre at Rohtak was building capabilities for future needs and the company would like to proceed to the next stage - Design in India."

Exports were at 26,639 units, the company said. “While the industry grew by 19.9 per cent, we grew by 25.9 per cent,” Ajay Seth, Chief Financial Officer, MSIL, told analysts, adding that demand for petrol vehicles also continued to outstrip those of diesel heavily.
“For the industry, the demand for petrol vehicles is 62 per cent of the total sales, but for us it is 72 per cent,” he said. Seth added that during the first quarter, increase in commodity prices, especially that of steel, had an impact. “Since the fourth quarter last fiscal, there has been an uptick in commodity prices. Especially, steel has seen a sizeable increase and some of the impact of that is getting reflected in the first quarter,"" he added.
RS Kalsi, Senior Executive Director (Marketing and Sales), said that more demand was coming in from the rural markets following good monsoon and increase in MSP of crops by the government.

Japan’s ‘Mottainai Grandma’ a picture book by Japanese publication, Kodansha, has come to India with the objective of promoting the ‘Clean India’ mission by creating environmental awareness among students.
School children between 9-12 years will take part in the activity and learn the values of cleanliness, use of resources and consciousness towards the environment. The inaugural session was conducted on Tuesday at the Girls Government Primary School in Manesar.
The story-telling sessions are being conducted by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd along with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The book is adapted in Hindi and English in collaboration with the National Book Trust (NBT).
“Mottainai is a thoughtful Japanese word which means ‘Do not Waste’. The interactive method reinforces the age old practice of story-telling in India. With Mottainai Grandma, these students will retain the lessons for life. We are confident that this activity will strengthen our community development projects by driving behavioural change and contribute to the government’s Swachh Bharat Mission,” said Ajay Tomer, Executive Director, Corporate Planning, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.

79,2018-08-02,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki: Facing roadblocks 
Volume growth of 25 per cent, along with a 2 per cent rise in realisations due to a superior product mix, helped Maruti Suzuki record a 27.3 per cent year-on-year rise in revenues to ₹21,811 crore in the quarter-ended June 2018. The company saw some pressure on operating margins from the depreciation of the rupee versus the yen and a rise in input prices.
Yet, cost-control efforts, along with lower advertising expenses, helped margins expand to 14.9 per cent from 13.3 per cent a year ago. Operating profits grew by 43 per cent to ₹3,351 crore. Lower other income, which dropped 60 per cent, as well as a 22 per cent rise in taxes prevented this robust performance from reaching the bottomline. Thus, despite a strong show on the operational front, net profits grew only by 27 per cent to ₹1,975 crore. Given the rise in commodity prices and the rupee depreciation, operating profits and margins may come under pressure in the coming quarters. While many automakers have announced price hikes to cover cost increases, Maruti is yet to bit the bullet.








 
With the stock climbing steadily upwards, thanks to robust performance in the last few quarters as well as strong growth expectations, the trailing PE stands at 34.5 times higher than the three-year average of 29 times.
Lower-than-expected profit growth already prompted a 3.7 per cent fall in the stock last Thursday after the results announcement."
76,2018-08-23,Maruti,"Smarter, plusher and more capable
The Ciaz brought Maruti Suzuki back into the reckoning in the sedan segment. After the relatively gawky SX4, the Ciaz was a refreshing change and represented the car-maker’s more evolved design capabilities. It debuted in 2014, but the Ciaz was moved from Maruti’s Arena sales channel to the premium Nexa dealership network only in April 2017. The Ciaz trailed behind competitors such as the Honda City, Hyundai Verna and the relatively new Toyota Yaris in the perceived quality of its cabin. The Ciaz’s attractiveness was also blunted when the Government withdrew the FAME scheme incentives for mild hybrids. So, a refresh and repositioning of the Ciaz was overdue.
Earlier this week, Maruti unveiled a face-lift with its 2018 model and it is noteworthy that despite the change in policy, instead of discontinuing the mild hybrid system, has decided to go ahead and make it more capable. Company officials say that they want to use the experience of developing the new smart hybrid system to hone their skills for launching electrics within the next few years.
Design
The new Ciaz’s facelift is not significant in that there are no changes to the body panels, yet it delivers a lot of impact in terms of how much more desirable it looks. The exterior changes are mostly only cosmetic and focus on changes to the electrical and plastic parts. But, the new headlamp configuration with LED daytime running lights (DRLs) and LED fog lamps combine to deliver a white light signature at the front, which is very much like in a luxury sedan. The new bonnet grille with its 3D design and chrome elements is the other change. In fact, there are a lot of chrome additions, including the oversized garnish around the fog lamps in the new fender. More accented skirts in the fender and other changes give the new Ciaz a sharper, more aggressive front fascia.








 
Most of the changes to the exterior design of the 2018 Ciaz focus on giving it a bigger sedan look. The chrome strip that runs down the window beltline and the new multi-spoke cut alloy wheels contribute to that impression. At the rear, the new tail lamps see the addition of LED tubes, though they continue to feature the same basic design. More chrome garnishes attempt to add premiumness to the rear of the new Ciaz. The rear fender has been carried forward except that the top two variants get the addition of chrome or silver ornaments around the bumper reflectors. Many of the changes to the lights and accents are only available in the top two — Zeta and Alpha — variants. But given that nearly a half of all Ciaz sales is the top-end trim, most buyers can expect to see these changes as part of the package.
Cabin
One of the Ciaz’s weaker points was a lower perceived quality of the cabin compared to the competitors in its peer group. The issue has been largely dealt with and addressed in the new face-lifted Ciaz. My test mule was the top-end petrol Ciaz; it sported creamy beige-coloured leatherette seats and a dual-tone dashboard in dark grey and the same creamy beige. But, to break the monotony of the plastic panels, the dashboard and door trims also featured satin chrome strips and highlights. Also running across the length of the dashboard is a new Birch blonde wood grain accent in a low-gloss finish, which adds a touch of sophistication to the cabin.








 
The cabin also features the 4.3-inch multi-information coloured display unit at the top of the centre stack. The steering wheel also gets infotainment controls and the addition of cruise control. The instrument cluster gets a minor modification in layout and display pattern; also gets eco-illumination, which changes colour based on the driving pattern. The Ciaz’s cabin was always quite spacious and there is no change there. The boot volume is also a sizeable 510 litres. There are a few safety regulation-based changes that Maruti has taken the lead to implement in the new Ciaz ahead of schedule. They include audible warnings for preset speed limits, driver and front passenger seat-belt reminders and reverse parking sensors. These and ISOFIX child seat restraint system, dual airbags and ABS with EBD are all standard across variants. The speed warning beep can be quite annoying since it rings non-stop after the car crosses the 120 kmph mark. The feature cannot be deactivated and is mandatory by law in all cars after April 2019.
Smart Hybrid
The new Smart Hybrid system in the 2018 Ciaz is a substantial change over the simple start/stop system of its predecessor. The new system gets a compact lithium-ion battery and more capability. In addition to the standard mild hybrid functions like idle, start/stop and brake energy regeneration, the new smart version features a 2.5 kW electric motor that offers torque assist also. Behaving essentially like a parallel assist system, the battery-driven motor offers additional boost to the torque delivered by the engine. Maruti officials say that it is difficult to put a number on the exact amount of assistance offered. But the motor helps deliver a cut in the emissions during the initial combustion cycle and also helps boost mileage marginally.
The new compact Lithium-ion battery is said to be capable of longer service life and also handles quicker charging-up and discharge cycles better. It enables the motor’s torque assist when it has a minimum charge of 30 per cent. The other electricals continue to be powered by a regular maintenance-free lead-acid battery. The mild hybrid power management system is designed to allow regenerative braking to charge up the lithium-ion battery first and the spill over if any to also juice up the regular battery pack. The smart hybrid system is standard across all variants and for both the petrol and diesel powertrains.
Performance
Maruti had organised a test drive of the 2018 Ciaz and the only powertrain made available was the new 1.5-litre K15 petrol engine paired with the five-speed manual and the four-speed automatic. I didn’t get to drive the 1.3-litre DSiS diesel engine, which doesn’t see any change in its performance parameters, except the addition of the torque assist function.
The new K15 petrol engine is essentially the same basic platform of the previous model’s K14, but now gets a larger bore and stroke (74 mm x 85 mm) to offer a 1,462 cc capacity. This engine combined with the smart hybrid system delivers 77 kW of peak power and 138 Nm of peak torque, both of which are up 13 per cent and six per cent respectively over the predecessor.
The K15 engine feels peppy and free-revving in the manual gearbox variant, with the smart hybrid motor’s torque assist probably helping in marginally improving acceleration from slow speeds. But, the four-speed automatic does feel more laboured and louder before expected levels of acceleration can be experienced. There is no manual, sport or triptronic mode in the auto gearbox, but there are two low gear ‘L’ and ‘2’ modes, both of which are expected to help handle high-rev, high torque demand such as during a hill climb, and the transmission stays in the first gear and second gear respectively.
Bottom Line
The new Ciaz is a substantial improvement over its predecessor. The ride quality was never a sore point and it continues to be good in the 2018 model. The steering is over-assisted and expectedly light, tuned for the city. With assistance from the smart hybrid system, the powertrains are also rated to deliver a mileage of 21.56 kmpl and 28.09 kmpl for the manual diesel and petrol variants respectively. Ex-showroom prices for the new Ciaz range from ₹8.19 lakh to ₹10.97 lakh."

Biofuel will not only reduce India’s import dependence but also help create a cleaner environment
   -  aydinmutlu


With consumers demanding cost-effective and fuel-efficient vehicles, and the government pushing for cleaner fuel as well as reducing import dependence, the onus is now on auto makers and oil refiners to offer such products.
In keeping with this demand, auto makers, including Maruti Suzuki India and refiners, including public sector giant Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), have joined forces to offer the best.
Tests are happening at various levels at the IndianOil Research & Development Centre and other places to work on various specifications of blending biofuel — ethanol blended petrol/diesel and engine configuration that could help save fuel and lead to better mileage.
While approving the National Policy on Biofuels. the government had observed that it would not only reduce import dependence but also help create a cleaner environment. Sources at Maruti Suzuki said that the company was not only working with IndianOil, but also with NITI Aayog and Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) for testing of the engines at various levels, and design.
CV Raman, Senior Executive Director (Engineering), Maruti Suzuki, told BusinessLine that “Methanol blended fuel is a very different fuel as compared to current fuel. In order to understand the impact of the fuel on engines and vehicles in terms of material, emission, efficiency and driving behaviour, a comprehensive check is required. Based on this, proper design changes can be implemented to make vehicles compliant. Maruti Suzuki is actively working with NITI Aayog for conducting this evaluation.”
Work is also happening on taking e10 (10 per cent blending) to e20 (20 per cent).
According to industry sources, ethanol-blended petrol costs may not be expensive because the current procurement price of ethanol in India is lower than the international price of petrol. 
Reduction of GST on ethanol in July from 18 per cent to 5 per cent has also helped ethanol-blending programme. In e10 and e20 blends of petrol, ethanol component will be higher and this will impact petrol price positively, oil refiners argue.
SSV Ramakumar, Director (R&D), IndianOil said, “Currently, for Maruti Suzuki, we are using different blends to further fine-tune the engine.""
He said that IndianOil R&D, Indian Institute of Petroleum at Dehradun and Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) conduct a joint study for such purposes. “There are extensive discussions among all stakeholders before formalising the specifications,” he said adding that “among various issues deliberated flexi-engines is one subject. It has to happen sometime, but it is for the car makers to decide.” Ramakumar also said that the draft of e20 specifications have been circulated among stakeholders and field evaluations are underway. 
It is based on the suggestions made and the draft formalised that BIS notifies them, he added.
According to industry experts, world over, industries are looking at alternatives to fossil fuels, including electric vehicles as the price of crude oil has been fluctuating in the world market and has increased significantly in the recent past. 
Such unforeseen escalations in crude oil prices are severely straining economies the world over, particularly those of the developing countries.
The National Policy on Biofuels has also noted that India’s energy security would remain vulnerable until alternative fuels to substitute/ supplement petro-based fuels are developed based on indigenously produced renewable feedstocks.
In biofuels, the country has a ray of hope in providing energy security. Biofuels are environment-friendly fuels and their utilisation would address global concerns about containment of carbon emissions. 
The transportation sector has been identified as a major polluting sector. Use of biofuels has therefore become compelling in view of the tightening automotive vehicle emission standards to curb air pollution, it noted.
Therefore, a company like Maruti Suzuki, which is also the largest car manufacturer in the country, has to look at such alternatives. The company has more than 50 variants of vehicles right now and needs to pull up its socks to offer alternative fuel options. It already has CNG-run vehicles and will be launching an electric car by 2020."

Ensuring the best outcome Training at a Dojo centre




Ensuring the best outcome Training at a Dojo centre


It is the largest car producer in India by miles but Maruti Suzuki has not let complacency come in its way.
The company continues to push the envelope on optimising output with minimal defects on the shop floor. As a result, there is no compromise on quality.
As part of this drive, Maruti recently commissioned ‘Dojo’ training centres with its vendor partners. The idea is to maintain top-class quality at the supplier’s end.
But then what does Dojo mean? It is a Japanese term, which translates into ‘place or the way’. You can find it displayed in a hall or space for intensive learning or meditation. It can also be found in temples and in the field of martial arts.
Grassroot-level training
However, in the industry, it becomes synonymous with training from the grassroot-level. It is in this context that Maruti uses Dojo to help its vendors set up such halls or enclosed areas in their facilities to train new workers. One of its largest suppliers, Uno Minda has a facility in Manesar (Haryana) that houses the first Dojo centre. Maruti helped set it up in 2016 and it has since been a big help to other suppliers, be it Tier 1 or Tier 2.
“We want to impart training that makes the worker adept at various standard practices before he joins the shop floor,” says NK Minda, Chairman and Managing Director, Uno Minda. This has helped keep attrition levels low while boosting confidence of workers even in the initial period.
According to Minda, the company has trained over 400 people so far in various batches of 20 to 25 each. The 17-day programme is divided into various modules with each focussed on making the workers adept in handling a slew of tasks on the shop floor. 
This initiative got a fillip after Osamu Suzuki, Chairman of Suzuki Motor Corporation, reiterated his support for the Government’s ‘Make in India’ vision at a recent event. He urged the industry to add ‘Quality in India’ as part of this effort, which puts in context the importance of Dojo.
“It (Dojo) brings in loyalty as workers see growth and understand that continuous skilling opens up avenues for career progression. We believe in friendly policies to retain employees. Operators are able to ladder up as they keep skilling themselves,” says Minda.
Training has been part and parcel of the company’s culture but Dojo has made it more structured. As a result, skilling, re-skilling and right skilling can be institutionalised as an integral part of the ecosystem.
Expanding Dojo
Maruti has now decided to set up Dojo training centres at all its 400-plus vendor partners by 2020. Beyond Uno Minda, it already has 90 Dojo centres functioning well with suppliers such as Sanden Vikas, Mindarika, SKH Metals, JBML and Asahi Glass.
There are different Dojos for different types of work, be it lights, HVAC or the engine (which depends upon parts used). These are curriculum-driven trainings while there are also practical demonstrations for fitting as well as explanation of materials that go into various parts so that every component is familiar to the worker. “Familiarisation with the range of defects (age-related/manufacturing-related/handling-related, etc) is taught,” explains Ajay K Tomer, Executive Director (Corporate Planning), Maruti Suzuki. For instance, in the screw fitting area, the focus is on hand-eye coordination, differentiation between different screws and components, segregation in order to optimise time, and so on.
Training also includes ‘hand movement’ for sensitisation of correct movements to fast-track processes on the shop floor. There is continuous training on which part goes where and in which order.
‘Safety Dojo’ is also an important part of the training process. According to Tomer, workers are taught what not to touch while personal protective equipment methodologies go into greater detailing on handling emergencies like fire."

Except for a few commercial vehicle players and two-wheeler makers, most automobile companies reported a decline in sales or, at best, a marginal growth in September. This was mainly due to a higher base in the corresponding month last year and subdued demand in the North India due to the shradh period.
For instance, in the passenger car segment, market leader Maruti Suzuki India reported a decline in sales year-on-year (YoY) to around 1.15 lakh units in September 2018, against 1.17 lakh units in September 2017. .
However, in the total domestic passenger vehicles segment sales, it managed to grow marginally at more than 1.51 lakh units during the month, against 1.50 lakh units last year.
Toyota Kirloskar Motor also managed to grow marginally during the month, led by strong demand in the Crysta, Fortuner, Yaris and Etios Liva.
Creta maker Hyundai Motor India reported a 5 per cent drop in YoY sales to 47,781 units (50,028 units). Similarly, Honda Cars India reported a 19 per cent decline in sales to 14,820 units (18,257 units).








 
Home-grown Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) also reported a 16 per cent decline in sales to 21,411 units (25,414 units).
“September has been muted for passenger vehicles due to factors such as low consumer buying sentiment, high fuel prices and the effect of monsoon in many parts of the country,” said Rajan Wadhera, President, Automotive Sector, M&M.
However, Tata Motors reported a 7 per cent growth to 18,429 units last month (17,286 units) due to continued demand from new-generation vehicles, the company said.
“We expect sales to pick up this festival season and, to boost our customer morale, we are bringing four new products to the market. We have already launched the Nexon KRAZ and the Tiago NRG and are now gearing up for our third product launch, scheduled for October 10,” said Mayank Pareek, President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors.
In the two-wheeler segment, market leader Hero MotoCorp reported its highest-ever monthly sales at 7.69 lakh units during the month, up around 7 per cent as compared with around 7.21 lakh units in September 2017.
TVS Motor Company, Royal Enfield and Suzuki Motorcycle India also reported growth in their sales.

Adjusted for one-offs of ₹200 crore in other operating income, Maruti Suzuki’s second quarter EBITDA at ₹3,230 crore (-12 per cent yoy, +4 per cent qoq) came in line with our expectation. Due to the combined impact of increasing fuel prices, higher insurance cost and rising interest rates, vehicle demand has softened over the last 2-3 months with even festivals failing to bring cheer.
While carmakers have increased discounts to revive demand, our channel checks indicate that challenges still persist. Considering the slowdown, we cut FY19/ FY20 volume growth estimates to 8 per cent/9 per cent (12 per cent earlier) and trim margin assumptions as well, leading to a 11 per cent/13 per cent cut in EPS. 
Long-term story intact
While rising fuel cost and interest rates can impact near-term demand, we believe the long-term growth potential of the market remains intact as cars have become an aspirational item for the working youth. We think MSIL is best placed to capitalize on this potential due to its largest network; that said, new model launches would be crucial as, over the last three years, growth for MSIL as well for industry players has stemmed from the same. 
However, MSIL remains a good long-term story due to low car penetration in India.

67,2018-11-29,Maruti,"New Ertiga brings fresh appeal to MPV segment
The multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) segment is the most unglamourous in the Indian car market. But, with joint families being more the norm than the exception, almost every car buyer is tempted to consider one, usually as his or her second vehicle. However, most buyers loathe the dowdy, ‘fatherly’ image that MPVs and family vans, on average, tend to represent. Also, many MPVs run the risk of being considered people movers if they become popular amongst fleet operators and taxis.
The Toyota Innova and the Maruti Suzuki Ertiga are the only two MPVs that have managed to beat the image problem and have been popular in both the fleet or institutional buyer and the individual buyer segments. Many others have tried and have fallen by the wayside with negligible sales. Maruti is of course an old hand in the business of affordable MPVs, offering the Omni, the Versa and then the EECO in its line-up even before the Ertiga joined them. With changes in product driven by new regulations becoming inevitable, the focus has shifted towards the Ertiga, which too needs to evolve to adhere to the new safety and emissions rules.
The complete overhaul of the Ertiga for the 2019 model year is Maruti’s answer to an evolving market for MPVs. A sedan-like countenance and feature list, and additions like the K15 petrol engine from the Ciaz, as also the Smart Hybrid technology from the sedan make the new Ertiga seem very promising on paper. Does it feel equally interesting to drive, and should you hit the pause button on that sedan you’ve been eyeing and choose the new Ertiga instead?
The previous generation Ertiga, launched in 2012, looked a little ungainly, but its design was saved by the obvious carry-overs from the Swift. But, that still left it looking disproportionate and too focussed on practicality. The new gen Ertiga corrects that by adopting a completely fresh design language. Maruti’s vehicles have hardly been known to follow a family lineage design philosophy and the new gen Ertiga is one more example. An aggressive, youthful front profile has been attempted with the new sleeker, sedan-like headlamps that seem connected to the bonnet grille and the dual-tone, oversized fender with integrated airdam.
The new Ertiga has been built on the fifth generation Heartect platform just like the Swift. The new platform is lighter but more rigid and helps the Ertiga meet stricter crash safety norms for frontal offset and side impact, as also pedestrian protection regulations. The 2019 Ertiga has also grown in proportions; it is longer, taller and wider. But the new design manages to hide its larger size, especially at the rear, where the Volvo-like new vertical combination for the tail-lamps makes the Ertiga look more like a crossover than an MPV. Also abetting the deception is the floating roof concept created by a part of the C-pillar being covered by the large rear quarter glass merging into the tailgate just above the tail lamps (very much like in the Swift). Despite a fairly compact rear glass, the Ertiga still gets a big greenhouse thanks to large windows, which contribute to an airy cabin. The new Ertiga’s design has also led to the A-pillar becoming more angled with a mild reduction in the front blind-spot. Another highlight are the new 15-inch, multi-spoke alloy wheels (top-trim).
The new Ertiga’s cabin is a refreshing change compared to the outgoing model. It just feels so much cleaner, brighter and better finished than the previous generation. Again the finish quality and features of the cabin are a mix of sedan-like feel and practicality. The extra length for the new gen Ertiga, from the longer rear overhang, delivers more space in the cabin. This finally feels like a seven-seater, with the two reclining seats of the third row now being very usable even by small-made adults. The other seats are also better cushioned and bolstered, with the second row 60:40 seats also offering a 15-degree recline and fore and aft adjustments.






Safety standard: The new Ertiga gets a bunch of safety equipment as standard and the AT variants even get ESP and Hill Hold    -  S Muralidhar  
 
Safety standard: The new Ertiga gets a bunch of safety equipment as standard and the AT variants even get ESP and Hill Hold    -  S Muralidhar 
The cabin sports a dual tone theme with a mushroom grey and beige colour combination. There is an air of Suzuki about it, but that is still now a big plus. The cabin may not be luxurious, but it is still plush. The faux maple wood inserts, for example, are fake alright, but not obviously so. The leather-wrapped, flat bottomed steering wheel with wood insert is a bit much in an MPV, but it is so well finished and integrated that it fits. There are a number of small storage spaces in addition to the usual bottle holders and door pockets; of note is the duo of cooled cup holders in the centre console. The dashboard layout itself sports a simple, layered orientation with a very sedan-like position of controls and the 17.8-cm touchscreen infotainment system (in the top ZD+ trim). The instrument cluster is also an LCD multi-information screen that displays key info in a format very similar to other Nexa models like the S-Cross and Ciaz.
Before getting to the powertrains, a mention about Maruti Suzuki’s smart hybrid technology with the lithium-ion battery that has been carried forward into the Ertiga too after the Ciaz. The 2.5 kW electric motor, of what is effectively a mild hybrid, draws power from the dedicated battery to offer parallel assistance during acceleration. The system functions include brake energy regeneration, an idle start-stop function and torque assist to reduce load on the engine during different acceleration cycles.






The rear of the car gets a refreshed look  
 
The rear of the car gets a refreshed look 
The powertrain choices include the 1.5-litre K15 petrol engine in the same state of tune as in the Ciaz. The 1,462 cc engine produces 77 kW of peak power and 138 Nm of peak torque. It is offered with the option of a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic (we have seen both these gearboxes in other Maruti cars). The four-Speed auto is a torque converter transmission, which has probably been picked up from the Japanese parent’s portfolio and it includes a low ‘L’ gear slot and a ‘2’ in second gear slot for high load conditions. The manual gearbox is a crisp, clean-shifting transmission that has a different set of ratios compared to the Ciaz, with taller lower gears. The engine itself is a good fit given the attempt at raising the bar for the Ertiga. It is refined, and even though it is not really a rev-happy unit, delivers a fairly healthy performance mid-range, which should suit most user profiles.
The other engine option is the tried and trusted DDiS 200 diesel engine. What is essentially the Fiat MultiJet engine, this 1,248 cc unit is still surprisingly sprightly for a vehicle that is as heavy as the Ertiga. Thankfully, the new generation despite its larger size is not heavier than the outgoing model and so the carried-over engine still feels torquey and quick off the block. The oil burner develops a peak power of 66 kW and a peak torque of 200 Nm starting from a low 1,750 rpm. This engine only gets the five-speed manual transmission, which seems adequate except when one is cruising at three-digit speeds and that makes you wonder if it should have had a sixth slot. It also gets the Smart Hybrid system.
The Ertiga’s ride quality was not much of a problem even for the previous generation, but the new one’s ride is even better. Very much like the new Swift, Baleno and the Ciaz, there is a feeling of sure-footedness and confidence about the suspension set-up that is heartening. It doesn’t trash about on bad roads and body roll is also quite well contained.
On the whole, the new Ertiga is a much better package than the outgoing model. It feels more plush and is also more practical with a few unique bits like the trays in the boot that hide a lower section and the cooled cupholders. Maruti’s variants strategy always seems to cut the ATs a bit short on features; that continues in the Ertiga. But there is still a good range of trim levels to choose from. Prices range from ₹7.44 lakh to ₹10.9 lakh."

“The biggest problem in India is the large number of small cars. Around 70 per cent of these cars could not be parked at homes and thus cannot be charged. I don’t think that small car electrification can happen on the basis of subsidies. We need technology for that,” Bhargava told reporters here.
The chairman of the country’s largest car maker was commenting on a report of a proposal to impose cess of Rs 500-Rs 25,000 on conventional vehicles to promote clean energy vehicles in the country.
Bhargava said all around the globe, including the US and Europe, electrification of cars has met with little success so far.
He said if a cess has to be there then two-wheelers also need to be taxed.
“If the principle is that a polluter pays then two-wheelers are also polluters. Why not a cess on two-wheelers also, so that the cess of petrol two-wheelers is utilised to subsidise electric two-wheelers,” Bhargava said.
Two-thirds of petrol in the country is consumed by two-wheelers, and electrification of two-wheelers becomes, so far, more practical in terms of infrastructure than electrification of cars, he added.
Bhargava stated that with 85-87 per cent car parc in India between now and 2030 set to be non electric cars, it is important to look at the problem in a holistic manner.
Parc refers to the total number of registered vehicles plying in the country.
“By then (2030), if you like to reduce oil import and pollution, what are your options? Your options are CNG, hybrid and biofuels. All these three technologies are required,” Bhargava said.
He said the better way to achieve target of having a lower fuel import bill and reduction in air pollution is by supporting CNG vehicles.
“If at all there is a cess on internal combustion vehicles, why not use this fund to build CNG infrastructure? It will happen quickly and give results quickly as well even with infrastructure shortage, sales of CNG cars have been going up,” Bhargava noted.
Bhargava also sought a lower goods and services tax for a hybrid vehicle which is an eco-friendly technology.
“EV is not the only technology. It is a means to an end and not an end in itself,” he said urging policy-makers to consider other technologies as well.
Commenting on the company’s plans, he said Maruti Suzuki India is looking to introduce a strong hybrid technology in its petrol cars that would help increase fuel efficiency by as much as 30 per cent.
The company would get the technology as part of the Toyota-Suzuki collaboration.
“By April 2020, when BS-VI emission norm is implemented, the cost of a diesel vehicle is expected to be around Rs 2.5 lakh more expensive than a petrol variant. Customers will then decide whether to go for diesel or petrol...our production will have to be naturally adjusted with customer demand,” he said."

 Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) is seeking a land parcel of around 700 acres in Haryana for shifting its Gurgaon plant, a top company official said.
The company considers Haryana as its “mother State” and will scout for another location in the State only, considering the presence of its supplier base.
“Already, Manesar plant is spread across 700 acres so we are looking at a similar kind of land (for shifting Gurgaon plant),” MSI Managing Director and CEO Kenichi Ayukawa told PTI.
The company has not set any time line for shifting the plant and the focus right now is to locate a good land parcel, he added.
When asked if the company is looking to establish the new plant in Haryana itself, Ayukawa said: “First we have to discuss with the Haryana government ...because Haryana is our mother State... we have to focus in that area ... besides, we also have a lot of suppliers here ... we have to manage that also.” 
He added that so far the company has received a positive response from the Haryana government over the issue.
When asked to comment on the planned investment in the new plant, Ayukawa said it will depend on the production capacity which is yet to be decided.
MSI has been looking to shift its plant from Gurgaon due to congestion and traffic hassles. With the rapid development in Gurgaon, the company now finds its plant in the middle of a bustling city which has made it difficult for trucks carrying raw materials and finished products move in and out of the plant.
Besides Gurgaon, MSI has another manufacturing unit in Haryana at Manesar. Both Gurgaon and Manesar plants have a production capacity of 15.5 lakh units per annum.
Its parent Suzuki Motor Corp has also set up a facility in Gujarat. The first line with a capacity of 2.5 lakh units is in full production and the second one will be commissioned early next year.
Work has also started on the third line and the expected commissioning is early 2020. MSI is targeting annual production of 3 million units by 2025."

57,2018-12-27,Maruti,"Suzuki Swift bags ICOTY 2019. Premium Car Award goes to Volvo XC40
This year hasn’t seen the best performance for the automobile industry. Passenger car sales have dragged on, barely hitting two-digit growth percentages for many months. But, that hasn’t dampened the enthusiasm of the industry, which has continued its march forward with new launches, though at a slightly slower pace. Some of the most interesting new cars and sports utility vehicles (SUVs) made their way to the market in 2018. Many of them represent a significant step up in the maturity of the companies and brands.
This Indian Car of the Year (ICOTY) award has always been a good barometer of the domestic car industry and the shortlist for the 2019 award was no different. Yes, there were fewer cars competing for the ICOTY this year. But product plans are often finalised years in advance and so, they aren’t connected to the current state of the market. There were only eight contenders in the list this year and all of them made it to the final shortlist, versus 13 contenders and nine in the ICOTY shortlist for last year. Some cars that have been launched after the cut-off date of November 30 haven’t made to this year’s ICOTY shortlist. So, while the Tata Nexon made it to last year’s list, the Harrier, which is yet to be commercially launched, wasn’t part of ICOTY 2019. Similarly, Nissan Kicks too will only be included in the list for ICOTY 2020.
Cars and SUVs that have either been manufactured locally or assembled from completely knocked down kits in an Indian facility, and have been commercially launched in the market here before November of that year qualify for the award and will be considered for the contenders list. ICOTY rules as per the constitution also imply that vehicles cannot be minor model modifications or mid-cycle face-lifts for existing models. If a previous generation of the model is already in the market, then the new one has to be extensively reworked, re-engineered and with new powertrains. The vehicles are then selected to form an initial list from which a final shortlist is chosen based on a range of parameters. Both the lists for ICOTY 2019 remained the same eight contenders.
The cars and SUVs that were part of ICOTY 2019’s shortlist included the Honda CR-V and Amaze, the Maruti Suzuki Swift and Ertiga, the Mahindra Marazzo and Alturas G4, new Hyundai Santro, and the Toyota Yaris. On one of the rare occasions, three manufacturers had two vehicles each in the shortlist, with the Alturas G4 and the Ertiga making it to market just in the nick of time. The short-listed cars are voted for and judged based on multiple parameters such as price, fuel efficiency, design, comfort, safety, features, performance, practicality, value-for-money proposition, innovation and technology, and suitability based on Indian consumers’ preferences and driving conditions.
The big change during this year’s ICOTY jury round was the move to a new venue, which turned out to be the Buddh International Circuit in Greater Noida near Delhi. Being a Formula 1 circuit is one aspect of the venue, but none of the cars were evaluated on the track for voting purposes. It provided the right atmosphere for conducting the voting process; and it also provided an opportunity for some of the latest luxury cars to be taken out and experienced in the most ideal conditions we could have ever asked for.
After the voting and counting process was completed, the Suzuki Swift was adjudged the winner of the ICOTY 2019 with a total of 125 points. The runner-up was the Hyundai Santro with a tally of 96 points. And the second runner-up was the Honda Amaze with 77 points. This was a significant win for the Swift, with a large point differential compared to the nearest competitor in the final tally. All three generations of the Swift have won the ICOTY award. The Maruti Suzuki hatch has sold more than two million units since its launch in May 2005.
In addition to yours truly on behalf of the BusinessLine, the other members in the ICOTY jury included Yogendra Pratap and Rahul Ghosh on behalf of Auto Today, Dhruv Behl and Ishan Raghava from AutoX, Aspi Bhathena and Sarmad Kadiri from Car India, Sirish Chandran and Aninda Sardar from Evo India, Karthik Ware and Raunak Ajinkya from Motoring World, Rohit Paradkar and Abhay Varma from Overdrive, Girish Karkera and Agasti Kaulgi from TopGear India, Pablo Chaterji from Man’s World, Vikrant Singh and Hani Musthafa. In all, nine different publications and media brands are represented in the ICOTY 2019 jury.
The ICOTY 2019 award and certificate were presented to representatives from Maruti Suzuki India by Dr Raghupati Singhania, Chairman and Managing Director, JK Tyre and Industries at a glittering ceremony in Mumbai last week. JK Tyre has been the official sponsor for the award ceremony right from the inception of the ICOTY in 2006."

 South India could get the next plant of the country’s largest passenger car maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) as it works on its expansion plan.
“If we have to expand further beyond our existing capacity — Gujarat and Haryana (both put together) — then South is a logical region to put up a plant. I can’t see where a third site would be other than in the South. That will be nearer to the market and good for exports too,” RC Bhargava, Chairman, MSIL, told BusinessLine in an interview. 
The southern part of India is becoming a new hub for the auto makers to set up facilities as the States offer rebates on taxes and there is also the proximity to ports. For instance, Andhra Pradesh has welcomed many players in the recent past such as Kia Motors — setting up its first facility — and Hero MotoCorp — building its eighth facility — in the State. Similarly, Tamil Nadu has many success stories such as Hyundai Motor India, Nissan and BMW. 
Suzuki Gujarat, which has a capacity of 2.5 lakh units per year right now, will be expanded to 7.50 lakh units per annum by 2020, and the company has a target to sell around 20 lakh passenger vehicles in a year by 2020 from all facilities put together. 
Right now, the Haryana plants (Manesar and Gurugram) have a capacity of 15.5 lakh unit per annum put together. Gradually, the company aims to make 30-lakh vehicles by 2030.
About the timeline, he said, “We will decide to put up a third site when the Gujarat site is about to be fully utilised. That is not unreasonable at all to think of…it is just that timing is another issue.” 
With the congestion increasing at Gurugram by the day, there has been a lot of pressure on MSIL to shift its facility from there and the company has started looking at various options, including within Haryana only so that employees working at the plant are not affected, Bhargava added. 
MSIL makes most of its top models, including the Swift and the Wagon R, at the Haryana facilities. 
The company sold around 13.08 lakh vehicles between April and December, up 7.4 per cent compared with 12.20 lakh units in April-December 2017. It had a market share of 52 per cent between April and November 2018."

RC Bhargava, Chairman, Maruti Suzuki India


 The country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) will launch two new models next fiscal, a top company official said.
The auto major, which has introduced two models in the current fiscal so far, is also in the process of upgrading its current portfolio to have safety features like airbags, seat belt reminder and reverse parking sensors by June to comply with new safety norms. 
 “(There are) two new product launches in 2019-20,” MSI Chairman RC Bhargava told PTI.
He further said one product would be launched in the fourth quarter of 2018-19.
It is understood that the product will be launched later this month and is the new version of the company’s popular compact car WagonR. 
MSI has already launched new versions of its multi-purpose vehicle Ertiga and sedan Ciaz in 2018-19. It had also introduced new Swift in February last year.
According to industry sources, while one of the brand new models could be retailed through the company’s premium chain Nexa, the other could be introduced in the mass market Arena outlets.
Sales outlook
When asked about sales outlook, Bhargava said the company is “pretty optimistic” about sales in 2019 partly because of new model launches.
“Besides, historically it has been seen that election year is always a high sales year... so after looking at all these things we are pretty optimistic that next year is going to be a good year,” Bhargava said.
New safety norms
Commenting on preparations for upgrading vehicles to conform to the new safety norms, MSI Senior Executive Director (Engineering) CV Raman said all its models will have to conform with safety features like airbags, seat belt safety reminder and reverse parking sensors by June this year.
“Today, we have seven models that are already compliant and rest three we are working on,” he said.
The company started safety upgradation process for its models with Vitara Brezza in 2016. 
As per the government regulations, all passenger vehicle manufacturers are required to have airbags, seat belt reminder and reverse parking sensors in all their models from July 1, 2019.
Besides, models which have been in the market will have to be equipped with anti-lock braking system (ABS) with effect from April 2019. On the other hand, all new models were mandated to have ABS from April 2018.
Other upgraded safety regulations like frontal, offset and side impact in existing models are scheduled to come into effect from October 1, 2019. New models are already compliant from October last year.
Pedestrian safety regulations for passenger vehicles will kick in from October 2020."

52,2019-01-10,Maruti,"‘Way things are shaping up, diesel is not for the long term’


RC Bhargava, Chairman, Maruti Suzuki India




RC Bhargava, Chairman, Maruti Suzuki India




Maruti Suzuki India, which has the most alternative fuel options — petrol, diesel, hybrid and CNG — among the universe of passenger car makers, says diesel will not be an option in the long term. As the BS-VI emission norms kick in, the price of a hybrid vehicle and the one that runs on diesel will be much similar, while the petrol hybrid will score on fuel-efficiency and will be environment-friendly. RC Bhargava, Chairman, Maruti Suzuki India, in an exclusive interview with BusinessLine, also said the government norm that restricts the royalty payment to two per cent and insists on the nod of minority shareholders every year will also translate into a huge compliance cost for the company. Edited excerpts.
How has the transition been towards BS-VI ?
BS-VI was in the works. So, it had to come. There was no reason why a market as big as India should not have safety and environmental technology, which is already available. But, keep in mind CNG is the biggest source of reduction in pollution today. CNG vehicles are already in use: they have customer acceptance and technology is not an issue...but nobody talks about CNG. Only now, some things have started around CNG, such as the government announcing plans for 10,000 outlets (dispensing CNG) by 2030. So, I think they are finally accepting that CNG has to be promoted, and they have to become conscious about the value of CNG for transportation.
What is the future of diesel vehicles, especially for Maruti since you have so many alternative fuel options?
Diesel is not a fuel for the long-term forpassenger vehicles. The reason is, with BS-VI, the cost of a diesel car will become the same as a petrol car with a hybrid system. Today, a diesel car is ₹1.10 lakh or a bit more expensive than a petrol car (of similar variant). But, with BS-VI, the difference will become almost ₹2.5 lakh when compared with purchase of a petrol car. 
Hybrid petrol will not go more than ₹2.5 lakh, so it will be similar. Diesel gives around 25 per cent higher fuel efficiency than petrol, but with hybrid, it gives around 30 per cent higher. So, actually a petrol car will be marginally fuel efficient than a diesel car. Environmentally also, it will be better than a diesel car. 
So, to me at this stage, diesel, as a fuel, is going to die out in the long term. 
What is the update on Suzuki-Toyota collaboration? Who will make the electric vehicle from that collaboration?
Toyota has hybrid technology and that technology becomes available to Suzuki, which in turn will be made available to India. EV, at the moment, is being done by Suzuki . They have made some cars which we are testing on roads here. But, how many customers would buy that is the big question, because ultimately somebody has to buy it. The bigger cars will probably have Toyota technology. But again, volume is the problem. The question for EVs is also where is the availability of electricity? Where is the distribution system, because loads will become much heavier. Each car requires 2-3 kilowatt load with three-phase power. Where are you going to improve? The problem is cost and infrastructure. 
The Toyota-Suzuki collaboration also will sell cars at each other’s outlets? Would the latest Toyota Camry hybrid be sold through Maruti’s outlets? Are the timings decided?
I don’t know what the date is. We will be providing cars to Toyota – Baleno to start with; it will be badged as a Toyota car with some changes and sold through Toyota dealerships. For Corolla — that will be a little later – not so soon. 
There are talks of shifting the Gurugram plant. Have you been offered any land by the Haryana government?
We have said that we have to shift, because the plant is now in the middle of congested habitation. People built homes all over the place, and they complained saying ‘your trucks and movement of materials with vehicles create huge disturbance’. And, Gurugram has now put all kinds of restrictions with vehicles moving out and in. So what are our options other than shifting the plant…things can’t be improved, so we have to shift. And, while shifting, I have to look at what happens to my workers. We have some 20,000-22,000 workers of all types. What do I do with them? If I take the plant 200 km away, what happens to the employee? He can’t move that far. That is why we are looking for a site where it will be possible for the workers to also come…may be within 30-40 km, which will still be possible. I have my vendors in that area, and again, if I move far, it is not suitable to them. We were offered a land at Sohna, but there was a soil problem. The water table is very low there and high on salt content, so we had to give up. Otherwise, distance-wise, it was the best. 
Do you see any impact of the new SEBI norms where they talk about two per cent royalty payment with a nod from minority shareholders too?
We have been stressing that it is not appropriate at all. The problem really is that you have two groups of technology companies. One group is FMCG, food processing and such things, where the R&D, sales and technology cost is very small . How much research can happen in food processing or FMCG or such things? Then you have the other companies...automotive, pharma, IT...where the R&D expenditure is much higher. You need to change models every few years, adopt new technology for safety and emission...right now electric is happening…so its much higher. We did a study, and found globally, the standard of these technology industries is five per cent. So two per cent is not possible anywhere in a number of industries. My suggestion to the government is – have two groups of royalty – one for those industries where you think the requirements of technology and R&D are within two per cent. And, one where we need to have higher technology. Why one size fits all? Not unreasonable. But, let’s see what they decide. 
But, what if the government doesn’t agree?
Then we have to take it…we don’t have any option. It will be a waste of lot of time and money, because our shareholders are all over the world. So, we need to take a trip to meet all the shareholders and tell them what’s happening to take their nod. And, this has to happen every year and it will mean a huge compliance cost. 
The current Managing Director Kenichi Ayukawa’s tenure is ending in March. Who will be the next MD and why not an Indian after Jagdish Khattar yet?
That is not in my hands. Japan decides. The problem is, India is a subsidiary office, and Suzuki has to incorporate the results in their sheets. They have to inform their shareholders from time to time. It requires a system where they can get fully on what’s happening in India. A Japanese official makes it much easier in communication and understanding, unless we have an Indian guy who can communicate all the time in Japanese because language is an issue. That is one reason. And, confidence also matters – how do I make sure that my company is running okay? For Suzuki’s shareholders in Japan, the Indian operation is more important than the Japanese operation, in terms of their survival. For marketing and sales, there is an Indian who does everything, but Suzuki has to keep the Japanese shareholders happy. So, I don’t think we will get an Indian MD. And, there is one thing that Ayukawa has done — he has adjusted to Indian conditions very well. That is why he stayed on for so long (he got an extension last year). I don’t think Suzuki will ever find somebody like him."

New third-gen WagonR 2019 
The all-new WagonR is engineered and built on fifth generation Heartect platform and comes with ABS with EBD, driver airbag, seat-belt reminder with buzzer, speed alert system and rear parking sensors as standard in all the trims.
The Heartect platform increases safety of occupants through effective absorption of impact and dispersion of crash energy and assures stability. Use of 40 per cent high tensile steel provides better strength, safety, rigidity and noise, vibration, and harshness performance, the company said.
In addition to 1-litre engine, the new WagonR also comes with a stronger 1.2-litre engine to deliver powerful performance. It offers fuel efficiency for both the engine options: 21.5 km/l for 1.2 L variant and 22.5 km/l for 1.0 L variant, which is nearly 10 per cent higher than the outgoing model, it said.
“Over the years WagonR has become the choice of more than 2.2 million families. We are confident that the new WagonR with its all new robust design, dynamically crafted and spacious interiors, will become the choice of many more Indian families,"" Kenichi Ayukawa, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, MSIL, said.
The company and its partners have invested around ₹670 crore for development of new WagonR, he said adding that the company expects the all-new WagonR to become a preferred choice just not for families but also for young buyers."
48,2019-01-24,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki to set up JIM in Haryana 
 Maruti Suzuki India on Thursday signed a pact with the Haryana government for setting up a Japan-India Institute for Manufacturing (JIM) to train over 500 youth annually. The company will make an initial investment of Rs 7 crore to establish the model industrial training institute (ITI) at Uncha Majra village in Gurugram district, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) said in a statement.
 “While the state government has provided land and building, Maruti Suzuki will offer latest equipment and tools, employ industry experts as trainers and ensure students are trained in quality, safety, discipline, kaizen and other Japanese practices so that they are employable and have a sound long-term career,” MSI Executive Director (Corporate Planning) A K Tomer said.
 JIM Uncha Majra, which will be the first in Haryana, is expected to start its first session by August 2019. “Nearly 500 youth will be trained at this state-of-the-art model ITI,” the company added. The institute will be located near the automobile hub of Manesar, Gurugram, Faridabad and Bhiwadi and will provide the youth with the skills to benefit from this economic opportunity.
 JIM is born out of a collaboration between Japanese and Indian governments to create a pool of skilled manpower for manufacturing in India. The first-ever JIM by Maruti Suzuki was set up at Mehsana, Gujarat, in 2017."
47,2019-01-25,Maruti,"High costs, weak festival sales hit Maruti Suzuki’s Q3 numbers
Several factors, including high commodity prices and weak sales during the festival season, drove down Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s (MSIL) third-quarter net profit to ₹1,489 crore. This marks a 17 per cent decline year-on-year (YoY) from the ₹1,799-crore profit seen in the corresponding period last fiscal year.
However, MSIL’s total revenue from operations rose 2 per cent YoY to ₹19,668 crore in the October-December quarter (₹19,283 crore).
“While the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) had forecast a passenger vehicle domestic market growth of 8-10 per cent for the year, the industry could grow only 4.4 per cent in the first three quarters,” MSIL said in a statement.
The Q3 results have to be viewed in the context of particularly weak market conditions, it added.
As of December 31, 2018, the company had sold 1,89,264 units, against 1,89,400 as of December 31, 2017.
The latest quarter also witnessed adverse commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, higher marketing and sales expenditure and higher resource costs.
These impacted profitability and capacities that were originally expected to boost growth, the company said.
Passenger vehicle exports declined 8.5 per cent owing to weakness in global markets, trade barriers in some markets, and the devaluation of most currencies against the US dollar, MSIL said.
On Friday, MSIL shares closed 7.5 per cent down at ₹6,513.40 on the NSE."
46,2019-01-27,Maruti,"India is an economic powerhouse in the making
Twenty-five years ago I was hugely optimistic that with the control and licence raj ending, India would move to an economy largely regulated by market forces. I was hopeful that competitive forces would start to operate in all sectors and that would result in products and services improving to reach global standards. Some areas of business did benefit from liberalisation and competition. Mobile telephony would never have spread to all corners of India, with costs becoming the lowest in the world, without the lifting of controls and opening up to competition. The disappointment over these years has been the failure to extend the full benefits of liberalisation to all sectors of manufacturing and services. Agriculture remained a highly controlled and regulated sector and the rural-urban income disparities only increased. The mindset of policymakers only partially changed from the full control mentality of the past.
The automobile sector immensely benefited from competition. Licensing was abolished in 1993, and in a few years most global manufacturers headed to India. This was to a large extent because the unexpectedly large success of Maruti convinced the world of the potential of India. The production and sale of cars has continued to grow, from less than 200,000 vehicles then to nearly 4 million cars now, making India the world’s fourth-largest car producer. The quality, design and performance of cars is world-class. The sale of cars generates huge downstream employment. India exports about 750,000 cars a year and the auto component industry not only has a turnover of over $51 billion, but earned $ 13 billion by exporting components in 2017-18. Can the benefits of free competition be doubted?
In this period, Maruti Udyog itself underwent a huge transformation. From a Public Sector Undertaking, it became a 50-50 joint venture between the government and Suzuki Japan in 1992. After a few years, the government wisely decided to let Suzuki Japan manage the company and gradually diluted its holding to zero in 2007. Maruti became Maruti Suzuki India Limited, was listed, and is among the top ten companies in the country, with a market capitalisation substantially larger than its parent in Japan. I wonder what Maruti would be like today if the government had decided to continue it as a public sector enterprise.
There are several other success stories in the past 25 years. Despite these successes, overall industrial growth has not accelerated, and manufacturing has remained between 15-16 per cent of GDP. India over the years became a country where it was very difficult to do business or establish a competitive manufacturing industry. Tax evasion, black money and corruption continued to grow and flourish and was accepted by most as a permanent part of life. Team working and partnership between politicians, bureaucracy and industry failed to develop and resulted in economic growth being below our potential.
It was only from 2014 that the process of change in this area started. India’s Ease of Doing Business ranking has improved by 65 positions in these four years, but even now new investments in manufacturing are slow. Several measures taken by the government, including introduction of the GST and direct transfer of benefits to the poorer sections of society have resulted in better tax compliance and reduction in black money. Digitisation is spreading and reducing the ability of the bureaucracy to hold citizens at ransom. The pessimism that had crept in due to stalled liberalisation is slowly giving way to optimism.
The past 25 years have seen the social change that the internet and the smartphone is bringing to the country. In 1993, there were no mobile phones. Now hardly anyone, and especially the young, can be seen without it. The ability to access information about any subject from anywhere in the world is rapidly changing the thinking and behaviour of the youth. They are becoming much more independent of the beliefs and thinking of earlier generations. Their aspirations are very different, and they want jobs and the means to meet these aspirations.
The reduction in the voting age to 18 has led to the voting power of the youth increasing in every election. They no longer vote as their parents did and caste and religion are not as important as development and jobs. It is exciting to think that in the next quarter century, politics in India will become development-oriented, productivity and competitiveness will rise sharply and India will become an economic powerhouse.

43,2019-01-31,Maruti,"New Maruti Suzuki WagonR test drive review
The WagonR was the original tall-boy, though Maruti didn’t get to leverage its primacy. But, it has made up for the lost opportunities of the initial years and has sold over 22 lakh units during the 19 years of its existence. It is today a key part of Maruti’s portfolio with one out of every four customers staying loyal and replacing their older WagonR with a new one. 
But, the problem has been that this Maruti hatch hasn’t changed that much over the years. Though the WagonR has seen two generations, it seems more like there have only been a few facelifts and limited editions. It’s over-boxy design has been the brand trademark, but clearly the design was looking tired and dated. So, the new third generation WagonR is a welcome change with its rounded edges and more contemporary profile, though it still manages to retain the original’s tall-boy advantages. 
The new 2019 WagonR has been built on the 5th generation Heartect platform, which is inherently lighter, more rigid and capable of meeting the new safety regulations. The older generation’s compact, narrow footprint is history. And though the new one seems compact when viewed straight-on from the front and the rear, the side profile showcases the increase in length and wheelbase. The new Gen WagonR’s extra length at the rear significantly increases cabin room and luggage space in the boot.
It’s wheelbase is up 35mm and the front and rear tracks are 140mm and 150mm wider respectively. The car now clearly looks bigger and more squat, though the high-set roof line reminds you of its roots. The increase in dimensions outside has led to an increase in space in the cabin too. Front row space is said to be up 20mm and the tandem distance at the rear has also gone up marginally by 10mm. The big jump in space is in the boot, where a 170mm increase in depth has allowed storage space to jump to 341litres (more than even the Vitara Brezza). Despite the increase in dimensions, the overall weight of the new WagonR has dropped by about 65kgs thanks to the lighter Heartect platform and its higher use of high-strength steel.
The WagonR’s design has always been focused on practicality, with an over-emphasis on square, boxy styling and rather straight lines. While the tall-boy character hasn’t lost its charm, design sensibilities amongst buyers have matured. So, the rounded edges and the more aggressive modern face of the new WagonR will be appreciated, as will be the retention of its tall-boy character. The larger, dual-split headlamps look square when viewed from the front, but from the front three-quarter angle it a mix of peeled-back edges and a unique kink on the side where the body panel cuts in. Though it borders on excess, it still works in giving the new WagonR a unique front design. The new broader front fender and the new bonnet grille also contribute to a completely fresh front design. 
The nose of the WagonR is now curved forward, in line with the design and for pedestrian safety norms. It also gets wheel arches, which are more like carved out creases on the body panel. The door mirrors are short stalked and look similar in design to the ones in Maruti’s NEXA models. The roof is a flat panel, though it’s edges are now curved and prominently so where it meets the A-pillar and the C-pillar. The A-pillar itself is quite thin and helps improve visibility when one is behind the wheel. Door handles seem like they are a carry forward from the previous generation WagonR. The C-pillar panel is thicker in the new WagonR due to the increased length. The blacked out window graphic extends into the C-pillar and joins the top of the tail-lamps giving the WagonR a slightly vague floating roof concept. 
The rear design is more cohesive and appropriate for the tall hatchback theme. Vertical tail-lamps that hint of being inspired by Volvo’s estates, a rather straight slab of a tailgate (reminds you of the previous WagonR) and some chunky chrome garnish gives the rear design some strength. Even the top trim doesn’t get alloy wheels as standard in the new WagonR; they are optional additions. The black steel rims and plastic hub caps manage to bring some elegance to the equation. But the rim options are 13-inchers in the 1.0L engine variants and 14-inchers in the K-Series 1.2 engine variants. Upsizing to 15-inchers and appropriate tyres should be possible without affecting the ride.
The new WagonR’s cabin is roomier than the outgoing model. There is nearly 12cms of extra space thanks to the increased track and curved exterior design of the lower half. There is also more legroom in the new model, both at the front and the rear. The dashboard continues to be a fairly vertical layout and the instrument panel design has been given a X-shaped orientation. The layout is still pretty simplistic and straightforward with the most significant addition being the new 17.8cm floating ‘SmartPlay’ infotainment’s touchscreen. Offering Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and proprietary app-based connectivity, this system offers all the usual features and in addition can display vehicle information and cloud-based services. 
The cabin has a pleasing combination of theme colours that runs across the panels and seat fabric. The material quality has also improved, though it is hard to ignore the feeling of being surrounded by acres of plastic. The seats are comfortable though the squabs are relatively thin. There is no height adjustment available even for the driver’s seat, though steering tilt adjustment helps get a good driving position. The rear seats in the new WagonR offer more legroom than the previous model; headroom continues to be generous and will be more than enough even for passengers who are over six feet tall. 
The third generation WagonR is being offered with two petrol engine options and two transmission options - manual and auto gear shift (AGS). One of the engine options is the same one-litre, 3-cylinder petrol from the outgoing model and in the same state of tune. So, it produces 50kW of power and 90Nm of torque. This engine and its MT and AGS variants weren’t available for testing during the national media drive held in Udaipur earlier this week. The ones at hand were the MT and AGS versions of the 1.2-litre K12 engine. 
This peppy petrol mill delivers 61kW of power and 113Nm of torque (same as in the Swift and the Ignis). Unlike the rough 1.0L 3-cylinder, the K12 engine is refined, and revs freely. Featuring vibration reducing pendulum engine mounts and much improved NVH packaging helps keep the the new WagonR’s cabin quieter and completely vibe-free. The manual transmission paired with the K12 has well spaced ratios that enables the WagonR to be driven with ease at slow speeds and sportily within gears. The clutch is progressive and transmission’ shift quality is also very good. 
The AGS gearbox has been fine tuned with every new vehicle that Maruti has added to its stable. The WagonR’s AGS is still a shade below the competition in terms of its response, though in terms of shift quality and refinement it is on par. The generic shift shocks associated with AMTs has been pretty much ironed out; and it also responds with kick downs for hard acceleration quicker than in some of the earlier AGS variants. Creep function (slow speed) is good and manual gear selection is also offered. Claimed mileage numbers are 22.5kmpl for the 1.0L (10 per cent more than in outgoing model) and 21.5kmpl for the 1.2L variants.
The ride quality in the new WagonR is also a step up. It is not as confident and planted as the Baleno, but, for a tall-boy, the ride still feels settled and unruffled even over broken tarmac. Though, at higher speeds you do feel body roll and sway associated with tall-boys. Standard safety features include driver airbag, ABS with EBD, and mandatory ones such as speed warning and rear parking sensors. A front passenger airbag is available as an optional addition.
Roomier, peppier, safer and better built - what’s not to like? Thankfully, it is also still a WagonR. Prices start from ₹4.19 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi)."

The statistics are mind boggling. 
These days, prospective car buyers use the internet for their research, typically searching for information on which model would suit their needs most, the best deals available for their budget, and customer reviews.
People tend to research online at every stage of the customer journey. In other words, countless digital micro-moments are now ruling the buying process.
It is in this backdrop that market leader Maruti Suzuki decided to get in on the action. “Affordable smartphones and mobile data plans have brought more and more people into the digital world and changed their content consumption patterns. A huge number of automobile buyers tend to watch online videos before buying a car,” says Tarun Garg, Executive Director, Marketing, Maruti Suzuki.
An annual report by Google and Kantar TNS, which tracks consumers’ car research and purchase journey, underscores this huge shift with consumers. Almost 90 per cent of auto sales in India were digitally influenced in 2018, up from 74 per cent in 2016, according to ‘The Drive to Decide 2018’ report.
The report found that video (at 80 per cent), search (90 per cent) and brand or dealer websites (56 per cent) continue to be the strongest influencers transforming the automotive industry, and are key digital touchpoints that play a crucial role in influencing a car-buyer’s decision.
With online an indispensable research source, and India hosting over 460 million smartphone users, Maruti realised it was time to move metal in a digital world and “to experiment and innovate content and formats designed for digital platforms”. The auto-maker decided to create new ads and content for its digital audience. For its Ertiga, the company created a series of ads titled ‘Real Time Social’ to market the car in a fairly cluttered automobile space.
A story of four friends who decide to go on a road trip away from smartphones, the advertisements highlighted the friends exploring the offline world to discover Real Time Social experiences.
The Ertiga Real Time Social video web series for YouTube, which were short two-three minute videos highlighting the journey of a group of friends, garnered over seven million views. The Ertiga launch also saw the creation of mobile-first ads and creatives and formats.
For its Super Carry, a mini pick-up truck, Dentsu Impact, the creative agency from the Dentsu Aegis Network, created a new campaign to celebrate the pan-India launch of the commercial vehicle. The ‘Dumdaar’ campaign highlighted the features of the mini truck, depicting easy handling and stability of the deck across different geographical terrains, mileage, drivability throughout long commutes and reliability of the vehicle.
A new digital medium was also used. “For Super Carry, we released WhatsApp-only films for Tier 2 and Tier 3 town audiences, based on insight of WhatsApp being a potent engagement platform for commercial segment customers,” says Garg.
For the Vitara Brezza, the company released a new web ad series called ‘Outglammed’ for its sub-four metre SUV. The first ad shows an actress arriving in a Brezza before a group of waiting photographers. What happens next is what puts the arc lights on the SUV. 
Three similar ads followed. The Vitara Brezza Outglammed videos garnered 77 million impressions and 19.3 million views. The automobile brand decided to go one step further with its Maruti Suzuki Arena, a trendy, social and connected car-buying platform.
The Arena dealerships bring intelligent architecture, latest technology, interactive equipment, and a seamless integration of the virtual and real-world, making a blend of technology and digitalisation.
Maruti launched the online video content repositories with Arena World and Nexa World, with over 250-plus online content pieces. Through online video, the company feels, consumers are able to experience parts of the shopping journey that previously could only be done at the dealer, including vehicle walk-arounds, product demonstrations, and video test drives.
Heard of the saying ‘A picture is worth a thousand words?’ Then how much is a three-minute video worth? Three minutes of footage multiplied by 25 frames per second increased by 1,000 equals... a lot. You do the math.
This is when the company decided it was time to jump on the video wagon. “With two billion video views at Maruti Suzuki, we have moved from traditional television commercials in 16:9 aspect ratio to 1:1 square format for users on Facebook and Instagram,” says Garg. 
“Vertical videos that take up the full screen of the mobile have become a way for us. This makes it more convenient for consumers,” he adds. This ‘digital mindset’ has also been incorporated in the company’s marketing communication planning.
Videos are helping the brand advance in the brand discovery and consideration stages, possibly accelerating the lengthy and unpredictable automotive sales cycles. 
The company is also using 3D real-life interactive creatives to drive thumb-stopping action on mobile feeds for its Nexa Blue campaign. Nexa Blue is a signature shade that has been created exclusively for Nexa-retailed cars.
Fuelled by innovations in technology and media, the automobile industry is experiencing another period of disruption — this time from a smaller screen. Video content is taking over the web. Data shows this year, video content will account for 80 per cent of global internet traffic. More than 64 per cent of consumers buy a product after they watch a video. One billion hours are spent on YouTube daily. These are the headlines: Do you see a trend? 
Maruti did. As did the Google and Kantar TNS study, which showed online video playing a significant role in the purchase journey of an automobile buyer.
Over the last two years, the percentage of online video usage by consumers has nearly doubled from 43 per cent in 2016 to 80 per cent in 2018. The study highlights that videos not only act as a platform for discovery but also as ‘buyers consulting zone’ that allows them to explore the car from different perspectives and get actionable insights. 
The study also showed that 87 per cent of those who watched online videos either visited the dealership (52 per cent), scheduled a test drive (45 per cent), requested a price quote (40 per cent) or further researched finance and lease offers (27 per cent).
Elaborating on the report, Vikas Agnihotri, Country Director-Sales, Google India, says that from searching for manufacturers and dealers online, buyers today are “actively looking for videos to answer their questions around car features to reviews to vehicle performance and more. Consequently, the focus for auto manufacturers has also moved to creating more immersive experiences that allow them to drive this action”."

Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) Monday said it has started the practice of controlling its use of substances of concern (SoC) like lead and mercury in its mass production vehicles.
With the implementation of International Material Data System (IMDS), the company will be able to meet international norms and quantify recoverable and recyclable materials in its vehicles, MSI said in a statement.
 recoverable and 85 per cent recyclable, MSI said.
“We are taking a pro-active step and voluntarily putting in place global mechanism for controlling hazardous substances in our vehicles,” MSI Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Kenichi Ayukawa said.
With the implementation of globally accepted IMDS system, the company will be ready to comply with end-of-life vehicles (ELV) regulations when they are launched in India, he added.
Using IMDS, data related to materials used for automobile manufacturing are collected, maintained, analysed and archived.
It facilitates meeting the ELV obligations placed on automobile manufacturers by national and international standards, laws and regulations.
An ELV-compliant vehicle aims at limiting the use of SoC such as lead, hexavalent chromium, mercury and cadmium, among others, in vehicles. It also promotes recycling and recovery of materials used to manufacture a vehicle.
The auto major said it is also closely working and supporting its vendor partners to establish an efficient SoC management system as well."

“The benchmark success of Vitara Brezza with over four lakh customers in less than three years is a testimony of the customers’ increasing preference towards the refreshed design and innovative features of the compact SUV,” Maruti Suzuki India Senior Executive Director (Marketing and Sales) R S Kalsi said in a statement.
The Vitara Brezza was launched in March 2016. Out of the total sales of the model so far, MSI said the automatic gear shift (AGS) variant has accounted for 20 per cent after its introduction in May 2018.
As on date, the Vitara Brezza commands 44.1 per cent market share in the compact SUV segment, MSI claimed.
The segment stood at around 3 lakh units in April-January period of the ongoing fiscal."
38,2019-02-27,Maruti,"Driving the 3 Es at Maruti Suzuki
Rajesh Uppal has an advantage over most other CHROs. This senior executive director not only leads HR at Maruti Suzuki but also drives the IT function. In his over 32-year career at the auto major, he has spearheaded many initiatives, including digital transformation, learning & development and CSR. He also drives the Maruti Suzuki Training Academy that is tasked with building competent people across the value chain. Excerpts from an interaction:
Maruti has seen many shifts — from public sector to private, from Indian control to Japanese. How has the culture evolved with these shifts?
Maruti was unlike a PSU even when we started off way back. The top management had initially itself introduced a strong culture, which was a mix of Japanese and Indian.
There are four pillars to the culture. We are very strong on process definition (way of working), process adherence (everyone follows this way of work), discipline (nine am means nine am) and trust among people. The culture we introduced when we started has continued till now.
Yes, we have been tweaking a few things as we go along. But the fundamental pillars have remained the same. 
On top of that, we have created space for the innovation teams to work on. If you look at our annual results, the meshing together of the two cultures seems to be working very well.
The challenge for us is to teach this culture to the fresh blood we infuse in the company (300 people are hired every year at the entry level). But we have built strong processes around that.
How is the automation piece going to impact your workforce — given that the auto industry is going to see a lot of that?
Whenever any new technology comes in, the same debate starts of whether people will be replaced. 
But at the end of the day only the job content changes. Different skill sets are needed. Yes, our industry — auto — is changing with new regulations coming in, new fuels coming in. 
So the need for preparing people to adopt new technologies is much higher than earlier.
That’s the area for us to work on and we are putting our people through work environments to understand this change. We send them to our collaborator in Japan to understand new tech. 
Our whole focus is now also on identifying the right talent for these changes.
Do you use HR Tech to scale the speed of talent management?
When I began handling HR too, one of the first projects was to build a robust recruiting process using AI. Because the data available in public domains (LinkedIn, etc) on people is very high. But how do you identify them to match your requirements?
We have managed to use tech to build a new recruiting process. With this we have shrunk the hiring cycle to one-third of the traditional process. But speed is one aspect, quality is another. Technology has enabled us to increase our reach as we can now reach out to passive talent and tap into a larger pool.
Have you outsourced talent management?
No, we have built internal capabilities. Outsourcing is only the efficiency part, and we may look at it later.
In the course of the digital transformation journey, how has the HR function evolved?
The digitisation piece addresses three different dimensions. One is the efficiency piece. Do you respond to employees fast? The second part is the experience part — how are you delivering a better HR experience to your employees and partners and the campuses who engage with us. Third piece is effectiveness. That is where data analytics and AI come in. Digital has been key in driving these three key changes. 
Has the fact that you spearhead IT as well at the company helped with people management?
That has speeded up the process a little bit. But end of the day, people on the ground have to transform and change. Today, the speed is also due to the IP technology available in the cloud. The cloud platforms available make new processes implementable faster. For instance, we could do the recruitment roll-out in three weeks. Traditional way, it would have taken months.
How are employees adopting the digital transformation? Do they have the mindset to embrace change?
I don’t have that challenge here. Adoption is good. For example, we have an employee app, HR Assist, that we developed in-house and launched a few months back. Adoption is over 90 per cent. Everybody is free to get into it, but we find that 90 per cent of our white-collar employees (the company has a 7,000-people-strong workforce) are already on it. It has made life easier for them as there are a lot of self-service options in it. Sales people travelling to dealership, etc, can mark attendance, people can do leave tracking, get their reimbursement claims.
We have done some interesting things on the app. We are a very spread out company, with our people present in 53 locations and so many people have to contact HR for various issues. 
We came out with a tab called Ask HR. You can send any HR query on this, you get a ticket number and the response is sent very quickly. A chatbot is now under development. One of the best things that the app does is it gets people closer. It gets employee engagement going.
Any challenges that you face with millennials entering the workforce? 
Millennials seek flexibility. But frankly, flexibility in manufacturing is a very tricky thing to do because shop floor has to work at one time. 
Gender diversity in manufacturing is also difficult given the supply shortage though we are working consciously on that. We now have 550-odd women employees — but year by year the numbers are growing steadily."

 The country’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) cut production by over 8 per cent in February on account of subdued demand.
The auto major produced a total of 1,48,959 units, including Super Carry LCV, across its factories last month, down 8.3 per cent from 1,62,524 units produced in the year-ago period, the company said in a regulatory filing. 
The production of passenger vehicles, including Alto, Swift, Dzire and Vitara Brezza, declined by 8.4 per cent to 1,47,550 units as compared with 1,61,116 units in February 2018.
However, the production of vans -- Eeco, Omni -- was up by 22.1 per cent to 16,898 units last month as compared with 13,827 units in February 2018. Production of Super Carry LCV was up by just one unit last month.
When contacted, MSI declined to comment on the reasons for taking this production cut.

Maruti Suzuki shared further details on the evolving alliance between Suzuki and Toyota Japan. Additional points covered (relevant from MSIL perspective) in this update are:
a) Widely spread hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technologies in India through local procurement of HEV systems, engines and batteries.
 b) Suzuki to supply two compact vehicles built on the Suzuki platform (Ciaz and Ertiga) to Toyota in India.
 c) OEM supply of Suzuki’s India-produced vehicles (Baleno, Vitara Brezza, Ciaz, Ertiga) to Toyota, targeting the African market.
 d) Drawing upon Suzuki’s expertise in developing vehicles in India, joint development of a Toyota C-segment MPV and OEM supply to Suzuki.
This update has incremental negative impact from MSIL’s perspective, as it shares two additional models with Toyota in India. While we believe this alliance addresses the long-term sustainability issues of MSIL by getting access to EV & hybrid technologies of Toyota, cross-badging of best-selling models of MSIL creates uncertainty due to possibility of cannibalisation.
From the business perspective, we believe that volumes will remain muted till 1QFY20 and then recover from 2QFY20. While large part of the above headwinds is in the price, any further weakness in the stock would offer a very attractive entry price for a strong franchisee with a secular growth opportunity."

 Over the years, the transportation sector has undergone a massive change, including newer modes of transportation – for goods as well as individuals. 
A key player here is the vehicle driver. It has also led to making driver training a must, which has led to mushrooming of drivers’ training institutes. 
For instance, Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) has been actively imparting driver training since the year 2000. The company has set up seven Institutes of Driving and Traffic Research (IDTRs) and over 450 Maruti Driving Schools (MDS) facilities to impart driving training to novices as well as to existing drivers. 
The company has set up IDTRs in collaboration with State governments. Equipped with scientifically engineered training and testing tracks of international standards, modern driving simulators and well-maintained vehicles, these IDTRs follow a structured training content, including classroom lessons and practical sessions. 
IDTR, Vadodara, is a successful model of road safety with jobs for the underprivileged, the company said. 
“The company is working closely with the Ministry of Tribal Development in Gujarat to train tribal youth in safe driving. Besides road safety, this residential IDTR facility near Vadodra approaches driving also as an employment opportunity. In addition to good quality driving training, students also receive training in personality, hygiene, courtesy, and communication,” a senior official at the company said. Nearly 14,000 young tribal people, mostly landless farm workers and unskilled construction workers, have been trained, groomed and 75 per cent of them are employed. Their lives, as those of their families, have transformed, he said.
MSIL has a total of seven such institutes across the country — Rohtak in Haryana, Loni and Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi-NCR, Dehradoon in Uttarakhand, Vadodara in Gujarat and Aurangabad in Bihar. 
Similarly, heavy commercial vehicle makers such as Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland are not far behind passenger car makers such as Maruti Suzuki, as these companies are also training drivers for special skills to drive heavy commercial vehicles. 
For example, Tata Motors has five IDTR operational across the nation which are located at Ajmer (Rajasthan), Silchar (Assam), Pune (Maharashtra), Dimapur (Nagaland) and Mauhana (Punjab).
The company has trained a total of 2,77,997 drivers in the last five years, said a spokesperson at the company adding that the training period depends 36-37 days for a beginner course for heavy duty vehicle driver and as few as two-three days for a ‘Refresher course for Light Moving Vehicle driver’.
And, just like Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland also trains 12,000 fresh drivers and 1,65,450 refresher drivers every year.
It has its institutes in Namakkal, Kaithal (Haryana), Burari (Delhi ), Chindwara (Madhya Pradesh), Chatia (Odisha), Railmagra (Rajasthan), Dharwad and Banglore, Vadodara, Sircilla (Telangana) and Nagpur.

21,2019-04-26,Maruti,"Analysts see rough road ahead for Maruti Suzuki
After posting a below-expected results for the fourth quarter of FY19, shares of Maruti Suzuki India tumbled over 2.2 per to a low of ₹6,749 on the BSE. The shares, however, recovered to close at ₹6,832.15 as the overall market sentiment turned positive towards the closing hours.
Despite recovery in the late hours, analysts are not convinced about the stock. According to them, automobile sector as a whole is facing some headwinds and the stocks will remain under pressure or underperform the market for the next two quarters. A clear, sustainable uptick in auto demand will be seen only from the festive season in the latter half of this year, they opined.
Elara Capital, which revised its stance on Maruti to ‘Accumulate’ from ‘Buy’, said, “While Q4 margin disappointed, we expect it to gradually improve from Q1 FY20 as some one-offs in Q4 may get reversed. We cut our EPS by 6-10 per cent over FY20-21 to factor in lower margin and volume growth.” Elara has a new target price of ₹7,439, down from ₹7,827.
According to CLSA, the demand situation remains very weak right now and “the company is hoping for an improvement only post elections”. Given the uncertainty, it has chosen to give a range guidance (4 per cent if there is no improvement and 8 per cent if the outlook improves in 2H). CLSA, though, maintained its neutral stance, revising the price target upwards to ₹6,300 from ₹6,100.
Narnolia Financial Advisers, said: “Factoring in the uncertain demand scenario, higher fixed cost and depreciation on Gujarat plant, we tweak our FY20 EPS estimates by 5 per cent. We value Maruti at 24x FY20e EPS to arrive at a target price of ₹6,629 and maintain ‘Neutral’ rating.”
However, foreign investment advisor Morgan Stanley remains bullish on Maruti Suzuki. “Maruti’s Q4 EBIT margins are now lower than that of some global mass OEMs, and given the historical track record and strength of franchise, the company will see a sharp rebound in margins,” it said.
Morgan Stanley, which trimmed its EPS estimates for FY2019-20 largely due to lower margins, maintains its price target largely unchanged at ₹8,149 (earlier ₹8,188). Volume weakness in the first quarter of FY20 could give better entry points, the advisory firm said."

20,2019-04-28,Maruti,"Ready for electric vehicles? 
 
The auto sector has been in the thick of action in recent times, with worries over pollution and the need to switch over to electric vehicles (EVs) over the next decade, occupying the centre-stage. With the country taking steps towards establishing the eco system for EVs, it has become imperative for vehicle manufacturers to come up with their plans and for auto component makers to redraw theirs, to suit the new order. How are auto-makers placed to usher in this revolution? And, if you have listed auto and auto component stocks, are your holdings EV-proof?
Moves such as the ban on diesel/petrol vehicles over 10/15 years old from entering NCR, the Supreme Court’s decision to not extend the time line for adoption of BS IV standard fuel across the country and the government’s decision to jump directly to BS VI emission norms by 2020, show that India is getting more and more serious about curbing vehicle pollution.
The most ambitious of all the measures is the plan to switch over to electric vehicles by 2030. A paper titled “India Leaps Ahead: Transformative Mobility Solutions for all” put out by the Niti Aayog (the nodal agency for the EV move) in May 2017 lays out a roadmap to 2030. It bats for 100 per cent electrification of three-wheelers, four-wheeler (commercial) and public transport vehicles, while aiming for 40 per cent electrification in two-wheelers and four-wheelers used for personal transport.
According to the report, if the above mix is achieved, India’s emissions are expected to decline by 37 per cent by 2030. Similarly, energy requirement for transport will come down 64 per cent from what will be required if the current scenario continues until 2030.
 










 
The government has taken this vision forward in Phase II of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid&) Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme which provides demand incentives for EV purchases from April 1, 2019.
Since the costs of EVs tend to be high, demand incentives ranging from ₹20,000 per vehicle for buyers of e-two wheelers to ₹50 lakh per vehicle for e-bus buyers over a period of three fiscal years (initially) is being provided to bring down the end price to customers.
FAME II is in sync with the government’s goal of 100 per cent electrification of public transport by 2030, as it predominantly encourages only electric technology and in that, only lithium ion battery or other newer technology battery-based vehicles; besides, e-buses and e-three-wheelers hog more than half the allocations under FAME, batting for environment-friendly mass transport system. FAME apart, concessional GST rates of 12 per cent is already being provided for EVs to bring down the cost for customers. Conventional fuel vehicles now attract GST rates of 28-50 per cent. Tariffs on imported parts of EVs have also been reduced.
To enable manufacturers lower the production cost, state governments are coming out with various incentives for locating manufacturing units in their States — Karnataka Maharashtra and Uttarakhand are examples. State government policies also provide support for setting up charging infrastructure as well as concessions through various means for customers.
 








 
 
Considering that a wide network of public-charging infrastructure is the very backbone of any mass shift to EVs, the Ministry of Power has been taking various measures to set up charging infrastructure through public sector undertakings such as NTPC. Guidelines and standards for setting up such infrastructure were put out by the Ministry in December 2018. A charging station at every 25 km on both sides of roads/highways is mandated. A phased roll out over the next five years is envisaged.
Besides, to popularise EVs, the Centre has started procuring electric cars for government use through Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), while various state governments have put out their own electrification/procurement targets over the next few years under their respective EV policies.
Thus, the ecosystem is slowly, but surely, growing roots. Seen in the light of lowering lithium-ion battery costs over the last few years and the fact that ISRO has indigenously developed lithium-ion battery technology, these moves indicate that mass production and mass adoption of EVs could indeed be a reality by 2030. Given this scenario, auto makers are leaving no stone unturned to jump on to the EV bandwagon.
Among listed auto players, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is in a comfortable position, being one of the earliest entrants into the EV space through the acquisition of Reva Electric in 2010. Today, the company has come a long way, offering a range of EVs across cars (E2O Plus, eVerito ), three-wheelers (e-ALFA, Treo) and small goods vehicles ( eSupro).
 








 
 
Besides, it will also unveil the electric version of its popular compact SUV KUV 100 in mid-2019. M&M is among the companies supplying EVs for government use through EESL, with an initial order for about 4,800 eVeritos (costing ₹10-15 lakh)
FAME II’s preference for cars used in fleet operations will further benefit the company as M&M has already been partnering with Ola, Zoomcar and Meru for fleet operations. Having entered the fray quite early, the company is now on its second leg of expansion in the EV space. Towards this, it has invested an initial ₹500 crore at its Chakan plant under the new EV policy of the Maharashtra Government. In the second phase of expansion, the company will further ramp up manufacturing and charging infrastructure, develop new, high-end electric powertrains as well as battery technology. Electric mobility is also an area where Mahindra is working in partnership with Ford Motors to develop new products, platforms and other solutions.
Tata Motors is not far behind, having launched its electric bus and electric version of the Tigor passenger car. The buses are currently being sold to government transport undertakings in West Bengal, Jammu, Jaipur, Lucknow, Indore and Guwahati. Though private sale of the e-Tigor has not yet commenced, like M&M, the company is supplying 5050 e-Tigors to EESL (costing ₹10-15 lakh) for government use. Electric versions of small trucks/commercial passenger vehicles such as the Super Ace, Magic Iris and Magic have also been showcased. Thanks to the EV wave across the globe, Tata Motors also has Jaguar Land Rover to lean on for technology support. The all electric Jaguar I-PACE has gone on sale recently. JLR has also announced that all its launches from 2020 will be electrified.
Other listed players — Maruti Suzuki and Ashok Leyland — have taken the partnership route to developing EVs. Throwing its hat in the ring only after the announcement of the government’s 2030 deadline, Maruti Suzuki’s EVs will be co-developed by the global partnership between Toyota and parent company Suzuki, leveraging on the former’s strength in electrification technology and the latter’s strength in making compact vehicles. The company’s first EV is expected to be launched in 2020. Suzuki is also setting up a lithium ion battery plant at about ₹1,100 crore in Gujarat in a joint venture with Toshiba and Denso.
Ashok Leyland already has access to EV technology through its UK-based subsidiary Optare. Last September, the company set up an electric mobility centre in its Ennore plant with facilities for engineering, prototyping and testing for motors, battery modules and packs. This apart, the company has tied up with several organisations (predominantly start-ups) to further its EV inroads in areas such as battery, range extenders and power electronics. For instance, it has joined Sun Mobility, which specialises in smart batteries and quick recharge stations.
Ashok recently introduced the Circuit S e-bus, powered by battery technology from Sun. About 50 of these will be supplied to Ahmedabad Janmarg for intra-city transport. An electric version of its smaller commercial vehicles is also on the cards.
Eicher Motors too has launched its electric buses and is working with its partner Volvo, on a range of public transport options.
Electric two-wheelers have been leading the EV market so far, accounting for over 90 per cent of the country’s EV sales. But the scene is currently dominated by unlisted players. Listed players such as Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto have their tasks thus cut out for meeting the 2030 deadline.
To fast track its EV plunge, Hero MotoCorp has invested in Ather Energy — an IIT-Madras incubated start-up — and has also set up its R&D facility for electric mobility in Jaipur. Ather brought out two e-scooters — the 340 and 450 — in 2018 priced at over ₹1 lakh.
For TVS, the Creon e-scooter is on the cards. While it has also show-cased an electric three-wheeler concept, it is working with another start-up Ultraviolette Automotive for developing premium two-wheelers. Bajaj Auto’s e-scooter — Urbanite — will debut this year. It is also launching e-three-wheelers. Eventually, its Qute quadricycle may also offer an electric option.
Thus, all major listed players are doubling their efforts in a race to meet the government’s 2030 deadline. But despite the incentives, affordability will be an important factor for mass adoption of EVs — be it for personal or commercial use. Making frugal, but reliable, vehicles will be the challenge for the Indian market.
Maruti Suzuki, TVS Motors, Bajaj Auto and Hero Moto Corp — companies focusing on the price-sensitive segments such as commuter bikes and compact cars — will be more vulnerable here. Higher localisation and economies of scale, along with lower battery prices, are key to bringing down the costs. Stiff competition from the large number of unlisted auto makers in India such as Hyundai and Honda — which have a sizeable market share and are also developing EVs with equal enthusiasm — will be a threat to all listed players.
Overall, an interesting decade lies ahead for auto stocks. From being an old economy sector in the last decade or more, the space will be in the spotlight once again over the next ten years. Investors need to keep a close watch on company-specific developments in the EV front, as it may define the prospects for stocks from now on.
With EVs all set to revolutionise the auto industry, it becomes imperative for auto component makers to chalk out their strategies for supplying parts to EVs. The key difference in the EV regime will be the replacement of the internal combustion (IC) engine, transmission and drivetrain parts with batteries, motors and other electronic components. Hence, suppliers of parts such as cylinder blocks/heads, pistons, valves, shafts, fuel injection, clutches, axles, gears, radiators, coolants and lubricants will be impacted. Many companies have begun drawing up their EV strategies to counter this risk of obsolescence.
Global auto component major Bosch, a supplier of fuel injection systems to IC engines worldwide, is gearing to meet this challenge both in India and abroad. The company has developed an integrated electrification system, including motor, control unit, battery and charger that can power two-, three- and four-wheelers.
Bharat Forge, which supplies powertrain parts, is also developing products for EVs. It has set up an EV R&D centre in the UK and has picked up stake in Tork Motorcycles, a drivetrain company focused on electric two-wheelers. It has also invested in Tevva Motors (Jersey), a company that provides electric powertrain solutions to commercial vehicles. Mahindra CIE, another powertrain supplier, is also working with global and Indian clients on their EV portfolio.
With the government focusing on electrifying buses, three-wheelers, two-wheelers and cars initially, companies which supply to trucks are shielded from the move to EVs. Clutch-maker Setco Automotive and steering gear supplier ZF Steering, for instance, supply predominantly to trucks, although they earn some portion of revenues from other vehicle segments. Suspension product-maker Jamna Auto Industries, lighting suppliers Lumax Industries and FIEM Industries, makers of shock absorbers such as Gabriel India and Munjal Showa, and tyre makers are other players that are not impacted negatively by EVs in a big way. Wiring harness-makers such as Motherson Sumi will be impacted positively, as EVs are expected to have higher wiring content per car.
But listed lead-acid battery makers such as Exide and Amara Raja Batteries are in the direct line of fire. But they are taking steps to reinvent themselves to suit the lithium ion battery regime that EVs demand. Exide has tied-up with Lechlance SA based in Switzerland to build these batteries for Indian EVs and is setting up a plant in Gujarat.
Though Amara Raja Batteries had announced the setting up of an assembly plant for lithium ion batteries, the recent termination of its relationship with technology partner Johnson Controls is a worry. Plans of auto manufacturers to set up their own battery plants of EVs also heightens the competition for these two players."

Crude factor Maruti is taking a calculated risk on petrol, given crude pricing uncertainty

Crude factor Maruti is taking a calculated risk on petrol, given crude pricing uncertainty
   -  istock


Maruti Suzuki has been the biggest newsmaker lately, thanks to its announcement on phasing out diesel cars from April 2020.
This is the time Bharat Stage VI emission norms become mandatory and the country’s largest carmaker clearly does not think pursuing with diesel is an economically viable option.
At one level, Maruti is spot-on with its assessment even while some of its top selling models, like the Vitara Brezza, are powered solely by diesel. After all, crude prices have been rising steadily and there is no telling if they will quickly breach the $80/barrel mark in the coming weeks.
By the end of the day, crude is a political commodity that can see wild fluctuations depending on the state of global affairs. For now, the US stance on Iraq as well as the crisis in Venezuela clearly signal a period of uncertainty, which simply means that crude could flare up.
 If this results in breaching the levels of $100/bbl, as some experts fear, then things could get very uncomfortable for emerging markets like India.
It is bad enough that automakers will need to spend quite a bit on new technology for the BS VI era which, in turn, will be passed on to customers. Additionally, the prospects of paying more for fuel will be a double whammy for the end-user.
 For a brand that has constantly focussed on cost-of-ownership, Maruti is clearly of the view that such a scenario will hardly help its cause. Diesel cars are more expensive in any case and if this is accompanied by a hefty rise in the fuel’s price, there is no way customers are going to queue up at showrooms to buy them.
Also, there has been a distinct drop in diesel’s consumption pattern since the time its prices were deregulated and the hefty subsidy component knocked off in the process. During the days of cheap diesel till less than four years ago, the market had virtually given petrol the cold shoulder. These were the days when the price differential between the two was over ₹20/litre. 
This has since reduced to less than ₹7/litre and the effect is there for all to see. Petrol has become the flavour of the season all over again and, except in the case of SUVs in the personal mobility space, diesel has pretty much been relegated to the sidelines. Given this backdrop, there is logic in Maruti’s decision to stop producing diesel cars even while its top management has reiterated that it can revisit the option if so required.
Typically, the company would only be inclined to do this if crude prices crash mysteriously to levels of $40/barrel as was evident during a large part of the BJP regime beginning 2014. 
This would mean that diesel could become affordable all over again and customers will naturally make a beeline for vehicles powered by the fuel.
Yet, there are some hardcore realities to reckon with in a country that is on its way to becoming the third largest automobile producer in the world after China and the US. It is no secret that since the Volkswagen diesel fudging scam broke out in 2015, the fuel has fallen out of favour, especially in Europe.
India, likewise, has had its issues with diesel over the years. During the years it was generously subsidised, environmentalists were furious with what they perceived as pampering fuel-guzzling SUVs. Even as manufacturers protested, these vehicles were often slapped with heavier excise duties by the government. 
The reasoning was that if they operated on cheap fuel, customers had to jolly well be prepared to pay more for them. This issue has died down ever since prices were regulated but diesel vehicles continue to be seen as one of the many culprits in emissions. It was in 2015-16 when Delhi banned the use of 2000cc plus diesel-driven vehicles for nearly eight months and their manufacturers really suffered in the process, since they were denied access to an important market.
 There is no telling what surprises could be in store during the BS VI regime even while automakers insist that cleaner diesel is the best way forward.
After all, it is amply evident across the world (and India) that legislation will play a big role when it comes to vehicular emissions. The industry was truly gobsmacked in March 2017 when it was directed by law to phase out all BS III stocks in less than a week. It was told only to have BS IV-compliant vehicles on the road and this was a clear message that there would be no relaxing of rules, especially when it concerned the environment.
Diesel has been the biggest casualty of all these changes in recent years even while it possibly does not deserve all this bad press. Manufacturers may cry foul but, increasingly, it is evident that the legislation axe will first fall on diesel even if this is seen as being arbitrary and unjust, as in the case of the Delhi ban.
 Maruti may have factored all these issues before deciding to go ahead with this move. But is it taking a big chance in the process? Can it hold its own in a BS VI era against other SUVs from the stables of Mahindra & Mahindra, Hyundai and Ford, which will certainly have diesel in their fuel portfolio?
It is difficult at this point in time to indulge in crystal-ball gazing and predict what the future has in store. Yet, there are some hard truths that just cannot be wished away as detailed above. One, diesel consumption in the personal mobility space has come down dramatically since the time prices were deregulated.
Two, investments in BS VI technology will be considerable and need to be recovered from customers. Diesel vehicles, which are already dearer than petrol, will only get more expensive in the process. Three, crude prices are on the ascent, which means auto fuels will burn a larger hole in customers’ pockets. Four, diesel is rapidly falling out of favour in Europe while the green lobby in India constantly sees it as the villain of the piece when it comes to fouling up the air. Given these obvious headwinds, it was only natural for Maruti to focus on petrol even while it could be a calculated risk, especially from the viewpoint of the uncertainties in crude oil pricing movements.
 The company, though, is more than likely to come up with other fuel options focusing on the cost-of-ownership paradigm. These could include electric, CNG, LPG, etc., where a strong ally like Toyota will extend a huge helping hand. And even if the Brezza does not have a diesel, it could still get one from Toyota in its re-badged avatar as part of the product swap agreement with Suzuki.
History will also reveal that Maruti has hardly been a proactive diesel participant in India’s automobile arena. It was only in 1998, a good 15 years after it set up shop here, that it went in for the TUD5 diesel engine from Automobiles Peugeot (the present Groupe PSA) that was fitted in the Zen.
This was perhaps in reaction to Tata Motors’ decision to have diesel as its driving force for the Indica 20 years ago. It was also evident then that customers were making a beeline for diesel cars, thanks largely to the fact that the fuel was much cheaper than petrol. 
Despite this, Maruti really had no reason to step on the gas with diesel simply because its compact petrol-driven offerings were doing very well in the market. The pace of dieselisation in passenger cars rapidly increased when crude prices went out of control in 2008 and touched levels of $150/bbl. 
Diesel, though, was still heavily subsidised and vehicle sales soared. The honeymoon came to an end when prices were deregulated and customers faced the harsh reality of paying more. 
How the scenario will pan out in the BS VI era remains to be seen even while Maruti has already signalled its intent."

Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) on Tuesday said that it has opened a skill training centre at ITI-Becharaji, in Gujarat, that can provide training to over 7,000 trainees, annually.
“The Centre of Excellence (CoE) at Becharaji was set up in collaboration with the Gujarat government and will be used to train and improve the level of technical education of ITI students of the state and effectively contribute to the Skill India initiative,” Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) said in a statement.
The centre has been set up as part of the initiative to impart relevant skill training and benefit youth in the growing automobile industry making them job ready, the company said.
The CoE will cater to students of ITI-Becharaji and other ITI’s across Gujarat. It will also be used to train shop floor employees from automobile and auto component makers in the state, the company added.
Spread over 11,800 sq ft, the CoE has a capacity to train 150 trainees a week. It is equipped with Maruti Suzuki basic training lab, safety simulation hop, finishing schools for weld shop, paint shop and assembly shop along with six other class-rooms.
“The Centre of Excellence will help students from various trades to enhance their skill sets,” said Kenichi Ayukawa, the MSI Managing Director and CEO, adding that having the right skills is the key to employability.
“Automobile industry is one of the largest employment generating sector. It is important that students across the ITI’s are imparted with the right skill and attitude to earn and sustain employment in the sector,” he added.

Plant shutdowns have become rather routine for automakers, with sales plummeting by the day and no signs of a reprieve in sight.
The first two months of this fiscal have seen sales in free-fall mode. Market leader Maruti Suzuki is reportedly contemplating cutting back on production in the coming weeks. Mahindra & Mahindra has already made its intent known in a communique saying it will go in for a closure of up to 13 days this quarter.
If the slowdown continues, more names could join the list. This is because companies will really have no reason to produce cars/two-wheelers and contribute to inventory pileups at dealerships.
Industry captains are hoping the Budget will bring in some positive news which could draw customers back to showrooms. For now, lending by NBFCs has virtually dried up, which means even interested buyers can’t access loans.








 
Automakers will be hoping that the GST on vehicles is brought down to 18 per cent from the existing 28 per cent, while the Centre will also do its bit to inject liquidity back into the system.
Manufacturers, meantime, are grappling with the pressure of material costs while working round the clock to get ready for the Bharat Stage VI (BS VI) emission norms, which kick off in April 2020.
The slowdown has caught the industry by surprise though it was getting apparent some months ago that demand in urban markets was drying up. This was reflected in falling sales though there was still some optimism that things would soon be back on track.
This was based on the assumption that there would be brisk buying of BS IV products which would be far more affordable than the BS VI options. After all, there are some pretty significant investments going into technology fitments for BS VI vehicles. This will translate into all vehicles becoming dearer.
It was this reality which possibly caused automakers to assume that this fiscal would see buoyant sales of the less expensive BS IV offerings.
The slowdown has caught everyone off-guard and manufacturers are now pretty much resigned to things not looking up till the end of the second quarter.
In the process, the supporting ecosystem, comprising ancillary suppliers and dealers, are also facing the pressure, especially when it means coughing up for overheads like labour costs and rentals. It’s hardly any surprise that dealerships are closing down while tier 2/3 suppliers are walking the tightrope between cutting back on BS IV production and investing in new lines for BS VI.
“It is a nightmare and we can only hope that there is some light at the end of the tunnel,” a supplier told BusinessLine. It’s only logical that following plant closures by their vehicle customers, vendors will also follow suit.
If a long slowdown occurs, things could get really tricky. “We don’t think this will happen and are hopeful that things will look up from October. We are already factoring slow sales for the April-June 2020 quarter, when customers will be lukewarm to expensive BS VI options,” said an industry official."

12,2019-07-21,Maruti,"Future Perfect: Consider calendar put-spread strategy on Maruti
The short-term outlook remained negative for Maruti Suzuki (₹5,768.9). The long-term outlook will turn positive only if Maruti Suzuki breaks ₹6,513 comfortably. If the stock maintains the current downtrend, it could reach ₹5,144, where it finds major support. A break below this level could trigger a heavy fall for Maruti Suzuki.
F&O pointers: Maruti Suzuki futures witnessed a rollover of 17 per cent to next month series. The August futures at ₹5,726.70 trades at a discount to the spot price. This was due to the dividend payout of ₹80 for which the company has fixed August 14 as ex-date, after which the August futures will revert to normal premium mode over the spot price. Option trading indicates a range of ₹5,600-6,000 for the stock.
 










 
Strategy: Shares could see instant movement once Maruti Suzuki’s quarterly results are declared on July 26.
As we see negative bias for the stock, traders can consider a calendar put-spread strategy on Maruti. This can be initiated by selling the current month ₹5,800-strike-put (₹90.05) and, simultaneously, buying the same strike August put (₹281.05). This strategy will cost traders ₹14,325 as the market lot is 75 shares.
The maximum loss would be the premium paid (₹14,325) and that will happen if the stock rises and closes above ₹5,800 in August.
Potential for profit will be very high, if the stock rises in the immediate term and falls from July 26 (next month series). Hold the position till the third week of August and exit if the loss mounts to ₹7,500 or at a profit ₹15,000.
Follow-up: Those who did not book profits when YES Bank surged may do so during the downside too."
11,2019-08-11,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki bounces from a key base 
Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
I bought Maruti at around ₹8,000-8,500 levels. What is your opinion on this stock from a long-term perspective?
Jeevan
Maruti Suzuki India (₹6,101.2): The stock of Maruti Suzuki India has been in an intermediate-term downtrend since encountering a key resistance in the band between ₹9,700 and ₹10,000 in July 2018.
While trending down, the stock had decisively breached key supports at ₹8,500 and ₹6,500 in early July this year and continued to trend down. But a significant long-term support and a 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the prior uptrend at ₹5,500 cushioned the stock.
Subsequently, the stock took support from the level and bounced up gaining 7 per cent accompanied by good volume last week.
Moreover, it formed a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern in the weekly chart, implying short-term trend reversal.
Also, the daily relative strength index and price rate of change indicator are displaying positive divergence, backing the trend reversal. There has been an increase in weekly volume over the past three weeks.
The on-going near-term rally can encounter resistance ahead at ₹6,500.
An emphatic break above this barrier will alter the short-term downtrend and take the stock up to ₹7,000 and ₹7,500 over the medium term. Inability to move beyond ₹7,500 can keep the stock consolidating sideways in a wide range between ₹5,500 and ₹7,500.
Key resistances above ₹7,500 are at ₹8,000 and ₹8,500. But a strong decline below the immediate support level of ₹5,500 will strengthen the downtrend and drag the stock down to ₹5,000 and ₹4,500 in the medium term. Such a fall will also be a threat to the long-term uptrend that has been in place since 2012.
Next key supports below ₹4,500 are placed at ₹4,000 and ₹3,400 levels. You can consider averaging in declines with a stop-loss at ₹5,400 levels and consider booking partial profit at ₹7,500 levels.
What are the short- and long-term prospects for the shares of Strides Pharma Science purchased at ₹486?
S Vanaja
Strides Pharma Science (₹422.1): The stock has been in a sideways consolidation phase in a wide range between ₹335 and ₹510 since May 2018.








 
The long-term trend is down for the stock. After testing the lower boundary of the sideways range in late July, the stock began to trend up. A strong tumble below ₹335 can drag the stock down to ₹300 and ₹260 over the medium to long term.
An emphatic break above the key short-term resistance level ahead at ₹450 can extend the current rally to ₹480 or ₹510 in the short to medium term. You can consider averaging the stock with a stop-loss at ₹335. A conclusive break above ₹510 will pave way for an up-move to ₹600 and ₹650 over the medium term.

Maruti Suzuki XL6




Maruti Suzuki XL6


One of the strengths of car market leader Maruti Suzuki has been its ability to keep an ear to the ground. Notwithstanding, some of the recent pronouncements regarding the future of diesel cars, the general trend over the years has evidenced an uncanny ability to gather actionable market intelligence. 
But that was before the Indian car buyer morphed into a complex being infected with newer preferences and the choice of a whole new range of options. Of course, in the meantime, Maruti has also evolved into a brand that can make premium quality vehicles with a separate NEXA sales channel. The combination of the two evolutions is what the new XL6 is meant to represent."
8,2019-08-30,Maruti,"Priority is to improve fuel efficiency in petrol engines: Maruti Suzuki's CV Raman


CV Raman, Senior ED, Maruti Suzuki




CV Raman, Senior ED, Maruti Suzuki


As Maruti Suzuki gears up for a diesel-free BS VI era from its product portfolio next year, CV Raman, Senior Executive Director, Engineering, and his team are busy working on alternative fuel engines. A whole lot of new technologies are being tested at the Rohtak and Gurugram R&D centres. Raman discusses the fuel roadmap in an interview. Excerpts:
 
All the focus by R&D is on BS VI engines right now. By the end of this year or early 2020 (before March), we will have all our models BS VI-compliant. We have more than 50 variants in terms of petrol, CNG, manual/automatic transmission or AMT.
We have now carried out work for 50 per cent of the models and are now focussing on the balance. There are around 200 engineers entrusted with this responsibly from the overall pool of 1,800-odd we have in R&D. Since our centres in Rohtak and Gurugram cannot handle this on their own, we are using our suppliers’ outfits as well as test facilities of agencies like ICAT and ARAI.
As I just said, this is imperative because we just do not have enough time and space to upgrade all our models from a few centres. Hopefully we are able to meet all the requirements much before the new emission norms kick in from April 1, next year.
Our stance is that BS VI cost (for diesel) will be higher by ₹1-1.5 lakh vis-a-vis each petrol-driven car (industry standards). We will get to know more over the next six to eight months on the acceptance of diesel.
The point I am trying to drive home is whether there will be acceptability at that price level. Equally, it is important to see at what prices competitors will retail their diesel offerings. If certain segments require (diesel), we can certainly work on it.
However, the priority right now is to improve fuel efficiency in petrol engines. We will continue to work in this space where you will also see different levels of technologies emerging. We have smart hybrid and with our alliance with Toyota, we will work on strong hybrids too.
There is also CNG and this will gain momentum as the number of fuelling stations expand across the country. While we will do more localisation on CNG, we are also working with the Centre on methanol blends... R&D work is happening and we are evaluating engines.
It will require different dispensers. This is the main concern and we have to make sure that consumers are careful with its use. After all, the fuel is cheaper but it could end up damaging vehicles. To that extent, methanol is a different proposition.
Ethanol is easier in comparison. We have already made 10 per cent ethanol compliant (E10) and are now working with the Centre to explore the option of increasing this to 20 per cent. However, ethanol is not available across India. The blending levels are barely three to five per cent even though vehicles can meet up to 10 per cent. That is why we have requested the Centre to make it available across India and going beyond the regional-specific model at present.
We stopped auto LPG (in WagonR) because the price was pretty much at par with petrol. We are talking to companies like IndianOil for LPG dispensers. If that works out successfully and if there is also a fall in auto LPG costs, we could perhaps consider this for our vehicles.
The electric vehicle (EV) testing is happening and the key is to see if there is a business case economically. People in India can afford upwards of ₹1 lakh for petrol and diesel options but in the case of an EV, would anybody buy a ₹12 lakh car? If I were to ask anyone at what price they would like to buy an EV, the typical answer would be that it should ideally be ₹1 lakh more than a petrol car. And for an EV to operate and recoup the investments made, only a fleet model can work. This explains why the Centre has also realised this and is kicking off the electric journey with the fleet segment.
Of course, battery technology is an important aspect as well as creation of the right ecosystem for parts and charging infrastructure/grid management. It will be a new business model altogether, which means a mindset change is required.
Battery manufacturers are doing a whole lot of things the world over. The future may be solid state batteries and the challenge is that (battery) capacity is also limited. Let’s see how everything pans out.
It will be very difficult. This option is possible in buses and some of them are already operational on roads. However, it will be difficult when it comes to (private) ownership.
No, we will not look at such things. We are vehicle-makers and there are providers for battery charging who can offer the solutions. We are looking at this space only from a vehicle perspective.

7,2019-09-29,Maruti,"Consider a short strangle on Maruti Suzuki
The long term outlook for Maruti Suzuki India (₹6,773.1) remains positive, while in the short term, it will remain volatile. Only a close above ₹7,660 or below ₹5,480 will dictate a clear trend for the stock. Till then, Maruti will move in the range with a high bout of volatility. Short-term resistance and support appear at ₹7,010 and ₹5,970 respectively. A close above ₹7,660 could trigger a fresh rally in the stock and lift it towards ₹8,250. Similarly, a close below ₹5,480 could weaken the stock towards ₹4,990.
F&O pointers: The Maruti October futures contract witnessed a steady accumulation of open positions in the last two weeks. During the last series, it recovered from a low of ₹5,830.85 to ₹7,188.95 along with increase in open interests. This signals a positive bias, as traders are willing to hold on to the position. Option trading indicates a ₹6,000-7,500 range.
Strategy: Traders can consider a short strangle strategy on Maruti Suzuki. This can be initiated by simultaneously selling ₹7,600-call and ₹5,800-put. These options closed with a premium of ₹62 and ₹30 respectively. Traders will receive an initial inflow of ₹6,900, which is the maximum profit one can earn. For this to happen, Maruti has to move between the strike prices.
However, this strategy can result in heavy loss if the stock moves violently in any one direction — up or down. A close below ₹5,708 or above ₹7,692 will hurt the position. This strategy is strictly for traders who can withstand wild swings and have enough money to meet margin commitments.
Follow up: Hold ITC October call as recommended."

Transmission choices include a 5-speed manual and an Automated Gear Shift


The Renault Kwid firmly established the preference even amongst entry car buyers for an SUV-like body-style. The trend set by gas-guzzling American SUVs was for heft and road presence, which then spread quickly to other markets where drivers (especially women) tended to also feel safe being inside them. Of course, the SUV wave swept into our market too and a decade of development later, our appetite for this body style hasn’t been sated. In fact, even more now than ever before, buyers across segments seem to want an SUV or an SUV-like vehicle.
But make no mistake, nobody in the entry car segment was delusional and bought the Renault Kwid for its assumed heavy, domineering road presence. They bought it for its high-set seating position, good view of the road, and its high ground clearance, which then makes it practical for handling our flooded and pothole-riddled roads. They also bought the Kwid knowing full well that it is still an entry small car with all the compromises which come with that positioning. That is reason enough for more to join the race with their own version of an SUV-like entry small car. Last week, Maruti officially joined the fray with its own. So, can the S-Presso bring in the volumes; will it be able to woo buyers away from the refreshed new Kwid and the Datsun GO with its new CVT gearbox?
 
 
First off, don’t be misled by the pictures, the S-Presso is smaller in the flesh than it seems in the photos. A narrow track and a disproportionately tall build is part of the SUV body-style image that its design is meant to conjure in our heads. It is just a centimetre or two wider and longer than the Alto. But full marks to Maruti’s designers and engineers for trying real hard to give it all the visual attributes of an SUV. The upright A-pillar, the sculpted squared-off wheel arches, The Suzuki Jimny style toothy bonnet grille and the raised position for the LED DRLs make the S-Presso’s front look interesting and SUV-like. The thick, dark grey cladding for the front fender, high shoulder line and the lifted door sill with 180mm ground clearance abets the illusion that this is a mini-SUV.
 






At the rear, the tail-lamps are set high on the haunches and the tailgate is a compact unit that leads to a high-set boot loading lip  
 
At the rear, the tail-lamps are set high on the haunches and the tailgate is a compact unit that leads to a high-set boot loading lip 
 
At the rear, the tail-lamps are set high on the haunches and the tailgate is a compact unit that leads to a high-set boot loading lip. The rear fender is also a contrast grey in my test mule and there is no variant nomenclature (LXi/ VXi etc.) adorning the panels. The tail-lamps are C-shaped and the faux aluminium skid plates for the front and rear (optional accessories; not pictured here) make its SUV styling complete.
Maruti designers say that the S-Presso has a high ‘glass to body’ ratio and that shows in the amount of light that the cabin gets. Also reassuring is the simple straight lines for the shoulder line and windows, so you can be sure that the rear seat is also equally well-lit, unlike some of the older cars like the A-Star. I would have liked grab-type door handles, instead of the lift-up ones that the S-Presso gets. And the 14-inch steel rims look puny within the large wheel arches, taking away from the SUV character; though we all know why small wheels are inevitable.
The S-Presso has been completely designed and developed in India says Maruti’s team and the brief seems to have been to design the cabin also to be a complete departure from the usual small car norm. In keeping with its SUV-styling, the dashboard is quite vertical with all the elements stacked upright. But grabbing all my attention, as soon as I slide on to the high-set driver’s seat, is the circular central unit which houses the digital instrument cluster and the 7-inch infotainment screen right below. Though digital, the dials are a rather simple configuration that sport a speedo and Odo, but misses a tachometer. There are what look like unlit, unused markers on either side of the instrument screen, but they are just dummies. Just below the infotainment screen and within the circular element are the power window buttons; an unintuitive position, but you’ll probably get used to it after a few days of use.
 






Novel and practical The circular centrally positioned instrument display is novel. But the cabin is mostly focussed on being practical  
 
Novel and practical The circular centrally positioned instrument display is novel. But the cabin is mostly focussed on being practical 
 
The optional additions on offer can help spruce up the cabin a bit more with body coloured surrounds for the outer aircon vents and the circular dashboard element. Steering wheel feels good to hold and seems like it is from a segment above with audio, phone and voice command controls; but there is no adjustment for tilt or reach. The seats in the VXi variant I was driving felt good, with decent thigh support even in the rear seat. The front seats are not exactly sporty or large, but do their job well. The seats also don’t get height adjustment and since they are set high, visibility may be a problem for tall passengers. Some of my counterparts were complaining of the rear view mirror getting in the way of their view of the road through the windscreen. Storage options for driver and front passenger are adequate with enough spots for bottles and phones, rear passengers, though, may miss more storage options. Touch-screen infotainment system (only in top two variants) features what Maruti calls the Smartplay Studio - a proprietary suite of applications that can also be operated using your paired smartphone. The system also offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Overall, the cabin feels well made, with the clean edges of the textured plastic imparting a sense of uniformity and reliability, though it is still a lot of plastic all around.
The S-Presso is offered only with the 998cc, K10B petrol engine. Transmission choices include a 5-speed manual (carried over from the Wagon-R) and an Automated Gear Shift (AGS). The K10 engine, also found in other Maruti cars, sees adjustments being made to calibration and changes to the after-treatment making it BS-VI compliant. Hardware changes include three-point pendulum mounts for the engine, making this three-cylinder unit more refined compared to similar units made by the competition. In-cabin noise levels are relatively well contained, though there is a sense of light build that is inescapable. The engine is quite peppy for a car in this segment, producing 50kW of peak power and 90Nm of torque. The S-Presso weighs barely 750 kg on average and it is quite easy to get to speed from standstill. Gear shifts are decent, with just a hint of notchy gating. The AGS is more responsive and features less perceptible shifts than any of the AMTs of the past from Maruti; the worst one was in the first Celerio.
The new car has been built on the 5th-generation Heartect ‘K’ platform, which uses a higher percentage of high tensile steel (part of the reason for the lower weight). The S-Presso is said to meet all current Indian safety regulations including frontal offset, side impact and pedestrian safety. Suspension set up is good for a vehicle in the entry small car segment; though the low kerb weight and high sprung set-up leads to body roll that can be felt at the tall seating position. Safety kit includes dual airbags (passenger airbag is optional addition except in the VXi+ variants), ABS with EBD and rear parking sensors.
The S-Presso’s ride quality is good, feels stable and progressive even during hard braking and there is a general air of assurance while driving over various road conditions. The steering feels good to use, though self-centering and return assistance after u-turns can be bettered. Fuel efficiency is said to be 21.4-21.7 kmpl depending on variant. There are four variants on offer with the AGS being a choice for the top two. But the barebones, base Std variant doesn’t even get an aircon or power steering. Prices start from ₹3.69 lakh and go up to ₹4.91 lakh.
Forget the S-Presso being a mini-SUV, it is practical and is possibly the best entry small car made by Maruti. That is reason enough to consider it."
5,2019-10-22,Maruti,"Here’s how automakers are gearing up for the BS-6 transition 


From offering huge discounts aimed at bringing down the inventory levels of BS-4 vehicles to creating awareness among consumers on the benefits of new technology, automakers are pulling all stops to ensure that they are ready to roll out BS-6 vehicles come April 1, 2020. 
Contrary to the previous transition in emission norms from BS-3 to BS-4, wherein automakers were caught napping and had to liquidate their stock within a matter of a few days before the deadline, this time, automakers are not only better positioned to make the transition to BS-6 norms well within the stipulated deadline, but are also not expecting a fire sale of the BS-4 models.
BusinessLine spoke to automakers to understand how they are gearing up for this transition to BS-6 norms, which has also been identified by most automakers as one of the major reasons for the subdued customer demand in the face of one of the worst slowdowns to beleaguer the automotive industry in recent times.
Back in 2017, just a few days before the deadline for the transition to BS-4 norms, the Supreme Court banned the sale and registration of BS-3 vehicles, leaving automakers staring at a stock of around 8.2 lakh BS-3 vehicles, as it was earlier understood that they will just have to cease the manufacture of new BS-3 vehicles post the deadline, and that they can sell their existing BS-3 stock even after the BS-4 deadline.
In line with the BS-6 transition, Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest carmaker, introduced its first BS-6 compliant model in April 2019, and has already sold 2 lakh BS-6 compliant petrol vehicles, with eight of its 16 models being BS-6 compliant now. It has already stopped production of BS-4 cars for these eight models in which BS-6 models have been introduced, said Shashank Srivastava, Executive Director, Marketing & Sales, Maruti Suzuki India Limited. For the rest of the models, the decision to cease BS-4 production will be taken keeping in mind the inventory levels, he added.
Srivastava said that Maruti has a “very balanced inventory” of BS-4 vehicles and that it doesn’t seem like there will be a fire sale.
“The current discounts are at an all-time high and we don’t think it will go beyond this level. Also, the production plan of most of the companies are aligned to BS-6 implementation and soon the BS-4 stocks will finish without prompting any fire sale.” affirmed Rajesh Goel, Senior Vice President & Director, Sales and Marketing, Honda Cars India.
Suraj Ghosh, Principal Analyst, Powertrain & Compliance Forecasts, IHS Markit, said that most OEMs would be clearing their inventories by February or March, and that there wouldn’t be a fire sale in its actual sense. “If there’s ever a sales period with heavy discounts, then it’s going to be this quarter, particularly the last month,” he added.
Ashish Modani, Vice-President and Co-Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA, also said that the discounts are already high and that the likelihood of any fire sale – which is almost non-existent – will be specific to a particular OEM or dealership. From an industry point of view, the industry is much prepared this time, compared to the BS-3 to BS-4 transition, he said.
In order to boost consumer sentiments at a time like this, Maruti has undertaken efforts like promotional offers of up to 1 lakh, price cuts to share the benefit from the corporate tax cut, easier finance availability by approaching banks for attractive finance schemes and an enhanced reach in sales and services through the launch of Mobile NEXA Terminal.
Honda Cars is also providing offers under ‘The Great Honda Fest’, which is helping it maintain sales of its BS-4 vehicles, said Goel. Honda Cars has also tied up with multiple banks and financial institutions to offer upto 100 percent on-road financing, low EMI packages and long-tenure loans to make the purchase process more attractive. “We are confident about clearing our BS-4 stock well in time before BS-6 implementation...We will do a sequential changeover to BS-6 from Q4 of FY19-20,” said Goel.
Additionally, taking into consideration the apprehensions beleaguering customers post the announcement about the discontinuation of smaller diesel vehicles, Maruti has rolled out a 5-year, 1-lakh km warranty on its four diesel powered cars, namely Dzire, S-Cross, Swift and Vitara Brezza. Customers’ confusion about the continuance of Vitara Brezza and S-Cross – which are currently available in diesel only – made them hold back their purchases, and Maruti plans to introduce petrol variants of these two models in the coming months, said Srivastava.
Goel said that the market has definitely moved towards petrol in many segments and that Honda Cars will also be aligning its production mix in line with the market demand. Honda Cars is planning to continue with its diesel models post the BS-6 implementation, he added.
In order to salve customers’ apprehensions about the BS-6 transition, Srivastava said that Maruti has also created extensive training modules for its front line teams and dealer sales executives on doubts related to the transition, as they are the ones interacting with customers on a day-to-day basis.
Hyundai, on the other hand, is offering petrol BS-6 engines with its Grand i10 NIOS and New 2017 ELANTRA. “We will be fully ready before the BS-6 implementation from April 2020...We have optimum levels of inventory for BS-4 and BS-6 cars,” said Puneet Anand, Sr. GM & Group Head - Marketing, Hyundai Motor India. It has also rolled out a Mega Festival Campaign, offering “smart deals on wheels, big benefits and assured early deliveries” on some of its brands in a bid to boost sentiments during the festive season.
At Toyota Kirloskar Motors Ltd, in the light of its challenges with Innova and Fortuner where the price hike is going to be severe post the transition, and is currently being discussed at Toyota, the company is trying to educate customers about the price hike and provide them with solutions in both BS-4 and BS-6, as per their needs, to help them make an informed decision, said N. Raja, Deputy Managing Director, TKM.
“Toyota production is based on a ‘pull system’ which helps us regulate how much is required by when and how, thereby regulating production basis the market demand. Therefore, we would monitor such elements so as to ensure no BS-4 vehicle stock beyond March 31, 2020,” said Raja.
Raja added that since customer preferences will vary depending on whether the purchase is made for personal or fleet use, and price forms an important aspect for fleet customers, the company’s biggest challenge will be to predict such customer-specific demand accurately.
At Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, it is taking efforts to educate customers on the BS-6 technology, said a Mahindra spokesperson. “All our marketing efforts will be to promote our differentiated value proposition of clean emissions and fuel efficiency with thrilling performance of our vehicles,” the spokesperson stated, adding that currently, it is up to the customers to take advantage of the existing price levels which are inclusive of festive offers to buy BS-4 diesel vehicles.
“At Mahindra, we are planning a smooth transition, with a ramp-down for BS-4 and ramp-up of BS-6 in such a way that the overlap will be minimal. In case of rare overlaps, customers will have the option to choose between BS-4 and BS-6 vehicles and will get price benefits on BS-4 vehicles. Since we cannot switch overnight from selling BS-4 to BS-6, we will start selling BS-6 vehicles and tone down BS-4 vehicles in a phased manner. For BS-6 diesel vehicles, availability of BS-6 fuel is crucial,” the spokesperson added.
A Volkswagen spokesperson said that the company is currently evaluating the market and is aligned with the Indian government’s vision. “Volkswagen carlines will be compliant well within the time period. To this effect, our on-ground sales and service consultants are well-trained to provide required advice and support to our customers,” the spokesperson said.
Honda Cars’ Goel said that from a customer’s perspective, it is the best time now to make a car purchase since the discounts are at an “all-time high”.
“The same car in BS-6 version will be more expensive and without these discounts. Even if one considers the resale value of a BS-6 car versus a BS-4 car, the current upfront discounts on buying cars now make the total cost of ownership more favourable for BS-4 cars,” said Goel.
Any undue confusion among customers about the viability of BS-4 vehicles has also been clarified by the government when it reiterated that all BS-4 vehicles registered till March 31, 2020 will continue to be operational for the entire period of registration, and this also means that there should not be any hesitance in buying BS-4 vehicles, Goel pointed out.
The demand is better than what it was a few months back because customers have understood that this is the best time to buy cars, added Goel. Since the festive period is ongoing now, it remains to be seen how the demand progresses in later months, he said."
4,2019-10-24,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki Q2 Results: Weak performance despite corporate tax cuts

Given that automobile sales have been nothing to write home about, Maruti Suzuki’s 39.3 per cent fall in profits to Rs 1358 crore in the quarter ended September 2019 (over the September 2018 quarter) does not come as a surprise. In fact, the fall in profits could have been worse, if not for the 78 per cent drop in tax expenses to Rs 213 crore. The company has been a beneficiary of reduction in corporate tax rate announced by the government. In 2018-19, the company’s effective tax rate stood at 29 per cent, higher than the new rate of 25.7 per cent. Profits were also helped by 75 per cent rise in ‘other income’ to Rs 920 crore and a drop in ‘other expenses’ by 15 per cent. Though sales promotion expenses were high thanks to the ongoing discounts, cost control efforts helped.
Despite a 30 per cent fall in volumes, improvement in average realisation per vehicle from Rs 4.44 lakh a year to Rs 4.76 lakh helped arrest the decline in net sales to a lower 25.2 per cent. Net sales came in at Rs 16120 crore. Lack of operating leverage due to poor volumes impacted profitability at the operating level sharply. Raw material cost as a percentage of sales too inched up to 74.7 per cent from 70.8 per cent a year ago. Thus, operating margins for the company contracted by 5.8 percentage points to just 9.4 per cent.
Given the ongoing discounts to push up sales and lower interest costs, the festival month of October could see new vehicle sales picking up a bit. But uncertainties surrounding the BS VI transition and higher transactions costs still remain a dampener for vehicle sales until the end of this fiscal.

Size S: Smaller than a regular SUV, the S-Presso is better suited for congested roads




Size S: Smaller than a regular SUV, the S-Presso is better suited for congested roads


We are on the highways of Rajasthan, test-driving the new S-Presso. Whenever we stop for a tea break, the questions we hear are the same — how much does it cost, and how low is the mileage?
These are not issues that trouble Gen-X, who have been eyeing the new wheels with considerable interest. Its maker, Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL), calls the small car a ‘mini SUV’ because of its distinct sports utility vehicle character — and that’s what appeals to the young.
Sameer (name changed), a 29-year-old employee of a multinational company, is happy with his latest possession — and the admiring glances it has been drawing on the road.
“The best part is I got the S-Presso delivered within 10 days of the launch and, since it’s very rare on the roads, people sometimes tell me that they’ve not seen anything like this and ask me if it is imported,” he says.
An added appeal for the younger generation is that despite the car’s sporty looks, it costs considerably less, and, being smaller than a regular SUV, is easier to drive and park on congested roads.
The S-Presso, launched on September 30, targets the section of young buyers that likes to get its hands on something new before anybody else — quite like the way they vie for the latest iPhone.
“We are confident that S-Presso will bring excitement in its segment, attracting the ever-evolving young customer,” MSIL managing director and CEO Kenichi Ayukawa said at the launch.
Built on Suzuki’s Fifth Generation HEARTECT (greater rigidity, stability and control to the driver) platform, the S-Presso is compliant with all the latest Indian safety regulations including frontal offset crash, side impact and pedestrian safety.
Its safety features include dual airbags, anti-lock-braking system (ABS) with electronic brake force distribution (EBD), seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters (which pull the driver and passenger firmly to their seat in the event of a collision), driver/co-driver seatbelt reminder, rear parking assist system, high-speed warning alert and reverse parking sensors.
These features, hitherto available in some high-end cars and SUVs, are part of new vehicular safety norms.
MSIL hopes that S-Presso’s USP — like its name, which conjures up an alluring image of steaming coffee — will be its ability to lure millennial eyeballs. It hopes to attract those who’d love to drive an SUV but cannot afford one yet.
“I have driven a compact SUV, but now I have booked an S-Presso because the bigger vehicle entails higher maintenance. The S-Presso will cost us less in maintenance while giving the feel of driving an SUV,” says Shruti (name changed), a 35-year-old employee of a marketing firm.
The main competitor in the S-Presso segment is the all-new Renualt Kwid, which also has an ‘SUV-inspired’ look and features such as a touchscreen and funky gear knob for its automatic version.
“The SUV-inspired Renault Kwid has been a true game-changer and volume driver for Renault India. The all-new Kwid’s next-gen technology combined with its sleek style and innovative design will ensure that Kwid continues to be a major disruptor in India’s entry car segment,” Venkatram Mamillapalle, country chief executive officer and managing director, Renault India Operations, said at the launch of Kwid last month.
The S-Presso has a proven 1.0 L K10 engine with BS6 compliance and is equipped with both manual and AGS (Auto Gear Shift).
Not everybody, however, likes S-Presso’s tall body design — described by critics as a ‘soap box-like’ or ‘boxy’. But since the launch, MSIL says it has been getting 700-800 bookings every day for the vehicle. The bold colours — orange, blue, granite grey, silver, red and white — appeal to the young, it says.
Most buyers have opted for the top two versions — VXI and VXI+ — priced between ₹4.24 lakh and ₹4.91 lakh (ex-showroom). It gives about 22km per litre (test conditions). The standard S-Presso is for ₹3.69 lakh (ex-showroom).

“We launched the S-Presso to match the changing needs, tastes and lifestyles of our young customers,” says Shashank Srivastava, executive director — marketing & sales, Maruti Suzuki India. “The S-Presso has been appreciated by customers across India for its commanding position, road visibility and pick-up. We are hopeful that it will bring disruption in the segment.”
He may be right, for in my 200-km drive from Jodhpur to Khimsar and back in two days, I was comfortable with the seating positions, the leg space and the shoulder room. I have constant back pains, and have to keep adjusting the driver’s seat to ease the pressure on the muscles. With the S-Presso, I didn’t have to do that even once. That, for me, was the icing on the cake."
2,2019-11-11,Maruti,"Maruti Ertiga leads the market in MPV segment
 
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd's (MSIL) multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) Ertiga has emerged as the largest selling product in its segment, while Toyota Kirloskar Motor's (TKM) famous brand Innova Crysta has fallen in sales during April-October period.
According to numbers gathered from the various dealers’ sources across the country, the sales of Ertiga is growing and is selling around 8,000 units a month. Between April and October this year, the company has sold 55,608 units as compared with 28,464 units in the corresponding period last year, growing by 95 per cent year-on-year (YoY). Whereas, TKM has sold 35,014 units of the Innova Crysta during this period, down 24 per cent YoY, against 46,047 units in April-October 2018.
On the monthly basis also MSIL sold 7,197 units of the Ertiga during October, while TKM sold 5,062 units of the Innova Crysta.
Interestingly, MSIL's latest product – XL6 in the same segment – is also drawing more customers, as pricing of the product is made 'affordable' for the segment buyers. The Ertiga is priced between ₹8 lakh and ₹10 lakh, the XL6 costs between ₹9.80 lakh and ₹11.46 lakh (all ex-showroom, New Delhi).
Shashank Srivastava, Executive Director (Marketing & Sales) Maruti Suzuki India told BusinessLine that ""Customer expectations from an MPV today are not just limited to space but they aspire for one with good design, comfort and technologically advanced features that would make them stand out. Both Ertiga and XL6 meet these changing aspirations of customers. On one hand Ertiga is spacious, comfortable and practical MPV to customers whereas XL6 offers a modern design coupled with exclusive captain seats and chic interiors.""
Apart from the pricing, the advantage that Ertiga and XL6 both get is that they are available in BS-VI petrol, as per the latest norm which will come up from April 2020. However, the diesel variant of the Ertiga will soon discontinue as it is not ready with BS-VI engine yet and MSIL does not have the technology yet on BS-VI diesel. Both Ertiga and XL6 are powered by K15 petrol Smart Hybrid engine with Li-ion battery.
On the other hand, TKM is ready with the BS-VI engines and is ready to roll out the newer versions of the Innova Crysta, but because of the lack of fuel availability across the country, the company is delaying the launch, sources from the company said. The BS-VI fuel (both petrol and diesel) is available only in Delhi-NCR right now.
According to a company official, the sales of the Innova Crysta is down compared to last year because of the various reasons, including economic downturn and that is why people are buying on need base, and also newer models from competitors at lower price.
The price of the Innova Crysta starts around ₹15 lakh for the petrol (BS-IV) version going up to ₹22 lakh , the diesel (BS-IV) starts at around ₹15.70 lakh and goes up to ₹24 lakh (all ex-showroom, New Delhi). However, the engines of MPV from Toyota are much more powerful as compared to any product in this segment. While its petrol engine is available in 2.7 Litres, the diesel has two options - 2.4L and 2.8L.

1,2019-12-05,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki to recall one lakh units of smart-hybrid variants of Ciaz, Ertiga, XL6 
 The country’s largest passenger car maker, Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL), will recall around one-lakh vehicles of its second-generation smart-hybrid vehicles, including the Ciaz, the Ertiga and the recently launched XL6 due to the lithium-ion battery fire hazard.
Various sources BusinessLine spoke to said that there have been at least two cases in the recent past, in which the lithium-ion battery, under the passenger seat in front, had caught fire.
“It is mainly due to the new lithium-ion battery fitted in the new smart hybrid technology cars over the last one year. There were a few cases of fire in the recent past,” a source privy to the matter told BusinessLine.
According to sources, there are more than three lakh mild and smart hybrid Maruti cars on the road today.
This is likely to be one of the biggest recalls by the company. Recently, the company announced a voluntary recall of 40,618 units of the WagonR (1 litre) manufactured between November 15, 2018 and August 12, 2019. 
The recall campaigns were undertaken globally to rectify potential safety defects. 
Calls and messages to a Maruti spokesperson remained unanswered. 
The monthly sales of the XL6 and the Ertiga, have averaged around 4,200 units and 7,000 units, respectively. 
 However, sales of the Ciaz have been falling. In November, MSIL sold 1,148 units of the Ciaz, which was a decline of 62 per cent year-on-year (versus 3,838 units) and in October it sold 2,371 units of the mid-size sedan against 3,892 units in October 2018."

Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) has officially announced that it is recalling smart hybrid (SHVS) variants of its mid-sized sedan Ciaz, and multi purpose vehicles Ertiga and XL6.
BusinessLine on Thursday had written that the company will be recalling around one-lakh of these vehicles due to fault in their battery system.








 
The company said it will “proactively and voluntarily undertake a recall for certain petrol Smart Hybrid variants of Ciaz, Ertiga and XL6 vehicles manufactured between January 1 and November 21, 2019.”
The company said recall campaigns are undertaken globally to rectify faults that may be ‘potential safety defects’.
“The company will inspect 63,493 vehicles of petrol SHVS of Ciaz, Ertiga and XL6 for a possible issue with the Motor Generator Unit (MGU). A possible defect may have occurred in the MGU during manufacturing by an overseas global part supplier,” MSIL said in a statement.








 
In the interest of its customers, Maruti Suzuki has decided to proactively recall the vehicles for inspection and those found OK will be released immediately, it said.
“Vehicles requiring replacement of faulty part will be retained for part replacement free of cost. Keeping in view customer convenience, Maruti Suzuki dealers may make alternate mobility arrangements in such cases, if required,” it said.
Starting Friday owners of the suspected vehicles under this recall campaign will be contacted by Maruti Suzuki dealers for inspection and replacement of the faulty part, it added.
This is likely to be one of the biggest recalls by the company. Recently, the company announced a voluntary recall of 40,618 units of the WagonR (1 litre) manufactured between November 15, 2018 and August 12, 2019.
