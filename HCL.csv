66,2018-05-02,HCL,"HCL Tech profit falls 9.8% to ₹2,230 crore in Q4
 HCL Technologies reported a 9.8 per cent dip in consolidated net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 2018 at ₹2,230 crore against ₹2,474 crore for the same quarter in 2017.
The company’s revenue grew 2.2 per cent for the period at ₹13,480 crore as opposed to ₹13,183 crore for the same quarter in the previous fiscal.
Talking to media persons after the board meeting, C Vijayakumar, Chief Executive Officer, said that this revenue increase was backed by the strong broad-based growth across verticals, robust client additions, and accelerated revenues from Mode 2 and Mode 3 services. 
“We remain confident about the new fiscal in the light of increasing relevance of our business offering coupled with strategic investments in technology in future,” he added. For the year ended March 2018, the company registered a net profit of ₹8,722 crore, was up 1.3 per cent from ₹8,606 for the fiscal year 2017. Revenues grew 6.4 per cent from ₹48, 641 crore to ₹51,786 crore.
Revenues from Mode 2 and Mode 3, which focus on emerging technologies and IP creation, together grew 41.5 per cent for the fiscal 2018.
 Revenues from the two segments account for 23.4 per cent against 18.6 per cent for fiscal 2017.
Growth across verticals is driven by manufacturing at 18.3 per cent, financial services at 13.3 per cent, lifesciences and healthcare at 8.1 per cent, retail and CPG at 7.5 per cent and public services at 2.6 per cent on constant currency basis. 
For financial year 2019 revenues are expected to grow 9.5-11.5 per cent in constant currency. 
Total employee count stood at 1.2 lakh with gross addition of 8,476 people. Attrition rate for IT services was 15.5 per cent."
65,2018-05-02,HCL,"HCL will focus on next-gen tech: Vijayakumar


C Vijayakumar, Chief Executive Officer of HCL Technologies, is clear about where he wants the company to be positioned – at the cutting edge of disruptive technology.
In the last two years, the company invested $100 million in creating digital infrastructure such as experience design centres, IoT and Cloud labs. The company is investing in start-ups that offer cutting-edge technology as well. In a interview with BusinessLine, Vijayakumar shared the company’s future strategy, growth prospects and why India is not a focus market. Excerpts:
Start-ups are next big thing which all established players are looking at. Is HCL Technologies also proposing to work with any one of them?
The company has already started investing in couple of start-ups. HCL Technologies invested close to $2-3 million in Moogsoft, which offers AI solutions for IT operations.
It is also working on start-up venture partnerships through Morado Ventures, in which HCL has invested, for funding more start-ups. These are helping us gain some capability in cutting-edge disruptive technology.
What are the growth drivers for your company?
Though company’s major share of revenue comes from engineering, services, applications and infrastructure that constitute Mode 1, revenues from next-gen services (Mode 2) and IP offerings (Mode 3) are also on the rise. For the fiscal ended March 2018, Mode 2 and Mode 3 offerings accounted for 23.4 per cent of overall revenue compared to 18.6 per cent the previous fiscal.
As corporate enterprises re-image their businesses spending on traditional technologies will see a compression. But, it will be compensated by the investment in emerging technologies and IP offering. The company has invested close to $1.2 billion in IP partnerships, in-house IP creation and acquisition in the last two years.
Are you open to more acquisitions?
We are open to more acquisitions if opportunities were to arise and investments will be in line with previous years. The company is also looking to strengthen its presence in Germany, Australia, Canada and South Africa.
Does it mean India is not a focus market...?
India is not one of the focus market. Though there are projects in India, as a strategy we are reducing our focus. On the enterprise and niche segments, we will continue to participate, but we will be selective.
Though technology consumption is on the increase in the country, we have to figure out what it means for the company and how it fits in with their priorities.
The primary reason for reducing focus in India is the long-gestation period for SI projects and lot of capital gets stuck.
HCL has a large revenue base. Almost 99.9 per cent of the clients are global clients. So we want to focus on them, protect our revenues and also grow the revenues."

C Vijayakumar, CEO, HCL Tech




C Vijayakumar, CEO, HCL Tech


The March quarter results reiterated the pecking order of financial performance among the top four domestic IT players.
HCL Technologies delivered a better financial performance than what Infosys and Wipro reported, but fell short of TCS’ figures for the period.
The company’s revenues during the fourth quarter increased 2.5 per cent sequentially, compared to the 1.8-3.9 per cent growth delivered by peers.
Healthy client additions, stability in metrics such as utilisation and attrition, and traction across several verticals were positives during the period.
The operating margin was steady, at 19.6 per cent for the quarter.
The double-digit revenue growth guidance for FY19 should have given markets enough reason to cheer. Instead, the stock price corrected significantly(nearly 5 per cent), indicating concerns that much of the growth projection may be attributable to a series of acquisitions that HCL made in recent months and not its organic performance.








 
 
All-round performance
Revenues from segments such as financial services, public services, retail and telecom increased at a pace that equalled or exceeded the overall company’s revenue rate, indicating healthy broad-based growth.
HCL managed to add three customers in the $50-million category, two each in the $30-million and $20-million buckets and four clients in the $10-million segment. These additions were among the best in the industry during the period.
Utilisation, at 85.9 per cent and attrition, at 15.5 per cent compared quite favourably with the figures reported by peers. In FY18, HCL’s revenues grew at 12.4 over the previous fiscal, much higher than the 7-8 per cent growth rate for the industry. Trade body Nasscom has projected a 7-9 per cent growth rate for the IT industry in 2018-19. HCL has guided for 9.5-11.5 per cent revenue growth in FY19. Infosys gave projections for a 7-9 per cent increase.
But quite strangely, HCL’s stock trades at a little over 15 times its trailing 12 months’ per share earnings, lower than the valuation multiple demanded by Infosys and Wipro, despite growing at a much faster clip than these two companies. TCS, which trades at a price-earnings multiple of 25 times, is way ahead though.
HCL’s growth trajectory demands that it be accorded a price-earnings multiple that is at least equal, if not higher than what is given to Infosys and Wipro (17 times)."

The stock posted its biggest intraday percentage loss since October 2015, and was the top loser on the NSE index.


Shares of HCL Technologies fell the most in 2-1/2 years. The stock extended its decline for a second session; it was down as much as 7.8 per cent at Rs 922.35, its lowest since March 23.
The stock posted its biggest intraday percentage loss since October 2015, and was the top loser on the NSE index.
The software services exporter's Q4 profit fell nearly 10 per cent, missing analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company expects FY19 revenue to rise 9.5-11.5 per cent in constant currency terms.
Q4 was a tad weaker than expected, and the revenue growth guidance doesn't reflect any acceleration in growth for the company, analysts at HSBC said, downgrading the stock to “hold” with a price target of Rs 1,050.
“While IMS deals have picked up, pricing compression at renewals continue,” says Macquarie; it has retained “outperform” rating with a price target of Rs 1,160.
Results were largely in-line, but organic revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2019 were disappointing, according to Morgan Stanley. It has kept “overweight” rating with a price target of Rs 1,060.
Analysts at Citi say guidance implies muted organic growth; it has maintained “neutral” rating with a price target of Rs 1,035. Key investor concern will be on IMS business growth and significant inorganic growth, according to Citi.
About 27 out of 43 brokerages have rated the stock “buy” or higher, 11 “hold” and 5 “sell” or lower; their median price target is Rs 1,055, Thomson Reuters data."
62,2018-05-22,HCL,"HCL Technologies joins hands with Blockchain in Transportation Alliance 
 
HCL Technologies has joined Blockchain in Transportation Alliance (BiTA), a consortium that works on blockchain-based solutions for the transportation industry, to develop blockchain-based solutions for the industry. BiTA’s members include Descartes, Daimler, FedEx, SAP and Uber Freight. 
Blockchain allows tracking of goods and freight across the supply chain effectively. It will also allow transportation and logistics companies to operate in a more seamless and transparent manner. It will help to create new revenue streams and value for customers by enabling a system of completing transactions, tracking shipments, and managing fleets. 
“HCL’s partnership with BiTA and working alongside other global industry leaders in transportation, logistics, and supply chain, will allow us to engage in the development of standards for how blockchain technology will be used in such transportation activities as track and trace, provenance, smart contract management, compliance management, and fraud detection,” said Ajay Bahl, Executive Vice-President and Head of Public Services and Manufacturing Business (North America) at HCL Technologies. 
“By helping to develop a common framework and standards by working with industry participants, we will promote broad adoption of this disruptive digital technology for transportation and logistics,” he added."
61,2018-05-27,HCL,"HCL Technologies: IT’s looking up
Among large IT companies, HCL Technologies (HCL) has almost always delivered growth rates that have been ahead of the industry. The company has been among the few in the domestic IT space to have consistently recorded double-digit revenue growth in dollar terms over the past several years.
The stock has corrected by nearly 15 per cent after its March quarter results were announced, as its revenue growth guidance for FY-19 disappointed the markets. A good part of its projected growth (9.5-11.5 per cent) is expected from the companies it acquired recently. But the correction may have been an overreaction, as the growth rates are still among the best in the industry.
Companies do need to take the inorganic route to grow and explore newer niche digital services areas and HCL has consciously made acquisitions that add to its offerings. To put HCL’s guidance in perspective, trade body Nasscom has projected a growth rate of 7-9 per cent for the IT industry in FY-19.
Strong expansion in revenues from digital offerings, healthy client additions and robust traction in key verticals such as financial services and manufacturing are positives for the company.








 
 
The fall in share price presents an even more attractive entry point for investors with a two-year horizon. At ₹915, the HCL stock trades at just 13 times its estimated per share earnings for FY-19, lower than peers such as Wipro and Tech Mahindra that trade at 15-17 times. This valuation discount does not appear justified, given that HCL has better operating margins and revenue growth rates compared to its peers. Even mid-tier IT players trade at much higher multiples.
In FY-18, HCL’s revenues increased by 8.2 per cent over the previous fiscal to ₹50,570 crore, while net profits rose by 3.8 per cent to ₹8,780 crore. In dollar terms, revenues increased by a healthy 12.4 per cent in 2017-18, which is the highest among top-tier IT players and also among the best in the industry.
Digital thrust
HCL classifies its service offering under three ‘modes’. Mode 1 is its traditional application and infrastructure services offering. Mode 2 refers to digital services, while mode 3 consists of products and platforms. The company has seen a massive ramp-up in revenues from mode 2 and mode 3 offerings.
HCL derived 23.4 per cent of its revenues from these modes in FY-18, up from 18.6 per cent in the previous fiscal. Revenues from both these modes are growing at a fast clip — mode 2 revenues rose by 29.4 per cent and mode 3 by 68.3 per cent in FY-18. Clearly, HCL has been able to tap into the digital spends of clients.
The company’s acquisition of Actian Corporation, through a joint venture with Sumeru Equity Partners, is expected to bolster its digital and cloud offerings.
The proportion of non-traditional revenues that HCL derives compares favourably with what other top-tier IT players have recorded.








 
Broad-based growth
Two of the HCL’s key verticals — financial services and manufacturing — which account for over 60 per cent of overall revenues have grown at 13.3 per cent and 18.3 per cent respectively in FY-18, higher than the overall company’s revenue rate.
Its engineering and R&D service line grew at a robust pace of 37.8 per cent during last fiscal. HCL’s key infrastructure management services offering, which had a few tepid quarters, has witnessed a revival in the March period.
Revenues from all its key geographies have expanded at a reasonable pace, with the US growing at a robust 13.8 per cent.
Clearly, the growth has been broad-based for the company, suggesting a fair degree of client traction. HCL added three customers in the $50-million category, six in the $40 million bucket and as many as 18 clients in the $10-30 million range. Thus, client addition appears quite robust for the company.
Operationally, many parameters are looking up for the company.
The company’s attrition rate has reduced from 16.9 per cent as of March 2017 to 15.5 per cent as of March 2018, thus lowering execution risks.
Utilisation for HCL was at 85.9 per cent in March 2018, which is among the highest in the industry, indicating optimal deployment of its workforce.
From a productivity standpoint, HCL’s revenue per employee, at $66,406 in FY-18, compares quite favourably with peers. The revenue per employee for Infosys is $54,600.
While acquisitions would drive growth in the near future, HCL’s core offerings, as seen from the above factors, appear to be on a revival path.
The stock may, thus, be a reasonable bet for long-term investors and those looking at defensives to hedge themselves during volatile times."

“A meeting of the board of directors of the company is scheduled to be held on Thursday, July 12, 2018, to consider a proposal for buyback of equity shares of the company,” HCL Technologies had said in a BSE filing on Monday.
The announcement comes within a month of TCS, the country’s largest software exporter, declaring a Rs 16,000 crore share buyback programme. It had offered to buy back shares at a premium of more than 15 per cent at Rs 2,100 a share.
Details of HCL Technologies share buyback are expected to be firmed up on July 12 when its board will discuss the proposal. It had, last year, offered buyback of shares at Rs 1,000 apiece, a 17 per cent premium over its prevailing trading price at that time.
IDBI Capital says: “Expect HCLT to announce a buyback quantum similar to its buyback last year of around Rs 3500 crore.’’
Buyback of Rs 3,500 crore would utilise about 48 per cent of surplus cash as of end-FY18 and would be about 9.5 per cent of its net worth which would enable it to do buyback with the approval of its board, IDBI Capital adds.

C Vijayakumar, CEO, HCL Technologies Ltd is confident that the acquisition strategy will pay off. The company has been investing significantly in inorganic growth with three acquisitions in the last quarter. In an interaction with BusinessLine, Vijayakumar talks about the way forward and more. Excerpts:
There have been murmurs of discontent regarding the recent acquisitions given their stagnant revenue growth. What is your stand on that?
Both organic and inorganic require a lot of effort. If you are looking at our inorganic, we are not diluting our margins. These are the metrics one should look at when seeing if inorganic growth works or not. We are consciously driving it.
Look at life sciences and consumer services company C3i Solutions. It was part of a company called Merck & Co, a lot of their contracts were pulled as they were unable to reach out to more service providers, revenues were stagnant and valuation was $60 million. But it is adding core capabilities. They have low margins but we will increase that over a period of time. Actian Corporation is in hybrid data space, which is very hot, growing at 50 per cent YoY. Its products are growing but in one significant product line they have discontinued. Also they did not have a channel like HCL. Now it will create momentum and traction.
H&D International acquisition was only about Germany. They are over a 1,000 people and demonstrates our commitment to geography.
Are more acquisitions in the pipeline?
We are looking at digital acquisition even as we are making organic investments. Almost 15-16 per cent of our services category is in Mode 2. There is a lot of market demand. To fulfil it better , a couple of digital acquisitions are definitely needed. We are looking at the marketing space and digital design studios.
What about your Mode 1 services, core businesses like infrastructure and engineering?
We want to make sure that Mode 1 is also growing. For example if you look at the infrastructure business, there are lot of programme to modernise infrastructure for digital transformation. We are trying to pitch for those programmes and win them."

46,2018-08-27,HCL,"HCL Technologies faces key barrier ahead
Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
What is the short- and long-term view for HCL Technologies?
Janardhanan Sivakumar
HCL Technologies (₹1,023.4)
The stock of HCL Technologies is in a long-term uptrend. After a medium-term corrective decline, the stock took support at around ₹710 in early 2016 and resumed its uptrend that has been in place since 2009.








 
Since mid-2016, the stock has been in an intermediate-term uptrend. However, a key long-term resistance in the ₹,1050-1,080 band limited the stock's rally this April. The stock found support at ₹880 in early June and is once again trending up. It now faces a significant resistance zone ahead is poised at a crucial level.
A conclusive upward breakthrough of the key resistance zone will strengthen the primary uptrend and take the stock higher to ₹1,130 and ₹1,200 levels in the long run.
However, failure to move beyond the key resistance zone will keep the stock consolidating sideways in a wide range between ₹880 and ₹1,080 for a while. Key supports to note within this range are pegged at ₹965 and ₹920. As long as the stock trades above ₹880, the intermediate-term uptrend will remain intact and investors with a medium-term perspective can stay invested with a stop-loss at ₹870. Vital supports below ₹800 are at ₹740 and ₹700.
Investors with a long-term horizon can stay invested with a stop-loss at ₹790 levels. Short-term trend is up. But to strengthen it, the stock needs to move beyond ₹1,050 and ₹1,080 levels for a short-term price target of ₹1,110.
I have bought VA Tech Wabag at ₹ 510. Should I hold or exit?
TVS Prakash Rao
VA Tech Wabag (₹382.7): Since recording a new high at ₹970 in early 2015, the stock has been in a long-term downtrend. In June 2017, it encountered a key resistance at ₹750 and resumed its downtrend. Since then, the stock has been in an intermediate-term downtrend.








 
While trending down, it had decisively breached key supports at ₹550 and ₹450. Nevertheless, it found support at ₹340 in July and has been in a corrective up-move. Recently, the stock breached its 21- and 50-day moving averages and hovers well above them. The stock faces key resistances ahead at ₹400 and ₹450. A strong break-out of these resistances is required to alter the medium-term downtrend and take the stock northwards to ₹500 and ₹550 levels over the medium term.
An emphatic break above ₹550 will alter the intermediate-term downtrend and take the stock higher to ₹600 and to ₹650 levels in the long term. Investors with a long-term perspective can stay invested with a stop-loss at ₹300. You can consider averaging the stock at lower levels with a stop-loss at ₹330 and stay invested for the long term.
Key supports below ₹340 are at ₹320 and ₹300. That said, a conclusive plunge below ₹300 will reinforce the downtrend and drag the stock lower to ₹260 and ₹240 levels.

HCL Technologies (HCL) will acquire select IBM software products for $1.8 billion. The transaction is expected to close by mid-2019 after regulatory approvals.

Even after the full payment is made over the next 12-18 months, HCL would have a comfortable net cash position.




Even after the full payment is made over the next 12-18 months, HCL would have a comfortable net cash position.


 A decade after it purchased UK-based Axon, HCL Technologies (HCL) has bought seven products from global technology major IBM. However, concerns of high deal valuation and the need to take on debt have knocked the stock down by around 5 per cent in Friday’s trade.
The company will pay about $1.8 billion for the seven products, of which HCL has an ongoing IP partnership for five. About 48 per cent of the total cash consideration is payable by mid-2019 and the balance about a year later.
According to reports, HCL expects an annual revenue run-rate of $650 million from the products deal, though the amount is likely to be slightly lower in the first year due to transition issues. Thus, the company is paying more than 2.7 times expected annual revenue from these products as consideration, which may not be inexpensive. But margins are likely to increase after this deal.
HCL has indicated that it would fund the deal by taking $300 million in debt, mainly because some its funds are locked up in FDs and long-term bonds that it has chosen not to liquidate. The fresh debt should not be a major financial burden for the company, as it has almost $1.6 billion in funds (as cash, FDs, available-for-sale securities etc.) as of September 2018 and borrowings of $424 million.
On the whole, even after the full payment is made over the next 12-18 months, HCL would have a comfortable net cash position.
The products deal is expected to augment HCL’s mode-3 (products and platforms) offerings, which accounted for 11.9 per cent of revenues (September 2018) and enjoy an EBIT margin of 24.4 per cent, much higher than the overall firm’s 19.5-20 per cent levels. These products from IBM reportedly enjoy better margins than HCL’s other service lines. Over the next couple of years, it is likely that HCL’s EBIT margins should receive a boost from these products.
Given that the company managed to integrate Axon well and drive growth, these new products too are most likely to provide synergies and scale for HCL.
The markets may have overreacted because of the perception that HCL is overpaying for IBM’s products.
But given the growth trajectory of the company – it is likely to record double-digit dollar revenue growth for FY19 – and very high valuation comfort with reference to its stock, the negativity is likely to fade out quickly."
24,2018-12-07,HCL,"Tackling the product-services conundrum
 
HCL Technologies’ $1.8-billion acquisition of certain IBM software assets is expected to be a stormy affair if the lessons from the past are any indication.
For instance, in 2016, TCS was asked to pay $940 million by a US court for the alleged theft of code by its executives from a customer.
While the fine was later halved, the case was a stark reminder for the Indian IT industry about the importance of putting a wall between the product and the services teams.
TCS now has a separate products division called Digitate, which works independently of the company’s services line and does not even have the company’s logo on its web site.
Apart from possible regulatory backlash, empirically too software and service businesses have not always worked well together. For example, HP acquired Autonomy for $10 billion and later had to split it into four units. Even the hardware and the services business haven’t worked well together, and companies such as Dell, Xerox and HP which acquired the services business of Perot, ACS and EDS, respectively, had to sell them off.
“Competing with their own IT or engineering customers will be a challenge,” said Pareekh Jain, independent IT outsourcing advisor. “They will have to build a Chinese wall between the products and services organisation. HCL will have to be careful about this, both in perception and reality,” Jain said.
Jain argues that product and services are different businesses and no one has got it right at scale except for IBM. But even IBM is now divesting some of these businesses.
“These are dead assets and it makes no sense to invest money in these assets,” said Sanchit Gogia, CEO at GreyHound Research, talking about the IBM assets being bought by HCL Technologies. “For this amount, they could’ve bought a mid-mized ERP company with decent revenues. This is a short-term gain for a long-term loss. This is not an IP asset built for future,” Gogia said. However, analysts agree that building IP is the future for IT services companies but these IPs need to be built to support the services business through building platforms rather than independent products.








 
While HCL expects over $650 million in additional revenues from this acquisition, it needs to remember that customers bought these tools for the IBM brand and perhaps because their relationship may involve using other IBM products as well. Once the IBM brand is taken away and the contracts go for renewals, HCL is set to face a challenge.
“There will be a lot of investments that’ll go into building these products further and putting some of them on the cloud,” Gogia said. “These products have never been sold independently by IBM, and if HCL wants to do that, it’ll be a tough one to crack.”
Yet, analysts believe that HCL can turn these assets around in its favour if the strategy is executed right.
“It is a bold strategic move by HCL and differentiates it from other Indian IT service providers. It’s a risky move for sure, and success will lie in execution. But if successful, the gains could be bigger too,” Jain said."

HCL Technologies (Accumulate)
CMP: ₹941.55
Target: ₹962
HCL Technologies surprised the street announcing an intent to acquire IBM IP products (7 Software Products) for a consideration of $1,775 million (including earn out). The acquired products would have revenues of $625 million in the first year of acquisition and $650 million revenues in the second year for acquisition. This implies HCL Tech is valuing the acquired business at P/S of 2.8x.
As on 2QFY19, HCL Technologies has a goodwill and intangible assets (which includes Licensed IPR) of $2.5 billion ($1.3 billion goodwill and $1.2 billion intangible assets). Post the new deal, the total goodwill and intangible asset on balance sheet would be about $4.3 billion on balance sheet. Owing to the huge intangible asset and goodwill created in the balance sheet, substantial moderation of net cash position on balance sheet and strain on free cash flow trajectory, we trim multiples for the stock. 
We now value HCL Tech at 13x September 20E EPS (vs 14.5x September 20E EPS earlier) which yields a TP of ₹1,100/share. This represents a 13 per cent downgrade in target price led by P/E multiple downgrade. 
Downgrade stock to Accumulate (versus ‘buy’ earlier). Owing to shift in business strategy (large products business along with traditional IT services business) which we assume would be new to Indian investors, stock might languish in the medium term. Cheap valuations (11.7x FY20E EPS) and steady yield (dividend + buyback combined yield at 3.7 per cent a year) might restrict downside."

IT services company HCL Technologies said it has inked a new five-year contract with asset management firm Aegon for its digital transformation.
“The application services deal will see HCL continue as Aegon’s digital transformation partner, helping to accelerate innovation by establishing and managing a new multi-vendor ecosystem,” HCL Tech said in a regulatory filing.
The statement, however, did not divulge the size of the contract.
“HCL will also help implement an agile delivery model to reduce Aegon’s time to market and introduce greater efficiencies through improved application life cycle management and automation,” the statement added.
HCL has been a strategic IT services partner to Aegon Netherlands since 2004. During that time, it delivered application services and partnered in transforming Aegon’s data and analytics capabilities.
The Hague-based company, which serves about 29 million customers and employs over 28,000 people worldwide, wants digital scale up to improve customer self service and cement its position in the market. Aegon is also into multinational life insurance and pensions.
“Our business strategy is centred on digital-first, which is paramount to our ability to drive service innovation, attract new customers and to drive efficiencies, Anke Schlichting, CTO (chief technology officer) at Aegon said.
HCL Tech made headlines last week as it announced to acquire select IBM software products for over Rs 12,700 crore in an all-cash deal, marking the largest purchase by an Indian IT services company till date."
21,2018-12-21,HCL,"HCL trust gives ₹60 lakh for lesser-known species 
Three organisations working on wildlife conservation in Nagaland, Andaman & Nicobar and in the Western Ghats on Thursday won grants worth ₹60 lakh from The Habitats Trust (THT) for their work to protect lesser-known indigenous species and lesser-known habitats.
The Habitats Trust (THT), is founded by Roshni Nadar Malhotra, CEO of the $8.1-billion HCL Corporation.
The Foundation of Ecological Security in Nagaland, which works on protecting endangered and threatened species in the north-eastern State, got the ₹25-lakh Strategic Partnership Grant.
Mumbai-based ReefWatch Marine Conservation bagged the Lesser-known Habitats Grant of ₹15 lakh for its work to restore coral reefs in Chidiyatapu in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands.
The third grant — the Lesser-known Species Grant of ₹10 lakh — went to the Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra, which strives for the protection of the Indian pangolin with community participation in the Western Ghats.
“These grants are aimed at appreciating the work being done by organisations and individuals and giving them support so that they continue the great work,” Roshini, who founded the Trust with her husband Shikhar Malhotra in August, told BusinessLine.
There are so many social issues in India and it is understandable that much of the funding goes to support these causes, with very little of funds from corporates coming to nature and wildlife, she said.
“These natural habitats not just support the known and unknown species of flora and fauna, but these pristine forests are also the biggest source of water. So, by protecting these natural habitats we are protecting ourselves,” she said.
Be it the floods that ravaged Kedarnath a few years ago or the recent devastating deluge in Kerala, the reason is the widespread destruction that “we have been causing to the natural habitat”.
She added that within the conservation space, much of the attention and funds are cornered by tigers and elephants and the Trust would work towards correcting this.
“There are so many lesser known species that get completely ignored. And, there are some wonderful people who are doing amazing work with these small species,” she said.
Malhotra said that when the applications were opened, they were surprised to receive about 700 applications.
With the help of a jury well-versed in wildlife conservation and audit partner Grant Thornton, THT shortlisted three applicants for each of the three categories.
The Trust also rewarded other finalists with 10 per cent of the grant money in each category.
The Trust plans to work with national parks in Uttar Pradesh.
“We already do a lot of work in areas of education, health and livelihood, so environment is only a natural extension of our work,” said Malhotra, referring to the work being done by other foundations supported by HCL Corporation, such as the Shiv Nadar Foundation and the HCL Foundation.
“Most of the work we do in Uttar Pradesh, as HCL is one of the largest private employers in the State,” she said."

18,2019-02-03,HCL,"HCL Technologies: Good show
 
The stock of HCL Technologies (HCL) was up over 5 per cent last week, as markets cheered the better-than-expected financials delivered by the company.
In the December quarter, HCL’s revenues grew by 4.9 per cent Q-o-Q (5.6 per cent in constant currency) in dollar terms, the highest among top-tier IT players. The company’s operating margins were relatively stable at 19.6 per cent for the third quarter.
Geographically, all the regions reported double-digit growth on Y-o-Y basis, indicating broad-based traction. Client additions were also healthy for HCL. At 86.6 per cent, the company’s utilisation rate is among the highest in the industry. One point of concern for HCL is the rise in attrition, which is at 17.8 per cent currently.








 
The stock still trades at a discount to other peers. On a trailing basis, the price-earnings multiple for HCL is 16 times. Peers such as Wipro, Infosys and TCS trade at 17-21 times. If the consistent show from HCL continues, it may well bridge the gap in valuations soon."

Robust growth in HCL Technology’s European business and in some of its important verticals such as public services helped it post a 2 per cent growth in revenue to ₹15,990 crore in the March 2019 quarter as compared with the December 2018 quarter. 
Though the revenue growth in constant currency terms was 3.3 per cent, that did not translate into an increase in the quarter’s profit that fell 1.7 per cent sequentially to ₹2,568 crore. Increase in employee-related expenses and outsourcing costs ate into the company’s operating profit that shrank 1.5 per cent to ₹3,039 crore in the sequential quarters.
For the financial year 2018-19, the company’s revenue rose by 19.5 per cent to ₹60,427 crore while net profit rose by 15.3 per cent to ₹10,123 crore. The company’s revenue growth in constant currency terms was 11.8 per cent in FY19, beating the top end of its guidance.
Operating margin for the year at 19.5 per cent was within the guided range. In FY20, the management expects a 14-16 per cent revenue growth on a constant currency basis, and operating margin between 18.5 per cent and 19.5 per cent.
During the March 2019 quarter, while revenue from the European business grew 8.4 per cent sequentially, growth in the Americas business was nearly flat at 1.1 per cent; the rest of the world grew about 4 per cent.

The scrip, after a weak opening, further dropped 5 per cent to Rs 1,074.45 on the BSE. At the NSE, shares plunged 5.61 per cent to Rs 1,072.80.
The scrip was the worst hit among the front-line companies on both indices during morning trade.

9,2019-05-26,HCL,"HCL Technologies: Well-guided
As a top-tier IT service player that has consistently grown faster than the industry and, yet available at a reasonable valuation, HCL Technologies is an attractive bet for long-term investors.
Despite growing consistently at double-digits in dollar terms — it displaced Wipro to become the third-largest IT player in India in FY19 — over the past several years, the stock is at a discount to peers in the space.
HCL Tech now trades at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 14 times, which is below that of most of its peers like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro (16-25 times). This discount makes it a solid proposition for investors with a two-year horizon.
Robust traction in five of its seven verticals of operation, large-sized client additions and a good show in metrics such as utilisation are positives for the company. In FY19, HCL Tech’s revenue grew at a robust 11.8 per cent over the previous fiscal in dollar terms, which was higher than almost all top-tier peers and the industry as well. The company’s EBIT margin has remained stable at around 19.5 per cent.
In FY19, verticals such as technology and services, retail & CPG, life sciences and telecom grew at 16.8-30.7 per cent over the previous fiscal. This growth suggests broad-based traction across segments.








 
For the full financial year 2018-19, the net profit rose 15.3 per cent to 10,123 crore Y-o-Y, while revenue rose 19.5 per cent to ₹60,427 crore. HCL Tech’s earnings before interest and tax margins came in at 19.5 per cent. The company managed to beat its guidance for revenue, and margins were within the guided range.
Three years ago, HCL Tech announced a strategic blueprint called Mode-1,2 and 3. Mode 1 includes traditional services-related businesses such as infrastructure management services, application services and BPO services. Mostly its core services offering, Mode 2 comprises cloud and security services and digital services. Mode 3 is HCL Tech’s effort to build products and platforms to create its own ecosystem of products and includes its intellectual property partnerships for products of other companies.
At the end of FY19, Mode 1 makes up 71.6 per cent of its total revenue, while Mode 2 and 3 together make up 28.4 per cent. Three years ago, the proportion of revenues was 81.4 per cent and 18.6 per cent for Mode 1, and Mode 2-3 together, respectively.
Mode 2 and 3 are high-growth businesses that earn HCL Tech higher margins. The increased investments in new growth opportunities have weighed on margins.
In FY19, in three out of four quarters, the company bagged the highest deals for a quarter, showing a decent deal pipeline. During the year, the company added two customers in the $100-million contract value category, four in the $50-million bucket, four in the $40-million band and 13 in the $10-million zone.








 
The utilisation rate for HCL Tech is quite healthy at over 85 per cent, among the highest in the industry. Attrition, after increasing in the previous quarters, is showing signs of stabilising, though, at over 17 per cent, it is still a concern.
HCL Tech’s 2019-20 revenue growth guidance is 14-16 per cent in constant currency terms, while margins are expected to be in the 18.5-19.5 per cent range, lower than that of FY19.
The company expects to take a hit in its margins during the Q1FY20 due to process-related expenses for IBM product acquisitions.
In December 2018, HCL Tech announced the purchase of seven of IBM’s products for nearly $1.8 billion. It already had intellectual partnership with IBM for five out of seven of these products. The company expects to rejuvenate these product lines and use them as an entry point to push its other products and services to existing customers.
This deal is expected to be completed by end- May 2019. HCL Tech expects an additional $650 million in revenue from the second year. The incremental annual revenue in FY20 is expected to be $625 million. This deal, the company expects, will add 15 per cent to its earnings per share.
Inorganic growth in revenues (from companies HCL Tech has acquired) helps the company post industry leading revenue growth. The dependence on acquisitions to push revenue growth would mean each acquisition must add to the top-line growth from the get-go. If the new businesses acquired falter, then revenue growth might be hit.
Then comes the risk from the current US-China trade war. This could lead to clients curtailing their IT spends. Foreign currency fluctuations can curtail its ability to meet the guided numbers. This includes headwinds due to uncertainty on Brexit."

HCL Technologies’ net profit came in 13.5 per cent lower sequentially in the June 2019 quarter at ₹2,220 crore due to higher employee costs and higher depreciation expenses due to a change in accounting for leases.
The company’s mainstay Americas region helped it report 4.2 per cent revenue growth in constant currency terms when both Europe and the rest of the world saw tepid growth during the quarter. Revenue in dollar terms came in at $2.36 billion.
Most of the revenue growth came from the manufacturing vertical, which grew by 18.4 per cent during the quarter, followed by technology and services (5 per cent) and life sciences and healthcare (2.4 per cent).
HCL Technologies added two $100-million clients during the quarter in an otherwise moderate deal-booking period. In three out of four quarters of 2018-19, HCL Technologies booked the highest number of deals in its history. Hence, there seems to be a decent revenue pipeline baked in due to the record number of deals booked in 2018-19.
The margins for the June quarter came under the company’s guided range of 18.5-19.5 per cent for 2019-20 at 17.1 per cent due to investments for future projects made by the company, and an 8.9 per cent rise in consolidated employee costs. The margin for the previous March quarter was at 19 per cent.
The point to note here is that the yearly hikes to employees will only kick in from July 1. So, the hike in employee costs pushed to Q2 2019-20 could impact margins later. On the whole, the company has hiked salaries by 6-7 per cent for offshore employees and 3.4 per cent for onshore employees.
The IBM deal was completed on July 1, hence there was no revenue impact of the same in the June quarter. The company expects to book $600 million in revenue over the next 12 months from this deal, which is expected to net at least 50 per cent in margins. As a result of this, the company has retained its margin and revenue growth guidance (14-16 per cent) for the year.
The company managed to curtail attrition during the quarter at 17.3 per cent compared to 17.7 per cent in the March quarter. There is some hiring of freshers that the company plans to complete in the July-September quarter. It has recruited some of the 12,000 freshers it plans to hire during 2019-20."

2,2019-10-24,HCL,"Q2 earnings: HCL Tech ups FY20 revenue guidance buoyed by IBM products contribution
 HCL Technologies posted good results for the quarter ended September 2019, helped by healthy growth in revenues from its engineering and R&D services and products and platforms segments. The acquisition of the IBM suite of products, which was concluded during the period, also aided the performance in the September quarter.
Consolidated net profit rose 19.4 per cent ₹2,651 crore sequentially in the quarter ended September, while revenues grew 6.7 per cent to ₹17,528 crore. The company had earlier stated that the IBM deal would earn it $600 million in revenues over a 12-month period from deal closure (July 1, 2019). The company expectsIBM products acquired to rake in almost 50 per cent EBIT margins. In terms of segments, the company’s engineering and R&D services saw revenues grow by 5.4 per cent sequentially, while the products and platforms segment’s revenues rose by nearly 57 per cent, boosted by the IBM deal. IT and business services saw muted sequential growth at about 1 per cent.
Its standalone products subsidiary, incorporated during the quarter, posted healthy $100 million in revenues the first quarter of operations. During the quarter, HCL Tech posted EBIT margins of 20 per cent (helped by IBM products) well above its 2019-20 guided range of 18.5-19.5 per cent.
HCL Technologies upped its constant currency annual revenue growth guidance to 15-17 per cent for 2019-20 from 14-16 per cent. This was due to an expected bump up in revenue from its acquisition of IBM’s suite of products that was announced in December 2018. HCL Technologies closed the deal in the quarter ended September and started recognizing revenues from the products it acquired.
However, it maintained margin guidance for FY20 at 18.5 – 19.5 per cent. For the six-month period, HCL Tech’s margins came in at 18.56 per cent.
Its mainstay Americas geography saw slowing revenue growth (0.1 per cent QoQ). Europe and rest of the world geographies offset the slack growing 17.1 per cent and 24.4 per cent (sequentially), respectively. The IBM deal helped the growth in revenues from Europe and rest of the world.
The company’s management is optimistic about the future performance of European region, despite its peers (TCS, Infosys and Wipro) witnessing some weakness in client spends."

0,﻿2019-11-24,HCL,"The outlook for Indian IT companies
For the past few quarters, some of the large- and mid-tier IT services companies have been growing at a fair clip and bagging large deals. Digital deals have started to form a larger part of their revenues while core services for most large- and mid-sized players have seen tepid growth; most of the information-technology services companies’ revenue growth was supported by digital.
But the global economic slowdown and the US-China trade war have had a direct impact on many Indian IT services companies. Except for HCL Technologies, which has increased its revenue guidance (Infosys upped the lower-end of its revenue guidance), most Indian IT services companies have cut their FY20 guidances.
With the first half of FY2019-20 behind us and the global headwinds beginning to hit, let’s take a look at the IT services companies investors can bet on. But before we do that, it’s important to look at the levers pulling these companies in different directions.
One segment where client spends are slowing for almost all IT services providers is banking and financial services. Clients are delaying operationalising some deals that were signed in previous quarters. This is especially true of large banking deals in Europe and capital markets- related projects in the US.
While this slowdown might be transient in nature, it allows investors to take a peek at what the clients are thinking about the future prospects of the economy, and as an extension, its impact on IT services companies. Some mid-tier companies that have been growing at a faster pace than their larger peers, have been impacted by large clients delaying spends to achieve cost savings.
With respect to specific verticals, Infosys, TCS and Wipro saw weakness in client spends in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) which led to slower revenue growth in the quarter ended September 30. In the US, capital- market clients, in particular, are putting the brakes on the spends. But digital projects seem to be providing some succour to most players in this vertical.
Another vertical where revenue slowed in the quarter ended September 30 was manufacturing. The revenue growth of Tech Mahindra, Wipro and HCL Technologies slowed in this segment. Retail clients, such as large-format department stores, of the two largest IT services companies — Infosys and TCS — are holding back their spending, which has led revenues to slow sequentially in the September quarter.
Among the mid-sized IT companies, L&T Infotech has seen its banking and financial services vertical’s revenues slowing for the past three quarters. The segment makes up for nearly 27 per cent of the firm’s total revenues.
The company’s group peer L&T Technology Services’ revenues from the telecom and hi-tech verticals have been slowing for three consecutive quarters (its makes up for over 20 per cent of the firm’s revenues).
The retail, consumer packaged goods and manufacturing verticals of Mindtree, which is also part of the L&T Group now, posted a tepid growth for three consecutive quarters.
In terms of geographies, except for Infosys and HCL Technologies, growth in revenues from Europe seems to have slowed in the past few quarters for the large Indian IT players. The macro challenges in continental Europe — with its largest economy Germany slowing — have taken a toll. While TCS’ revenues from Europe have slowed, it’s tepid growth in North American revenues seems to have surprised investors — revenues from North America grew a mere 0.6 per cent during the September quarter to around $2.8 billion.
Wipro’s European revenues have been hemmed in for the past four consecutive quarters mainly because large banks have been delaying spends due to the uncertain economic environment. Revenue growth from Europe during the quarter was muted. However, the company’s North America revenues bounced back after a tepid June quarter.
Muted growth in its manufacturing vertical impacted Tech Mahindra’s Europe revenues. This in turn was impacted by the macro headwinds being faced in Europe, as the EU economy is slowing down in face of the US-China trade war. The firm’s European revenue growth also took a hit because of cross- currency headwinds.
However, after a couple of quarters of tepid growth, Americas helped Tech Mahindra grow in the September quarter — revenue from Americas grew 5.2 per cent to $ 624 million.
Infosys’ European revenues grew, helped by its acquisition of Stater (mortgage services provider) earlier this year, while HCL Technologies’ growth was helped in part by its acquisition of IBM suite of products, which it completed in the quarter ended September. HCL Technologies’ North America revenues were flat in the September quarter, growing just 0.1 per cent sequentially to $1.6 billion. Infosys posted a decent sequential revenue growth of 2.2 per cent in its North America revenues.








 
On the margin front, the September quarter was always going to be a tough one for IT players with pay hikes being doled out to employees. However, among the top IT companies, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra managed to increase their margins sequentially. A rise in sub-contracting costs for TCS led to margins falling quarter-on- quarter.
In the mid-sized IT space, Mindtree and Mphasis managed to better their September quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins compared with the June quarter. Hexaware Technologies, L&T twins (Infotech and Technology Services), among others, saw their margins shrink during the quarter. Most of these companies reported a fall in margins on a year-on-year basis due to a mix of rising sub-contracting costs and adoption of new lease accounting standards that led to higher amortisation expenses being recognised on the books.








 
Also, pay hikes doled out during the first half of 2019-20 impacted margins on a y-o-y basis. Both large- and mid-sized companies have hired a large number of freshers for future projects. Till the projects come on stream and the newly hired are aligned to those projects, there could be an impact on margins due to lower employee utilisation.
There have been news reports that many IT companies, including Infosys, are looking to cut the flab in their mid-level employee hierarchy. If so, it could help improve margins. The point to note here is that the quarter ending December usually sees many employees in the US take off on furlough, which could also shrink margins a bit (this has an impact on revenue as well).
Infosys’ attrition levels have been above 20 per cent for three consecutive quarters now. In the quarter ended June (seasonally higher attrition), the number had spiked to 23.4 per cent. The management has assured that it would try to curb the runaway attrition rate of employees.
Higher attrition pulls down margins as companies have to hire from outside the company to meet short-term demands for talent. This also leads to an increase in sub-contracting costs. TCS’ attrition is one of the lowest in the industry and has been hovering at 11.2-11.6 per cent over the past four quarters. The company is training its employees in digital technologies and has been busy hiring people to meet its future needs when projects come on stream.










Wipro has managed to bring down its attrition to 17 per cent, from nearly 17.9 per cent in the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Tech Mahindra’s attrition has stayed constant at 21 per cent for four consecutive quarters — it’s one of the highest in the industry, just below Infosys. The company’s sub-contracting costs have been rising for five consecutive quarters — it rose 12.2 per cent sequentially in September.
Among the mid-sized IT companies, the hostile takeover of Mindtree by Larsen and Toubro caused disruption and saw many senior employees leave. This can be seen in the steady rise of Mindtree’s attrition rate, from 13 per cent in September 2018 to 16.5 per cent in September 2019. The hope is that now with the takeover complete, the management would tackle this spike in attrition as it could impact margins going forward.
Hexaware has managed to bring down its attrition rate to 17.3 per cent. It had been hovering at 18.2 per cent for the past two quarters. L&T Infotech has seen its attrition spike in the September 2019 quarter to a 12-quarter high of 18.4 per cent, while its group peer L&T Technology Services has seen its September quarter attrition come in at a seven-quarter low of 13.4 per cent.
The deal pipeline of most IT companies does reduce some of the pessimism about their prospects. But most of the pessimism has already been built into the stock prices.
Of the large IT companies that declared the value of deals signed in the September quarter, TCS bagged $6.4 billion, Infosys $2.8 billion and Tech Mahindra its highest ever quarterly deals of $490 million.
Among the mid-sized firms that declared the value of the deals they bagged in the September quarter, L&T Infotech won deals worth $ 100 million, Mindtree $307 million and Hexaware won net-new deals of $36 million (excluding renewals). The point to note here is that these deals — many of which relate to digital transformation — are a necessity. The clients might postpone the spends in face of uncertainty and macro headwinds, but these deals are eventually essential to the clients’ businesses as they will improve efficiency of operations. As an when the deals ramp up, there will be an increase in revenue visibility.
 
The BSE IT index has had its ups and downs over the past 12 months despite rising 10.6 per cent over the period. Compared with their respective three-year trailing price-to-earnings (PE) multiples, HCL Technologies, Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra and L&T Infotech are all trading at a higher 12-month trailing PE multiple. But Wipro, Mindtree, L&T Technology Services, Hexaware Technologies and Mphasis’ 12-month trailing PE are below their three-year average PE.
While picking stocks to invest in the IT sector, it is important to note the cash flow conversion of the companies and the amount of cash these companies return to investors. A high dividend- yielding company, such as TCS, despite being more expensive than its peers, is any day better than one that has lower conversion of profits into cash.
That’s one of the reasons why TCS trades at such a premium to rest of the pack. HCL Technologies, despite its double-digit revenue growth, is valued at a discount to TCS. One of the reasons is the lower conversion of profits to operational cash flow.
TCS’ diverse capability to implement projects in various domains also helps it stand out, but its revenue growth expectations have come a cropper in 2019-20 due to a tepid first half. However, even though we don’t have a call on TCS, it’s still a good bet for investors because of its high payout ratio (80-100 per cent of free cashflows.) This is what keeps its price elevated compared with its peers.
HCL Technologies is also a good pick because it has managed to organically grow in double digits even with macro headwinds, and has upgraded its revenue guidance after the first half of 2019-20. Investors can consider buying TCS and HCL Technologies in the large-cap space and L&T Infotech and Mphasis in the mid-cap space."
