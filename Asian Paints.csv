Asian Paints sees growth in the healthy and eco-friendly paints category with concerns about pollution increasing among consumers.
Speaking to mediapersons during the launch of ‘Vanna Kolangal’ style guide for the Pongal festival in Chennai on Friday, Amit Syngle, Chief Operations Officer, said the market for eco-friendly paints market is becoming big, as consumers are becoming more conscious of the environment and rising pollution, especially expectant mothers.


Products


 The company has launched Royal Atmos, which absorbs pollution, and has range of products in the pipeline to add to this category, such as anti-bacterial and anti-radiation paint. These products cost ₹450 per litre, which is almost three times that of the basic variety. But with increasing disposable income and rising awareness, the company is seeing customers and businesses such as hotels going in for such products.
The company also plans to create paints that have been inspired by rangoli, bharathanatyam and the temples of Tamil Nadu.
“We are looking at the concept of regionalisation as ‘one size fits all’ is not applicable for a country like India,” said Syngle."

What is the long-term outlook for Asian Paints and Pidilite Industries?




Sudhin




Asian Paints (₹1,214.5): The stock of Asian Paints jumped almost 4 per cent with good volume on Friday, breaching a key medium-term resistance at ₹1,170 levels. The rally has taken the stock's weekly gains to almost 7 per cent.
The stock is in an uptrend across all time-frames — long, medium and short term. Since taking support at ₹850 in December 2016, the stock has been in an intermediate-term uptrend. After four months of sideways movement, the stock resumed its uptrend last week. It trades well above its 21- and 50-day moving averages. However, it now tests a key resistance band between ₹1,200 and ₹1,230.
Strong break above this barrier will push the stock into the uncharted area, so that it can touch higher levels. The stock can trend upwards to ₹1,300 levels in the short-to-medium term. Envisaging a move beyond ₹1,300 levels needs to be reviewed after that.
Investors with a long-term perspective can continue to hold the stock with a stop-loss at ₹950 levels. Make use of declines to accumulate the stock.
Significant supports to note are placed at ₹1,170 and ₹1,100. Strong fall below ₹1,100 can find support at ₹1,050 levels.


Pidilite Industries (₹843.1): The stock of Pidilite Industries is also in an uptrend across all time-frames — long, medium and short term. Last week, the stock climbed 1.8 per cent, witnessing bullish momentum. It has recorded a new high of ₹849 on Friday.
The stock trades well above its 21- and 50-day moving averages. Nevertheless, the stock can experience selling pressure at higher levels and test resistance at ₹850 levels.
The weekly indicators and oscillators are displaying signs of weakness. A downward reversal from the key resistance band between ₹830 and ₹850 can pull the stock down to ₹800 and ₹780 levels.
The stock has been in an intermediate-term uptrend since taking support at ₹578 in December 2016. This uptrend will remain in place as long as the stock trades above ₹675 levels.
Investors with a long-term view can remain invested with a stop-loss at ₹650 levels. Key supports to note below ₹780 are at ₹750 and ₹700 levels

PT Asian Paints Indonesia, its indirect subsidiary, has commenced production with a capacity of 5,000 tpa on single shift basis. PT API was incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berger International Private Limited, Singapore. The plant has a capacity of 24,550 tpa in Indonesia. None of the promoters/directors or key managerial persons have direct or indirect interest in the transaction, the company said. Investors will closely monitor the development."
30,2018-01-23,Asian Paints,"A steady quarter for Asian Paints
Asian Paints, one of the largest paint makers, is on the path to recovery post the implementation of GST in July 2017. Though revenue has remained flat for the December quarter 2017, on a (GST) comparable basis, the company reported revenue growth of about 11 per cent year-on-year to Rs 4,268 crore. Profit for the same period grew about 16 per cent year-on-year to Rs 567 crore.
The key segment of the company – decorative paints -- has registered single digit volume growth as demand conditions for the paint industry have not reached pre-GST levels. On the industrial front, automotive coatings witnessed good growth in the auto OEM, auto refinish and general industrial business segment. The company also reported good growth in powder coatings, leading to an overall good performance in industrial business. Overall, paint demand in the North and East has been good for the company, whereas in South it has not been good due to an extended monsoon.
The company is the largest player in the decorative segment which contributes 83 per cent of its revenue, while industrial coatings and home improvement business contributes 2 per cent each; the rest of the revenue, about 13 per cent, is contributed from the international business. Operating margins improved to 22 per cent in the December quarter, slightly higher than 21 per cent of the same period last year.
Raw material costs have increased nearly 14 per cent year-on-year for the quarter ended in December 2017, due mainly to an increase in the price of crude and titanium-di-oxide, key raw materials for the paint companies. The company has not taken any price hike in the December quarter although with the increase in raw material prices, the company might take price revisions going forward.
Considering the dependency on raw materials, the company is strongly moving towards water-based solvents, which would reduce the cost of raw materials such as crude or titanium-di-oxide to a greater extent in the coming years. For FY19, the company has outlined capex of Rs 1,000 crore for setting up two new plants, which will produce entirely water-based paints."
29,2018-05-11,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints hits 52-week high
 Shares of Asian Paints today surged nearly 6 per cent as the company has a reported 3.39 per cent increase in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
The stock gained 5.95 per cent to Rs 1,287 - its 52-week high - on the BSE. On the NSE, the stock jumped 5.77 per cent to hit a one-year high of Rs 1,288. Asian Paints was the biggest gainer on both the Sensex and Nifty during the morning trade.
Asian Paints had on Thursday reported 3.39 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 495.91 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 against a net profit of Rs 479.61 crore in the January-March quarter a year ago.
The company has reported a total income of Rs 4,531.52 crore in the fourth quarter against Rs 4,442.25 crore in the corresponding period a year ago, Asian Paints had said in a BSE filing."
28,2018-05-11,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints: Strong growth momentum 
The stock of Asian Paints has gone up about 6 per cent on the back of a strong quarterly performance. Healthy growth in decorative and industrial paints segment has kept the company’s March quarter performance in good stead.
The company has reported a revenue growth (excluding excise duty) of 14 per cent y-o-y to Rs 4,492 crore in the fourth quarter of FY18. With improved demand conditions, the decorative paints segment registered a double-digit volume growth in the recent March quarter.
According to the management, good growth was witnessed in adhesive, wall paper and water proofing segments as well. The company reported a profit growth of 4.2 per cent y-o-y.
Asian Paints is one of the largest players in the country having worldwide operations. The company is the market leader in decorative segment which contributes over 75 per cent of its revenue.
The company is largely dependent on crude-based raw materials such as titanium di oxide. Though increase in crude prices is a cause for concern, the company being a market leader, is able to mitigate the risk by increasing prices.
The company’s operating margin improved to 20 per cent in the recent quarter. It increased by 2 percentage points from the year-ago period. Asian Paints has effected about 1.4 per cent price increase with effect from March 1, 2018 and a further 2 per cent price increase across all its products, with effect from May 1, 2018.
Going ahead, the prediction of normal monsoon augurs well for the company. Continued focus on network expansion would help improve its sales. Construction of two new manufacturing plants in Vizag and Mysuru are progressing as per schedule which would provide additional capacity. The company currently has a total capacity of 1.1 million kilolitres."

In the March quarter, with improved demand conditions, the decorative paints segment registered double-digit volume growth.








 
The company’s operating margin also improved to 20 per cent in the recent quarter, up by 2 percentage points from the year ago period. Though the steady increase in prices of raw materials has put pressure on the margin, the company was able to mitigate the challenge by taking price hikes. The company has effected about 2 per cent price increase across all its products, with effect from May 1, 2018. It reported profit growth of 4.2 per cent y-o-y."

Asian Paints (Hold)
CMP: ₹1,263.75
Target: ₹1,310
FY18 was no doubt a challenging year for Asian Paints as it had to contend with high input costs inflation and tax rates (unlike consumer staples, GST did not result in any saving for the Paints industry). 
On BS side, the company incurred huge capex on greenfield factories and acquisitions. The combination of above resulted in a 620 bps compression in ROIC (30.1 per cent versus 36.2 per cent in FY17) of which 290 bps was on account of gestating assets. Interestingly, the efficiencies that Asian Paints consistently displayed in managing its overheads until FY12 returned to help constrict operating margin decline to mere 67 bps in FY18 versus 220 bps decline in gross margin. Net cash position was down ₹830 crore on account of the huge capex spends that will up capacity by over 50 per cent by end-FY19E, and cost of acquisition of Sri Lanka’s Causeway Paints. 
Operating CF generation growth has, however been strong (+38.4 per cent) due to a negligible increase in working capital; FCFF, though, was down 18 per cent due to capex spends mentioned earlier. The company’s ability to sustain the recent recovery in volume growth to double-digit level would be key for the stock to sustain its premium valuation (51x NTM EPS) — we expect earnings to accelerate to c.20 per cent CAGR over FY18-20E versus 11.7 per cent over FY15-18."

 Asian Paints is embarking on its largest capacity expansion this fiscal year, investing Rs 4,000 crore at its Visakhapatnam and Mysuru facilities to add 1.1 million kilo litre to its present output.
 The city-headquartered company is setting up plant with a 5 lakh KL per annum capacity at Visakhapatnam at an investment of Rs 1,785 crore and a 6 lakh KL plant at Mysuru pumping in Rs 2,300 crore.
“We are in the midst of our largest capacity expansion. In the first phase, two mega plants with initial capacities of 3,00,000 KL per annum each of water-based paints would be commissioned at Mysuru and Visakhapatnam in FY19,” Asian Paints managing director & chief executive KBS Anand said in the annual report.
 Asain Paints, which is the domestic market leader, operates in 16 countries and have 25 manufacturing facilities globally, catering to consumers in over 60 countries. 
Its industrial coatings business was badly affected in the second half of FY18 due to GST as well rising input costs. But launch of industrial tinting machines in the dealer networks, and the success of its direct-to metal coatings, it could not only retain market share but in fact increase it in the second half of FY18, Anand said.
 In the automotive paints segment, the company added Ford and Hyundai during the year. It could also gain market in share in the two-wheeler space.
 However, Anand said international business did not perform well. While a weak economy and a highly deflated currency hit its Egyptian operations, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka also did not do well. But higher sales in Nepal, Oman and Bahrain could contain some the impact of the poor show by the above markets.
 He said the greenfield operations in Indonesia as well as acquisition of Causeway Paints in Sri Lanka have increased its global revenue. Having completely existed the low growth Caribbean markets, Asian Paints is now focusing on expanding its portfolio into the emerging markets of Asia and Africa, chairman Ashwin Choksi said. 
He further said the uncertainty is likely to continue in the current financial year as well, citing the general elections and a slew of assembly polls. “While the economy gradually absorbs the impact of GST, impending elections across many states and the general elections will add to the instability, Choksi said."

23,2018-07-24,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints Q1 net rises 30%, sees stable growth 
With improved demand , Asian Paints reported solid earnings growth during the first quarter of FY19. 
Healthy growth in the decorative and industrial segments meant that the company’s June quarter numbers were ahead of market expectations.
The company has retained its leadership in the decorative segment, which contributes over 75 per cent of its revenue.
 In the June period, Asian Paints’ revenue increased 15 per cent (net of excise) y-o-y to ₹4,398 crore, while net profit rose 30 per cent YoY to ₹571 crore from ₹441 crore last year.
The core segment, decorative paints, registered double-digit volume growth due to greater traction in the affordable housing category. 
On the industrial front, the automotive coatings segment witnessed good growth due to the robust performance in the two-wheeler and commercial vehicles segments. The cost of raw material (largely crude derivatives) for the company (as a percentage of sales) increased to 55 per cent with the continued increase in crude oil prices.
Price hike
 To cushion its margins, Asian Paints took a price hike of 1.9 per cent in May. The operating margin improved to 20 per cent in the recent quarter, an increase of two percentage points YoY. 
Asian Paints had taken a 1.4 per cent price increase across its products in March 2018.
Going ahead, the prediction of normal monsoon augurs well for the company.
 The GST rate reduction to 18 per cent from 28 per cent is also likely to help the company’s earnings in the coming quarters. 
However, the continuous increase in raw materials prices may dampen the margins. 
The construction of two new manufacturing plants in Visakhapatnam and Mysuru are progressing as per schedule and are likely to be operational in September 2018 and January (2019)."
22,2018-07-25,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints hits record high as Q1 profit beats estimates
 Shares of Asian Paints today hit a record high as Q1 profit beats street estimates. Shares of India's biggest paint maker by market capitalisation rose as much as 1.6 per cent to a record high of Rs 1,490.60.
The company had on Tuesday reported a 31 per cent growth in Q1 profit, beating street estimates.
CLSA analysts say: “Asian Paints GST rate cut improves growth outlook for the company as the organised industry should benefit and gains from lower GST would be instantly passed on, but there are near-term concerns on margins, as product price hike may be difficult.’’
CLSA has raised EPS estimate by 3-4 per cent to factor in better margins. It has cut the rating to “outperform” from “buy”, but raised the price target to Rs 1,600 from Rs 1,460.
“While in near term there may be some pressure on margins due to inflationary pressures and delayed price hikes, we believe that strong operating leverage and some recovery in units and JVs will offset these,’’ Jefferies analysts say.
The brokerage has raised the estimates for FY20 by 6 per cent factoring in better volume recovery on the back of recent rate cuts, market share gains, and some margin improvement. It has raised the price target to Rs 1,650 from Rs 1,385, and retained “buy” rating.
Asian Paints stock had gone up 26.7 per cent this year as of last close. About 17 of 32 brokerages have rated the stock “buy” or higher, 12 “hold” and 3 “sell” or lower; their median price target is Rs 1,400, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data."
21,2018-08-21,Asian Paints,"The picture gets brighter
Paint companies have shown solid performance in the recent June quarter, despite an increase in the cost of raw materials. Companies such as Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac have taken sustained efforts to pass on the higher costs to customers, thus cushioning their margins. This move, along with improved market conditions, has contributed to revenue and profit growth. Most companies recorded double-digit volume and value growth, particularly in the decorative and industrial segments.
Demand growth
The demand for paints has been growing steadily, thanks to the Centre’s push towards affordable housing and normalisation of GST. Similarly, the industrial segment too witnessed good growth due to robust performance in the two-wheeler and commercial vehicles markets.
In this regard, Asian Paints’ overall revenue rose 15 per cent Y-o-Y (net of excise duty) in the June quarter. The company has retained its leadership position in the decorative segment, which contributes nearly 75 per cent of its revenue. The company reported double-digit volume growth in this segment.








 
Similarly, Kansai Nerolac too has reported double-digit volume and value growth in its core segments — decorative and industrial. The company derives about 55 per cent of its revenue from the decorative segment and 45 per cent from the industrial segment. Strong recovery in both segments has helped the company register 17 per cent Y-o-Y (net of excise duty) increase in revenue. Profits, though, dipped marginally by 0.7 per cent Y-o-Y.
Following the same trail, Berger Paints and Akzo Nobel’s revenues grew 21 per cent and 10 per cent Y-o-Y respectively in the first quarter of FY19.
The reduction in GST rates to 18 per cent from 28 per cent is likely to increase demand levels for paint-makers in the coming quarters.
Price hike
Volatility in crude prices can impact the margins of paint companies, since most of their raw materials such as titanium di oxide, zinc oxide are crude derivatives. Most leading paint companies in India are able to cushion their margins by passing on the cost increase.
Asian Paints, for instance, reported a14 per cent Y-o-Y increase in raw material cost in the June quarter; raw material cost as a percentage of sales stood at 55 per cent. It took a price hike of 1.9 per cent this May. The company’s operating margin improved to 20 per cent Y-o-Y in the recent quarter, an increase of two percentage points over the same period last year. Asian Paints had already taken a 1.4 per cent price hike across its products in March 2018. The company’s net profit grew 30 per cent Y-o-Y in the June quarter.
The margin of another leading paint maker, Kansai Nerolac, was impacted due to rising crude prices. The raw material cost (as a percentage of sales) increased sharply to 59 per cent in the first quarter of FY19 compared with 55 per cent the same period last year. Despite the company’s efforts to pass on cost increases to customers, the margins declined by 2 percentage points to 16 per cent during the June quarter. Profit dipped 1 per cent Y-o-Y.
Operating margins of Akzo Nobel and Berger Paints remained more or less stable in the June quarter compared to the same period last year. Berger Paints registered a profit growth of 19 per cent, while Akzo Nobel reported single-digit profit growth of 9 per cent in the June quarter.
The continued increase in the crude prices is likely to put pressure on the margins of paint makers in the coming quarters. Further, other factors such as trade war and rupee volatility are likely to impact the earnings of these companies."

CMP: 1,227.9
Target: ₹1,471
Asian Paints is India’s leading paint company and Asia’s third largest paint company, with a group turnover of ₹169 billion. Asian Paints operates in 16 countries and has 25 paint manufacturing facilities in the world. 
In its latest financial results, Asian Paints has reported a growth of 15.1 per cnet in revenues at ₹43,903 million in Q1-FY19 as against ₹38,152 million in Q1-FY18. The growth was mainly on back of growth in decorative business led by both volume and 1.9 per cent price increase effected in May 2018.
In terms of growth, we continue to expect Indian paints industry to grow at around 8-12 per cent in the next few years and demand factors remain strong in terms of growth, concerns remain in terms of raw material costs mainly on account crude oil which we believe is gradually declining due to increase in share of water based paints going ahead.
We believe Asian Paints is better placed to capture incremental growth in the industry on back of its strong distribution network, cost efficient operations, better brand positioning amongst others."
19,2018-10-16,Asian Paints,"No rosy picture: Rising input cost forces paint makers to hike prices 
Abhishek Law 
Paint-makers have hiked prices by 2.5-3 per cent since the beginning of this month. This is the second time prices have gone up in the decorative paints category this fiscal, and the third during the calendar year. Earlier hikes of around 2 per cent each were initiated in March and May.
Rising input cost, particularly, driven by northward movement of crude prices and falling rupee are said to be the reasons for the hike.
Compared to the decorative segment, price hike across the industrial paints sector could be a bit steeper, at around 6-7 per cent. But, it will be the first hike in the category during this fiscal.
All major paint companies, including market leader Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac and Akzo Nobel, are said to have revised prices.
While Berger Paints confirmed the move, others did not respond to queries and calls by BusinessLine.
According to Abhijit Roy, MD and CEO, Berger Paints, an upward revision in price had to be initiated in order to ease margin pressure. Roy is also the President of the Indian Paints Association, an umbrella organisation of paint-making companies.
“Decorative paints have seen a 2-3 per cent price hike beginning October, while in the industrial segment it will be around 6-7 per cent,” he said.
On a year-on-year basis, the price of the key input, titanium dioxide, saw a 6 per cent increase in the second quarter, while price of monomers have also increased, say market sources. As Roy points out, the chemical is imported and hence the rupee depreciation has an impact on cost.
This apart, majority of the raw materials used by paint companies are crude oil derivatives like pthalic anhydride and others (including monomers). These have seen “quite an increase” in prices with crude prices moving up.
“From Q3 onwards, we expect margin pressures to ease. Ideally, margins should be around the 15-18 per cent levels for paint companies,” he said.
Despite the upward revision in prices during the festival season, demand is unlikely to be hit, Roy said. 
Paint companies had in July, cut prices by 10 per cent to pass on the benefit of the reduced GST (Goods and Services Tax) rate on paints. (GST rates were reduced from 28 to 18 per cent earlier this year.)
“There was a 10 per cent price cut that happened post GST rate changes in July. Now only a 2-3 per cent increase is done over that reduced price. So, prices remain on the lower side and we do not see much of an impact in volume sales,” he explained."
18,2018-10-23,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints: Rise in crude prices dent Q2 performance 
The stock of Asian Paints, one of the top paint makers in the country, fell 5 per cent on Tuesday following its weaker than expected results for the September 2018 quarter. Similar to the experience of other paint makers, including Kansai Nerolac, the rise in raw material (crude derivatives) costs weighed on the company’s profits.
Raw material costs as a percentage of sales increased sharply to 56 per cent in the September quarter, compared with 47 per cent in the same quarter last year. This increase was not only because of higher crude oil prices but also due to weaker rupee.
To negate the input cost pressure, Asian Paints increased the selling price in decorative segments. However, it didn’t helpsave the profit margin. The company saw operating profit margin shrink by two percentage points to 18 per cent in in the September quarter. Kansai Nerolac had reported a decline of 4 percentage points in operating margin to 16 per cent.
Asian Paints registered a double-digit volume growth in its core segment – decorative paints, despite a price increase of 3.4 per cent. Decorative segment contributes nearly 75 per cent of the company’s revenue. On the industrial front, automotive coatings, protective and powder coatings segment too did well.
Sales growth was reported at 9 per cent, y-o-y. However, increased price pressure pulled the profits down by 15 per cent.
The coming quarters are likely to be challenging for Asian paints. The management expects higher crude prices and depreciating rupee to continue to weigh on performance. Uncertainties arising from a busy election period and less than estimated rainfall in the monsoon season, may add to the pressure."
17,2018-10-30,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints: Less colourful Q2
The stock of the country’s largest paint maker – Asian Paints – declined about 4 per cent following its quarterly earnings. The steady increase in raw material costs has impacted its margins.
The continued increase in crude oil prices has resulted in spiking the cost of one of its key raw materials, titanium dioxide, which is a crude derivative.
The raw material costs, as a percentage of sales, have increased sharply to 56 per cent this quarter, compared to 47 per cent last year.
This rise is not only because of an increase in crude prices but also due to rupee volatility. To negate the input cost pressure, the company increased the selling price in decorative segment by 2.35 per cent in the beginning of October.
The operating margin was down by 2 percentage points to 18 per cent in the September quarter. The company’s profit fell about 15 per cent y-o-y to ₹506 crore."

Target: ₹1,530
Asian Paints is the largest paint company in India and figures among the top 10 players in the world. The company has 25 manufacturing plants in 17 countries, serving consumers in 65 countries globally. 
Investment rationale: a) Asian Paints’ standalone sales grew 8.7 per cent y-o-y primarily due to a volume surge of 11 per cent y-o-y. This is despite of 3-3.5 per cent price hikes, therby, reflecting unfavourable product mix.
b) With Brent crude trading below $60 per barrel, it will lead to decline in the raw material costs which in turn will lead to expansion in gross margins. Lower crude prices have turned the entire negative sentiments of margins contraction which was earlier projected to absolute positive sentiments for the next couple of quarters.
Outlook and valuations: Asian Paints’ decorative paint segment has been doing good and with lower crude prices will aid to margins expansion. Also, with the hike in MSP prices, urban development, farm loan waivers we expect rural disposable income to increase which will further aid demand. The stock is currently trading at 587x FY20 E PE and looking at the lower crude prices and rising disposable income from the rural and urban areas, we would like to allot a PE multiple of 65x to arrive at a target price of ₹1,530 a share."

Tata Elxsi (₹961.6): After a sharp fall in September and early October 2018, the stock of Tata Elxsi found support at ₹950 in late October.
The stock has been on a sideways consolidation phase in the band between ₹950 and ₹1,100 since then. It currently tests a key support as well as the lower boundary at ₹950. The medium-term trend is down for the stock.
A strong fall below ₹950 will strengthen the downtrend and drag the stock down to ₹900 and then to ₹850 in the short to medium term.
 








 
Key resistances are placed at ₹1,000 and ₹1,100. A strong break above ₹1,250 is needed to alter the medium-term downtrend and take the stock higher to ₹1,350 and ₹1,400 levels.

13,2019-01-22,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints: Volumes improve, but increase in input costs take the sheen off earnings 
The December quarter performance of Asian Paints, one of the largest paint makers in the industry, outpaced industry estimates. Strong volume growth in the decorative and industrial coatings segment led to a robust growth in revenues. The company’s revenue grew 24 per cent y-o-y to ₹5,294 crore in the latest December quarter. However, the operating margins remained under pressure due to high raw materials cost. The net profit grew 14 per cent y-o-y to ₹647 crore in the latest quarter over the same period last year.
The core segment – decorative – registered a high double-digit volume growth across regions. This segment contributes to nearly 75 per cent of the company’s revenue.
Since the price of crude increased significantly during the December quarter, the company’s raw material (a form of crude derivative) cost also went up. To offset the input cost pressure, the company increased its prices by 2.35 per cent in October and 1.75 per cent in December. However, the burden of price increase was mitigated to some extent as the company was able to pass on the benefits of the GST (Goods and Service Tax) rate reduction (from 28 per cent to 18 per cent) to its customers.
In the industrial paints segment, automotive coatings witnessed good growth in the general industrial category but the auto OEM segment saw a subdued growth on the back of weakness in the underlying sector. Other categories of industrial paints – powder and protective coatings – though registered good growth. Raw material cost as a percentage of sales came down to 50 per cent in the December quarter, compared to 56 per cent in the previous September quarter. Though crude prices have offered some respite in the last few months, raw material costs are still elevated. Therefore, the price increases by the company have not been enough to offset the rise in input costs entirely. 
The operating margin was down by 1 percentage point to 20 per cent in the December quarter compared to the same period last year."

 Paints major Asian Paints has reported a subdued growth in its profits at Rs 636 crore, up 14 per cent, during the quarter ending December 31, 2018 due to higher input and raw material costs. The company’s profit in the corresponding period at ₹544 crore, a 24 per cent increase from the previous period. 
The company’s consolidated revenue during the October-December quarter grew by 24 per cent at ₹5,294 crore compared to ₹4269 crore a year-ago as the decorative business segment witnessed a double digit volume growth.
“The decorative business segment in the country registered a double digit volume growth and delivered strong performance across regions. The automotive coatings witnessed subdued growth in the while the Industrial Coatings JV(AP-PPG) continued to witness good growth in the protective coatings – dealer segment and the powder segment. Margins remained under pressure on account of the higher raw material prices,” said KBS Anand, Managing Director & CEO, Asian Paints.
Naveen Kulkarni, Head of Research, Reliance securities said that while the results were significantly better than expectations on back of solid volume growth.
“Domestic volume growth ~21% for 3QFY19 on festive season demand, putty sales, kerala uptick and market share gains. The gross margin has declined due to commodity inflation, however it is expected to reverse in coming quarters on back of price hikes and benign input costs,”he added.
The international business saw one more quarter of subdued performance owing to forex unavailability and high RM costs and poor macroeconomic conditions. Industrial paints) saw healthy growth while the automotive coatings saw subdued growth due to weak auto sales during the quarter."

We re-initiate coverage on Asian Paints with a ‘Buy’ recommendation.
It reported a stellar performance in the third quarter of FY19 driven by nearly 20 per cent volume growth, which is the highest since FY11. Notably, the management continues to see strong volume traction in decorative paints segment across categories.
Though near-term headwind in the form of General Elections could pose some challenges, Asian Paint’s long-term themes of un-organised to organised conversion and premiumisation continue to remain intact.
Asian Paint’s capacity addition in FY19 is 0.6 million KL/year, which translates into a capacity enhancement of 53 per cent, which is quite significant. Further, its operating cost and depreciation expenses significantly increased in the third quarter with operation of the Mysuru plant, which added 3,00,000 KL/year capacity in September 2018. We value the stock at 45x FY21-E earnings, which implies 11 per cent upside from the current levels.
Asian Paint’s international segment delivered a sluggish performance in FY19 owing to challenges in countries such as Sri Lanka, Egypt & Bangladesh, as it does not enjoy market leadership to exercise pricing power. Ethiopia is witnessing raw material challenges because of lack of forex availability. Though its domestic automotive segment is seeing sluggish growth, industrial segment is seeing good traction."

Shares of Asian Paints, one of the largest paint-makers in the industry, fell nearly 2 per cent on Thursday due to disappointing March quarter results. The company’s net profit declined 2 per cent to ₹487 crore compared to the corresponding quarter the previous year, though revenue growth registered a healthy 12 per cent.
High input costs and volatility in rupee made operating margin contract by 2 percentage points to about 16 per cent.
The company’s raw material cost as a percentage of sales has increased to 53 per cent in March quarter from 51 per cent in the previous quarter of last year. With significant increase in crude prices, especially since December 2018, the company’s raw material (which is a form of crude derivatives) cost increased sharply. To offset the input cost pressure, the company has taken various price hikes through FY19 — the latest being 1.7-per cent price hike in the month of December 2018. But the price increases by the company have not been enough to offset the rise in input costs entirely.
Though Asian Paints reported a double-digit volume growth in its core paint segment — decorative business, the contribution of low-end products such as putty appears to have been higher in this segment, depressing realisations. 
In the industrial paints segment, automotive coatings, including powder and protective coating, witnessed good growth. However, the auto OEM segment saw a subdued growth on the back of slowdown in the underlying sector.
Given that there is a consumption slowdown in the industry, the demand for products such as paints could be subdued going ahead, if there is no revival. In addition, volatility in crude prices and further depreciation in the Indian rupee could mount pressure on input costs of the company. 
With lack of demand, price hikes to protect margins would be difficult."

Asian paints’ (APNT), is the market leader in the Indian paint manufacturing industry with a market share of about 53 per cent. Q4FY19 revenue grew by 12 per cent year-on-year (below estimate) aided by double digit volume growth about 10 per cent. However, inferior product mix, trade discounts and higher employee cost led to decline in EBITDA margin by 230bps year-on-year to 16.4 per cent.
While higher depreciation (42 per cent year-on-year) and interest cost (68 per cent year-on-year) dragged earnings to a de-growth of –2 per cent year-on-year.
Volume growth is likely to stabilise at double digit but inferior mix and increase in overhead cost on account of commissioning of new plant will impact margins.
We reduce FY20E/21E earnings estimate by 10 per cent/8 per cent, respectively. However high valuation and weak demand outlook will be a near term challenge. We therefore revise our rating to ‘Reduce’ and value at a P/E of 40x on FY21E EPS."

Achieving a 50 per cent increase in capacity in 2-2.5 years’ time is by itself no mean feat; doing so while keeping ROCE/ROE (return on capital employed/return on equity) almost intact is quite a different achievement altogether, in our view. Asian Paints’ post-tax ROCE of 21.3 per cent is nearly the same as prior year’s 21.6 per cent in FY19 despite the commissioning of two large greenfield factories that added 51 per cent to its capacity-base that now stands at 1.7 million KL a year versus 1.1 million KL.
 The company’s net-cash balance still rose by ₹330 crore in FY19, though the same is ₹230 crore lower cf. FY16-end level when activities on the two new plants commenced. FCFF grew 53 per cent in FY19 — helped more by lower capex spends, though, as growth in cashf low from operations was just 4.8 per cent due to increased working capital investments made during the year.
