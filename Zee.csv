The media and entertainment industry is set to grow well in the coming years due to the changing consumption pattern, increasing penetration of television and digital media and higher surplus income with consumers. Zee Entertainment Enterprises’ (Zee) stock stands to benefit from this trend.
The stock has already been moving up sharply over the last five years, backed by strong growth in advertisement revenue from the popularity of Zee’s channels and content, and healthy business operations. The pending implementation of TRAI’s tariff order regulation is viewed as a concern for the industry as it could hamper subscription revenue growth.
But with Zee’s channels already leaders in various segments, the company is expected to benefit from higher transparency, and reduced revenue leakage resulting from the implementation of this order.
Investors with a long-term perspective can therefore buy this stock. The valuation of the company, while not cheap, is reasonable. Zee currently trades at ₹589, at a multiple of 40 times its twelve-month trailing earnings, slightly below its three-year average PE multiple of 45 times.


Nearly 57 per cent of Zee’s revenue is generated from domestic advertisements, which has grown at a healthy pace in recent quarters, despite GST-linked slowdown in various sectors. Domestic subscription accounts for 28 per cent, international subscription 7 per cent with other segments accounting for 8 per cent of the revenue. Zee also has a small presence in movie production and distribution, digital broadcasting and live events.
Advertisement revenue has recorded annual average growth of about 16 per cent between FY14 and FY17, subscription revenue grew at about 8 per cent.
Advertising growth is driven by the fact that Zee’s channels are well entrenched across genres and in various Indian languages. The network enjoys leadership in domestic broadcasting. It improved its market share to 18.3 per cent in the second quarter of FY18, up from 17 per cent in the previous quarter. Zee Cinema now holds about 30 per cent viewership in the Hindi movie segment, behind Sony Cinema. Zee Marathi is the market leader with 61 per cent viewership and Zee Bangla enjoys 35 per cent, trailing Star Jalsha that enjoys 60 per cent share. The popularity of some weekday shows such as Kumkum Bhagya, Kundali Bhagya in Zee TV and Mazhya Bavryachi Bayko in Zee Marathi has been attracting advertisers.
The Zee network, which currently produces about 500 hours of original content every week, has lined up to deliver better content in the coming months. The Zee TV channel is expected to increase original content to 30 hours a week in the next quarter from 27.5 hours currently. It further plans to increase original content to 32 hours per week by the end of FY18. All this will help in adding to subscription growth.
The company also has a presence in niche channels such as Zee Café and Zee Studio, delivering international content. Zee also broadcasts in regions such as Europe, the US and APAC.




With the digitisation of cable television yet to be completed in certain areas, the company stands to benefit from addition of subscribers. This, along with the implementation of TRAI’s tariff order, will have a positive impact. According to this order, broadcasters are required to offer their channels on a la carte basis, where Maximum Retail Price (MRP), excluding tax, for each pay channel should be disclosed.
However, for the half-year ending September 2017, subscription revenue declined 12 per cent year-on-year, mainly due to the delay in contract renewal negotiations with the operators owing to pending implementation of the tariff order regulation. This order, once implemented, will help improve subscription revenue as customers get to pick and choose instead of paying for a bouquet of channels. As Zee has significant market share in various regions, it will gain through the implementation of this order, which is under dispute in court.
In its movie segment, Zee holds one of the largest collections of movies and has acquired several movie and music rights in the last one year. It also intends to make 10-12 movies a year gradually. Zee’s theatrical revenue increased from ₹55 crore in FY16 to ₹112 crore in FY17.
With the acquisition of 9X Media last October for ₹160 crore, Zee will be adding six music channels to enjoy leading market share in the respective languages.




Zee has a presence in the digital space through its digital platform, ditto tv and OZEE. The company is set to combine both OZEE and ditto tv to launch Z5, offering a larger content catalogue to customers. Digital advertising is expected to grow at an annual average of 31 per cent from 2016 to 2021, as per the latest KPMG India-FICCI report.
However, the monetisation from its digital platform will take time as the OTT (over the top) — where content is delivered over the internet without an operator — platform is crowded with players such as YouTube, Facebook, Hotstar, Voot, and telecom companies and distribution platform owners such as Tata Sky.
Though the company plans to offer newer and differentiated content, the success and sustenance of the platform will have to be watched. This is evident from its digital (OZEE) video views, which registered over 75 million views as of March 2016 but only recorded 60 million monthly views during March 2017. The alliances with telecom players such as Airtel, Vodafone and Idea for integration of these applications should help grow its digital customer and advertisement base.




Zee’s consolidated revenue and adjusted profit grew at an annual average of 28.4 per cent and 29.6 per cent, respectively, over the five years from FY12 to FY17. Advertisement and subscription revenue grew 9 per cent and 10 per cent year-on-year, respectively, in FY17.
While revenue declined 4.4 per cent to ₹3,122 crore in the six months to September 2017, compared to the same period last year, adjusted profit grew about 65 per cent to ₹752 crore for the same period on improved operating efficiency and jump in other income. Revaluation of shares held in India Web Portal and Fly by Wire International Web Portal resulted in increasing other income. Operating margin improved to 29 per cent for the six months to September 2017, compared to 23 per cent in the six months to September 2016. The company’s debt-equity ratio is under 0.3 times, giving enough head-room for expansion.

84,2018-01-08,Zee,"Zee Tamizh to focus on women-centric original content
Tamil general entertainment channel Zee Tamizh is undergoing a brand refresh to be relevant to changing consumer preferences and attract a larger audience with original content. It will be launched on Monday.
In an interaction with BusinessLine, Siju Prabhakaran, Cluster Head – South Business, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, said the revamp will see content with more women-centric characters, reality shows that run for a shorter duration and better movie offerings. The channel recently acquired rights for Vijay-starrer Mersal and Rajinikanth’s 2.0.
The transformation, says Prabhakaran, is a result of a major shift the Tamil entertainment channels witnessed in the past two years.
The Tamil entertainment industry accounts for about ₹2,000 crore and is one of the largest regional players in the country. It is also a priority market for advertising for many retailers. But the kind of prime-time shows that were popular few years have undergone a change in the last two years, says Prabhakaran .


No more stereotyped ones


A decade ago most of the serials tended to take a conservative approach and stereotyped women. There were not many choices available for audience as well. But in the last two years, original content offered by the channels increased with strong women characters, who resonate with the current generation, says Prabhakaran.
In a market study the company carried out recently, it was found that women-centric serials and series that do not drag on for years tend to attract viewership. It also found that viewers look for variety more often as they lose interest on reality shows that run for months together. Movie offerings, too, play a significant role in attracting viewers as it garners significant viewership during weekends.


Spike in market share


The channel has been experimenting with new shows and serials in the past year and has seen its market share increase from less than 5 per cent to 15 per cent. “We want to increase our audience base further,” says Prabhakaran.
“To do that the brand refresh will take into account changing consumer needs and shows are designed-based on that,” he added.
To attract Tamil audiences overseas, the company also plans to strengthen its OTT (over-the-top) platform. The company is working on bringing more original content to the OTT-platform by the year-end. According to Prabhakaran, Tamil OTT platforms have a strong market in the US, Canada and Asia-Pacific region, where there is a significant Tamil population. “Going forward, those are the markets we want to strengthen,” he added."
80,2018-01-09,Zee,"Zee TV launches Dance India Dance merchandise

Deepak Rajadhyaksha, Deputy Business Head - Zee TV said, “The show also serves as a source of inspiration for the huge audience base who have watched it and its various franchises. Introducing specially branded DID merchandise is a conscious attempt to foster this unique bond that the audience shares DID cementing it with a more emotional connect.”"
81,2018-01-09,Zee,"Zee Entertainment jumps over 4%
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd rose as much as 4.2 per cent to Rs 563, its highest since October 13, 2016.
Macquarie Research says there is an upside risk to its margin estimates of 31.5 per cent in FY19 and FY20. It adds that advertisement growth for H2 of FY18 will grow in mid-teens.

A still from Amir Khan-starrer Dangal


Zee Entertainment Enterprise is looking to make content accessible to the visually and hearing impaired. To start with the company said it will telecast the Amir Khan-starrer Dangal with audio description.
Zee has the telecast rights for Dangal. Zee’s Hindi movie channel - Zee Cinema SD - will premiere the blockbuster. The film, which moved audiences in India and across the world, will also have subtitles for hearing impaired audiences.
“Zee Cinema will be the first movie channel in India to premiere a film curated for the visually impaired. It will also have subtitles for hearing-impaired audiences. We hope that the premiere of Dangal reaches out to the maximum number of such audiences in India. We are also exploring adding audio descriptions in other Indian regional languages in the future,” Punit Misra, CEO - Domestic Broadcast Business, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL), said.
According to the World Health Organisation 2010 Report, India accounts for eight million blind persons, 54.5 million people with low vision and 62.6 million people with visual impairment, which makes India home to the second largest visually challenged population globally.
The objective is to ensure that the large population of the visually and hearing impaired have access to what is truly world class, inspiring entertainment.
Zee Cinema has also associated with the biggest associations for the visually impaired in the country, the National Association For The Blind (Mumbai, Indore, Chandigarh and Lucknow), National Association For The Blind - The Workshop for the Blind in Mumbai, Institution For The Blind in Delhi and the Patiala School of Blind & Deaf in Punjab.
Reaching out to over 109 million viewers each week, Zee Cinema’s premiere of Dangal with Audio Description and subtitles will surely change the accessibility landscape in India. The Audio Description feed will be available on Dish TV, Videocon, Tata Sky and Airtel. The subtitles will be in English language on HD and in Hindi language on SD.
Essentially, Audio Description conveys the most important visual aspects of the story by providing commentary during natural pauses and moments of quiet. It is voice-over narration that explains what’s happening on the screen, including physical actions made by various characters and other important visual elements. The narration is inserted between lines of dialogue. This Audio Description is recorded and made available as a separate audio track that can be selected by the audience on their remote."

Kotak Securities


Zee Entertainment (Sell)
CMP: ₹538.65
Target: ₹506
Zee Entertainment Enterprises is a media and entertainment company engaged in providing broadcasting services. The company operates through Content and Broadcasting segments. It offers content in multiple languages and offers approximately 38 international and over 30 domestic channels. The company has a library.
Zee Entertainment has reported in-line operating financials for Q1FY18. Results were on expected lines, affected adversely by GST roll-out.
Weakness in advertising revenues is likely to spill over to an extent into Q2 FY18 as well. Recent improvement in the ratings of flagship channel Zee TV has led to an appreciation in the stock — we raise our price target to ₹506 (₹470 earlier) in recognition of this.
We note that there is significant likelihood of fresh pressure emerging on ratings (fresh programming initiatives from Colors, Sony); uncertainties relating to the implementation of tariff order persist. Maintain ‘Sell’.

97,2018-01-12,Zee,"Zee Entertainment launches 2 new channels for Africa
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd has announced the launch of two new channels, Zee Bollymovies and Zee Bollynova, which will broadcast on Africa’s new pay-TV network, Kwesé TV.
With the promise of ‘Bollywood Magic’, Zee Bollymovies is set to captivate African audiences across the board with its award-winning Bollywood movies and series.
The channel aims to become the number one destination for Bollywood on the continent, bringing the latest and best Bollywood entertainment to Africa.
The other new addition to the Zee stable, Zee Bollynova, promises to create ‘Memorable Moments’ with its offering of a fusion of general entertainment programming, showcasing the best telenovelas and food shows.
Amit Goenka, CEO – International Broadcast Business, ZEEL said, “With great similarities between the two cultures, Africa has always shown a tremendous appreciation for rich, vibrant Bollywood content. Our two previously launched, specially customised channels, Zee World and Zee Magic, have been warmly received by viewers, resulting in a three-fold increase in our viewership since our entry into the continent in 2015. This love and appreciation for our content has encouraged us to introduce two new channels, Zee Bollymovies and Zee Bollynova”.
Harish Goyal, CEO of Zee TV Africa said, “We have packaged our latest offerings, Zee Bollymovies and Zee Bollynova, with content adapted to suit the African viewer. Both channels are customised and dubbed in English.”
Zee Bollymovies will be a 24-hour dedicated Bollywood movie channel exclusively in English. On the other hand, Zee Bollynova will offer viewers innovative and engaging general entertainment programming.
Zee Africa had earlier launched Zee World in February 2015, followed by Zee Magic in October 2015, which are both premium, fully dubbed English and French channels respectively."
93,2018-01-12,Zee,"Zee moves premium Hindi channel Zindagi to VoD platform OZEE
Adapting to evolving audience preferences, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd has announced the decision to move its premium Hindi entertainment channel Zindagi from the television broadcast platform to its video-on-demand platform OZEE beginning July 1, 2017.
This move has been announced with an objective to expand digital engagement with audiences who thrive on time-shifted viewing. With this, ZEE is focussed on owning the full extent of the consumer’s premium and personal video experience.
The shows that will be available exclusively on OZEE and will include the popular shows Snowdrop, Descendants of the Sun, A Love Story and Total Dreamer. The original productions of Zindagi will also be available on OZEE.
Aparna Bhosle, ZEE’s Business Cluster Head, Premium & FTA GEC channels said, “Today, content for our audiences is not just on television but also includes gaming, short form video clips and user generated content, amongst other forms. There are rapid technological advances that are changing viewing habits and content for our audiences can no longer be managed by a remote control.

78,2018-01-17,Zee,"Zee profit rises 28% to touch ₹322 crore
Healthy growth in advertisement and subscription revenue due to the popularity of Zee Entertainment Enterprise’s channels and content has kept the leading media company’s December quarter results in good stead.


Ad revenue


The advertisement revenue of Zee has rebounded sharply after the GST-led slowdown in the previous quarters, increasing nearly 26 per cent year-on-year in the December quarter of 2017 to ₹1,202 crore.
This segment is mostly driven by the company’s channels, such as Zee Cinema and other General Entertainment Channels (GEC), which have a significant presence in various Indian languages.
Also, the popularity of some of their weekly shows, such as Kum Kum Bhagya, added to their advertisement revenue growth. Nearly 64 per cent of the company’s revenue is generated through advertisement. The subscription revenue for the December quarter increased about 8 per cent year-on-year (adjusted for the sports business that was hived off in March 2017) to ₹404 crore. This is because of the early contract renewals by the company for this quarter. This, along with Zee’s popular content, in channels such as Zee Marathi, Zee Bangla, Zee Telugu and Zee Tamil, has helped it gain viewership during the quarter.
The company has lined-up a healthy pipeline of original content in the coming quarters, too. Though the impending TRAI’s tariff order brings some uncertainty to subscription revenue, Zee stands to gain from the implementation of this order, due to its leadership position across domestic broadcasting segments.
The company’s profit increased about 28 per cent year-on-year for the December quarter 2017 to ₹322 crore. At the operating level, the margins have improved to 33 per cent in December quarter 2017 from 29 per cent in the same period last year. Zee is one of the leading entertainment networks, which had 18.3 per cent viewership share during the December quarter."

Zee Group's DTH arm Dish TV said it intends to go ahead with its merger with rival Videocon D2H.
The merger had received a set back following bankruptcy proceedings against D2H's promoter group by banks. 
Dish, however, said that it had made assessment regarding the possible impact of the merger.
“'Upon evaluation of the above circumstances by the Advisors to the Scheme, the company shall be taking necessary steps for completion of the scheme. In view of the above, we would like to inform you that the company now intends to take further steps for effecting the said merger,'' it said.
The company has appointed two directors to the board of Videocon D2H Ltd to aid the integration of the two businesses.
Earlier this year, Dish TV had said that it was evaluating the impact of insolvency proceedings against the Videocon Group companies.
The State Bank of India took Videocon to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for a loan default of ₹3,900 crore. 
This was followed by a statement by Dish TV that it was relooking at the merger deal.
As a part of the amalgamation, Dish TV and Videcon D2h will file relevant documents with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in the last week of February.
The Ministry had previously given a nod for the merger on December 15."
76,2018-03-09,Zee,"ZEE complains against DEN to I&B Ministry
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd has complained to the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting alleging violation of extant DAS Regulations and breach of licence conditions by DEN Networks Ltd.
In a letter dated February 27, ZEEL has alleged that that DEN is supplying signals in an unencrypted and non-addressable mode in DAS notified areas, which is contrary to the licensing conditions and violation of DAS Regulations.
Piracy of channels
In addition, ZEEL has also submitted video recordings to MIB as an evidence to show that DEN is taking channels from a DTH Set Top Box and re-transmitting the channels through its cable networks in an unencrypted and non-addressable mode. ZEEL has stated that this amounts to piracy of channels which is not only an offence under the Copyright Act, 1957, but also specifically prohibited under the Programme Code as provided in the Cable Television Network Rules, 1994.
The complaint alleged that the actions of DEN are not only adversely impacting the broadcasters but also causing revenue loss to the public exchequer.
“I am surprised to hear this. We haven’t received any notice and in fact recently BECIL (Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited) conducted our audit and gave us a clean chit. Because we have put Zee channels on a-la-carte, they are not happy and coming out with such frivolous cases. We follow the law of the land,"" said  SN Sharma, CEO, DEN Networks, on the allegations made against the company by ZEE Entertainment.
In January, TDSAT had ordered Den Networks Ltd to continue telecasting ZEE channels as per the agreement which expired on December 31, 2017. It also ordered DEN to pay ₹10 crore fine to ZEE.
DEN Networks and ZEE Entertainment were in TDSAT due to non-renewal of their commercial arrangement which expired on December 31, 2017."
75,2018-05-10,Zee,"Zee profit slips to ₹231 cr 
Zee Entertainment’s March quarter results indicate a significant recovery after facing the twin challenges of note-ban and the introduction of the GST last year.
 While revenues increased at a robust pace, profits were disappointing and were below market expectations.
The domestic advertisement revenue grew 24.6 per cent y-o-y (excluding the sports business) to ₹938 crore in March quarter 2018. The company’s strong penetration in regional languages through channels such as Zee Cinema, Zee TV and Zee Marathi along with other GEC (General Entertainment Channels) has helped. The Launch of new shows has further strengthened its position in the regional languages as well. Over 60 per cent of the company’s revenue is generated from advertisement and the popularity of weekly shows such as Kum Kum Bhagya adds to this growth.
Domestic subscription revenue, on the other hand, has increased by 18 per cent y-o-y to ₹452 crore (excluding the sports business) mainly attributed to the early closure of deals with cable/DTH operators. Also, Zee’s content in channels such as Zee Marathi, Zee Bangla and Zee Telugu has witnessed good viewership during the quarter. However, according to the management, the delay in TRAI’s tariff order slightly impacted the subscription revenue growth, despite contract renewals. 
Movie and Music, another lucrative segment for Zee, has witnessed consistent improvement. The company’s movie production division, Zee Studio, released two Marathi movies during the March quarter which was well received at the box office. Zee Music has expanded its music collection and registered about 3.4 billion views on YouTube in the fourth quarter.
However, the company’s profit declined to ₹231 crore in March quarter 2018 from ₹1,515 crore for the same period last year. This fall is mainly due to the increase in operating cost (advertisement and publicity expenses) which grew about 24 per cent y-o-y and increase in programming cost (about 7 per cent y-o-y) in the fourth quarter FY18. Increase in original programming hours in regional channels and increase in content cost for ZEE5 (a mobile application) have driven the increase in expenditure for the company. Thus, to that extent, the margins also declined 2 percentage points to 29 per cent y-o-y."

70,2018-07-18,Zee,"Zee Entertainment puts up a strong show 
 Strong penetration in regional languages and revival of advertisement spends from companies post-GST, has aided the performance of one of the leading media network companies, Zee Entertainment, in the latest June quarter. The company has met market expectations and reported a robust revenue and profit growth of 15 per cent and 31 per cent y-o-y, respectively, in the first quarter of FY19.
Domestic advertisement revenue grew 22 per cent y-o-y to Rs 1,087 crore in the June quarter. Increased ad spends from consumer goods companies has helped. Further, the company’s strong penetration in regional languages through channels such as Zee Cinema, Zee TV and Zee Marathi, along with other GECs (General Entertainment Channels) has also aided ad revenue growth. Nearly 60 per cent of the company’s revenue is generated from advertisements and the popularity of the weekly shows add spunk to the company’s advertisement revenues.
On the domestic subscription front, revenue for the June quarter increased 12 per cent y-o-y to Rs 425 crore. Also, Zee’s content in channels such as Zee Marathi, Zee Bangla, Zee Telugu and Zee Sarthak witnessed good viewership during the quarter, thanks to improved content quality. The audience for Zee Café is increasing, according to the management. The Zee Studio (renamed as &flix) movie channel, too, has increased viewership and has over 400 movies in its library.
Though TRAI’s tariff order (broadcasters are required to offer their channels on an a la carte basis, where Maximum Retail Price, excluding tax, for each pay channel should be disclosed) is a cause for concern, the management is confident of growth from subscriptions going ahead. This new tariff structure is likely to come into effect from January 2019.
Similarly, another lucrative segment – movies and music – continues to make good progress. It has released three movies during the quarter, which was well received in the box-office and one of them was recognised in international film festivals. Zee Music has expanded its music collection and registered about 4.1 billion views on YouTube in the first quarter.
Zee’s programming cost increased to Rs 1,206 crore in the June quarter from Rs 1,056 crore during the same period last year. This is mainly driven by an increase in operating cost (14 per cent y-o-y) and advertisement and publicity expenses (21 per cent y-o-y). An increase in original programming hours in regional channels and an increase in content cost for Zee5 (a mobile application) have driven an increase in expenditure for the company. However, margins have improved 33 per cent y-o-y from 29 per cent last year.
Outlook
Going ahead, the company is planning to launch a new GEC television channel in Malayalam by December 2018 and is awaiting regulatory approval for the same.
The newly launched Zee5, the company’s digital OTT offering (a mobile application) has increased its viewership base. Though the company has not signed any deals with telecom players, the management is confident of subscriber growth with the launch of original content and exclusive movie premiers. In addition, the company has halved the subscription rate till August 15 as part of its promotional strategy. The company plans to launch the app globally by the end of fiscal 2019."

Country’s OTT video segment to enter top 10 largest markets by 2022 with a CAGR of 22.6 per cent


 
As the battle for eyeballs intensifies in the highly-competitive Over The Top (OTT) media industry, ZEE5, a new player in the OTT space, said it will launch over 90 original content in the next 18 months aimed at monetising the growing demand for premium content in the country.
“We have so far released 15 originals across six languages and we are planning to launch 90 plus originals in FY 2019 and reach 150+ digital premiers in the next 18 months,” said Manish Aggarwal, Business Head, ZEE5 India.
Launched by Zee Entertainment Enterprise Limited (ZEEL) in February, ZEE5 is a relatively new entrant to the fray that is facing cut-throat competition in the form of slashing subscription prices and strong content offerings by OTT players such as Netflix and Amazon Prime besides homegrown contestants like Hotstar, Voot, Eros Now, and AltBalaji.
OTT segment
According to PwC’s Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2018-2022, India’s OTT video segment , growing at a CAGR of 22.6 per cent, is poised to enter the top 10 largest markets by 2022. The OTT video revenue, which hit ₹2,019 crore in 2017, is expected to reach ₹5,595 crore by 2022, the report added.
In a marked shift in the content offering, OTT players are investing heavily in creating original contents in local languages focussed on regional audiences and to expand their premium membership base. Original content such as Anurag Kashyap directed Sacred Games on Netflix and Breathe or McMafia on Amazon Prime are some of the popular web series.
On its part, ZEE5 recently launched its second Tamil web series Kallachirippu produced by Kollywood film director Karthick Subbaraj after America Mappillai, released in February. The platform also offers popular Hindi series such as Karenjit Kaur, a web series based on the life of Bollywood star, Sunny Leone; Zero KMS, and Mehmaan.
“The dubbed version of Kallachirippu is attracting viewership from North India and Maharashtra. This only goes on to strengthen our belief that good content appeals to audience universally,” says Aggarwal.
Freemium pricing model
ZEE5 follows a Freemium pricing model that offers both free and premium contents , catering to a mix of audiences. The platform recently premiered latest Bollywood movies such as Padman, Parmanu and Veere Di Wedding on the ‘Theatre ke baad, Pehli baar’ feature, under which the latest movies are screened straight after theatre release and before airing on television.
Aided by a large library of Hindi and regional content across 12 languages available with Zee network of channels, Zee5 is creating originals for digital natives across the country.
According to a Deloitte technology, media and telecommunications report, OTT players are heavily investing in creating and distributing original programmes in Hindi and regional languages.
The report further states that ₹2,500-3,000 crore has been set aside for OTT services in the country especially for original content production."

Bharti Airtel and Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) have joined hands to drive entertainment content on mobile phones. Zee will curate and create video content, including TV shows, original series and movies, exclusively for Airtel TV and its own digital platform, Zee5.
“There are several levels to the partnership. The exclusive piece is the content created and curated by Zee for Airtel.
“While it sits on the Airtel TV App, it plays from the Zee5 API. So, Zee will get access to that subscriber fully – from his profile to the consumption pattern,” Punit Goenka, MD and CEO, ZEEL, told BusinessLine.
Zee will use Airtel’s depth of data to understand consumer statistics and handpick content to suit that demographic. “However, Zee5 and our linear content are not exclusive and will be available for all our partners,” he added.
Revenue deal
Zee will get a fixed per subscriber fee with a backed-up minimum guarantee because of the upfront content investment it will pump in.
On its part, Airtel will bundle Zee5 with its ₹499 data pack under which the consumer will getaccess to the entire content of Zee5, including originals, movies, TV shows, music videos, plays, among others.
Gopal Vittal, MD and CEO (India and South Asia), Bharti Airtel, said: “We want to build a world-class content ecosystem by partnering all players and enabling a differentiated digital entertainment experience for our customers. In Airtel TV, we have built a solid digital platform to curate top content from India and across the world and offer it to customers at one place.”
He said Zee’s content catalogue was vast and varied, and Airtel’s collaboration would help unlock that potential. The partnership will be a win-win for both as it will help Zee ramp up its OTT subscription much faster than it could have done on its own as Airtel commands about a third of the Indian mobile subscriber market. Airtel, in turn, will get access to one of India’s biggest content libraries.
Airtel’s rival Reliance Jio has picked up stakes in Balaji Telefilms (25 per cent) and Eros besides Saavn as it looks to strengthen content offerings in a data-driven market."

Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL), India’s largest listed media company, is taking baby steps in the ultra-competitive world of over-the-top, or OTT, which delivers content on handheld devices using internet. BusinessLine caught up with Zee Entertainment MD Punit Goenka on the company’s OTT strategy and how it will play the catch-up game after a delayed entry into the space. Excerpts:
Why is OTT an important platform for ZEE’s future growth?
There are two angles to it. One, you look at the audience set that is not available on TV... that is being largely addressed by OTT platforms. About 96 per cent of India is still single-TV households. Therefore, not all family members get access to the TV for long duration. And that’s the audience base we can capture through the OTT space. 
Two, in the international market, the traditional form of distribution for TV is becoming very expensive as we have to partner with DTH and cable companies, which take a large piece of the revenue. So, we believe that the OTT strategy for overseas markets will be far better for companies like us.
What kind of investments have you made in your digital platform — ZEE5?
A lion’s share of our investments for the next two-three years will go into the digital space. If we stop investments altogether, we could deliver margins upwards of 35 per cent. We will still invest everything above 30 per cent (in the digital platform).
Zee has been late, compared to the industry, in putting an OTT strategy in place. How do you look at it?
I agree with that view and there is no debate at all, but it is still far from over. While we are definitely a late entrant, we are catching up fast, and being late also gave us an opportunity to learn from others’ mistakes. I think currently our numbers are relatively small given that we are just four months into OTT, but we are growing rapidly month on month and I am very happy with the number of viewers ZEE5 is attracting besides the time spent by users on the platform. We will share details post October.
Indian consumers typically don’t want to pay for content. How will you make adequate returns on your investment?
I don’t believe that the Indian consumer doesn’t want to pay for content. Once we start creating quality content and a critical mass of it, consumers will definitely pay. It may not be that everyone in the country is willing to pay, but there is a large audience base out there which will pay at the price points we are talking about. Someone has to just invest in it.
How will you differentiate yourself in a market crowded with regional, national and international players?
Our content strategy will be the differentiation. There is enough and more content available on ZEE5, which will not be available on other platforms, whether it be originals or other shows. Our movie strategy, where we are premiering movies on ZEE 5 before TV, will stand out. And our language spread will also differentiate us.
Any plan to push more regional content?
We are covering six major Indian languages and creating content in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, and Bengali. Our movie library has nine languages including Bhojpuri and Oriya. And the list is expanding. We are sure that with our vast content portfolio and regional focus, we will be able to make a mark.
How do tie-ups with telecom operators help you?
We are open to tying up with all telecom companies. It benefits us as we can ramp up our subscription on the OTT side much faster than we can do on our own. And, the operators get access to our content, which can be customised for their subscribers. The revenue arrangement benefits both the sides."

Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) on Monday said it will launch multiple bouquets of channels in each language, with the price for Hindi language bouquet expected to start at Rs 45 under the maximum retail price (MRP) regime. The deadline for players to announce the MRP for various channels is August 31.
""All Zee channels will be available on a-la-carte basis as required by the regulations. Consumers will also have the option to choose from specifically created bouquets for Hindi speaking markets and different regional language markets like Marathi, Bangla, Odiya, Bhojpuri, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam,"" the company said in a late evening release.
For other languages, bouquet prices will be higher in those markets where Zee has multiple offerings and lower in other cases. High Definition will be priced higher, with the Hindi ones to be priced upwards of Rs 60.
“For each market, there will be multiple bouquets available to consumers across the country at different price points. Each bouquet would constitute a mix of channels of different genres including general entertainment, movies, news, infotainment and music. The starting bouquet is likely to exclude English entertainment and English movie channels whereas the premium bouquet would include all channels offered by Zee,” the release added.
ZEEL has decided to offer all its news channels along with its other channels like Zee Anmol, Big Ganga and Big Magic as part of these pay bouquets. As a result, these channels would not be available in the FTA pack, it said."

Investments in Zee5 are likely to drag margins in near term with possible break-even only likely by FY25; this could significantly decelerate EBITDA growth and de-rate valuation multiples below long-term historical averages, Morgan Stanley has said.
Zee5 is a video-on-demand website run by Zee Entertainment.
The brokerage believes Zee5 will have to spend disproportionately on high-quality content and distribution costs to drive viewership and compete against large players with both deep pockets and vast video streaming experience.

“In more evolved markets like the UK or the US, where subscribers are already paying for content, we will follow only the paid model. But in countries which are just getting on to the OTT system, like Bangladesh, it makes sense to have an ad-supported version,” he said.
Subscribers will get access to the entire library of content at an introductory offer of $2-10 per month, depending on the region. ZEE5 also offers display personalisation in 11 languages besides voice search, and download-to-watch-offline option. It also has an extensive Live TV offering with more than 60 live TV channels.
Archana Anand, Chief Business Officer, ZEE5 Global, said, “With over 1,00,000 hours of content across genres and languages, ZEE5 is the singular platform that Indians and South Asians have been waiting for. With the launch of ZEE5 globally, we intend owning the India peg and being the go-to destination for Indian content for South Asians and beyond wherever they may be.”"

Zee




Zee


Zee Entertainment’s September quarter results were in line with what the markets expected, with the company reporting a robust growth in revenues, though net profits came in lower due to higher tax outflow and no exceptional items this time around vis-à-vis last year.
Both advertising and subscription revenues expanded at a healthy pace, suggesting that the company has been able to capitalise its leading position in many genres and tap into the consumption theme.
Zee’s app, Zee5, seems to have taken off at a scorching pace, with the company now reporting as many as 41.3 million users, a jump of nearly 190 per cent over the figures of April this year.
The company’s revenues grew 25 per cent y-o-y in the second quarter to ₹1,976 crore. Operating profits (EBITDA) increased by 37.6 per cent, while net profit fell by over 38 per cent to ₹387 crore, as tax expenses increased by over 76 per cent against the same period in the previous year and a ₹134.6 crore exceptional item pertaining to the sale of its sports channels last year.
Domestic advertisement revenue grew 23 per cent y-o-y to ₹1,153 crore in the September 2018 quarter. Apart from its core Zee TV (Hindi) offering, robust viewership across regional channels such as Zee Bangla and Zee Marathi, along with other GEC (general entertainment channels) has helped ensure this growth. The launch of a new channel, Zee Bollywood, and new shows has further strengthened its position in regional languages. Zee5’s (mobile platform) contribution to ad revenue has also helped.
Zee Entertainment derives nearly 61 per cent of its overall revenues from advertisement.
On the domestic subscription front, revenues grew 26 per cent y-o-y to ₹509 crore, mainly attributable to the early closure of deals with cable/DTH operators and increase in viewership of regional channels. In addition, the company is already in discussions with distribution partners for a seamless transition to comply with telecom regulator TRAI’s new tariff order, as and when it is implemented. This will help in subscription growth, given the increase in original content provided by the company.
Other segments of Zee – Movie and Music – have witnessed consistent improvement. Its movie production division, Zee Studio, has released two movies in the September quarter."

Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (ZEEL) has announced its entry into Kerala with the launch of its fifth channel in the southern region, Zee Keralam.
The channel was unveiled by Punit Misra, CEO, ZEEL, Siju Prabhakaran, South Cluster Head, ZEEL, and Deepti Sivan Pillay, Business Head, Zee Keralam, here on Wednesday. 
With 38 domestic channels and 39 international channels under the ZEEL umbrella, the launch of Zee Keralam will consolidate the southern market for the network with a total of five channels.
Siju Prabhakaran said that in the last few years, the south cluster has been growing exponentially for Zee as a network and with the launch of Zee Keralam, the company will continue to perform at a high growth rate. 
Zee Keralam will go on-air in November 2018 with its HD feed with a robust programming calendar that will be a mix of both fiction and non-fiction shows along with an extensive movie library and star-studded events line-up, he said.
The channel is set to launch with an extensive multimedia campaign covering all major districts of Kerala and is targeting complete reach and accessibility throughout all distribution platforms."

Imagine watching a movie where during a blast scene you can feel the heat and the vibrations of the spot besides smelling the burning rubber and dust. Or having your living room filled with the fragrance of flowers as the lead couple sing around them in a garden on screen. All this and more will be possible once Zee Entertainment makes commercial its latest patent on a platform for offering immersive experience to viewers.
Developed in the Silicon Valley at Zee Media Lab, the technology platform is built on 3D audio, augmented reality and virtual reality, digital scent, holograms and touch, to transform the viewers’ living rooms into an immersive mode.
“What our patent does is that we can connect to any of these devices and enhance your content viewing experience. It is an app that sits on your connected box and mobile and provides an experience involving the five senses. We are not getting into the hardware,” Amit Goenka, CEO, Z5 Global told BusinessLine.
The other leg of this offering involves content creators. “For creators, we will provide a tool to convert their content into five senses offering. They can enable their existing content and also create future content on these lines using our tool,” he added.
With the grant of the US patent, Zee can make the platform available to users across the world. The commercially viable prototype will be ready in the next 12 months, Goenka added. This emboldens Zee’s plan to target mainstream global viewers across US, Europe, Asia, China and Latin America. “We will go commercial first with the US, Europe, Japan and China markets,” he said, refusing to divulge pricing details.
“Based on the uptake in these geographies, we will expand to other countries,” Goenka said, not giving any timeline for the India launch, though it will be inevitable given the company’s audience base in the domestic market.
The platform will also enable the viewers to order any product, which they see being consumed or used by on the screen, at the touch of a button. Besides, it will offer a 3D gaming experience and give the players the experience to feel the heat of an ongoing combat with the opponent.
The patent also is a step towards Zee’s ambition of turning a technology company from being only a content company. “In the last three years, the lines have blurred and may disappear soon between content and technology companies. All tech companies have already forayed into content or are planning to. We are looking at technology as our aim is to become a tech company,” Goenka added."

JMFL
Zee Enertainment (Buy)
CMP: ₹442.45
Target: ₹530
Zee management hosted a conference call after announcement by promoter of their intention to sell up to 50 per cent of their equity stake to a strategic partner [SP]. Management categorically stated: 1) they would be looking for technology and global expertise while considering any SP; and 2) they are open to partnership at multiple levels including Zee5, the OTT subsidiary of ZEEL. 
In our view, prospect of a 10-20 per cent stake in ZEEL alone, is unlikely to attract desired SPs, and therefore Zee may also have to offer a significant minority stake or perhaps even a controlling stake (51 per cent) in Zee5 to incentivise the prospective SPs. 
Assuming all-primary deal in subsidiary Zee5 and all-secondary deal in ZEEL, we estimate: 1) Zee5 can potentially raise ₹2,500 crore in return for a 40 per cent stake (post issue) based on a 20 per cent hair-cut to our DCF value [₹3,800 crore pre-money]; and 2) Essel Group can raise ₹4,000 crore by selling 10 per cent in ZEEL at a 5 per cent discount to CMP of ₹438. 
We expect Zee share price to be range-bound in the near-term, given continued overhang from high promoter share-pledge and potentially positive news flow around the strategic review undertaken by Zee promoters. Our December 2019 TP is ₹530 and rating is ‘Buy’."
55,2018-11-18,Zee,"Zee Entertainment: In the right channel - Buy
Zee Entertainment is one of the largest players in the media and entertainment space and among the few companies in the segment that are profitable. The company has pan-India presence and is among the top three players in regional and Hindi markets. Zee also has presence in the international markets such as the US, Europe and West Asia (offering 13 local language channels), though the Indian market is the highest revenue spinner (over 80 per cent).
Ads contribute nearly 60 per cent of the company’s revenue and are expected to grow at a healthy pace. Recovery in ad spends by corporates and the upcoming elections in several large Indian States augur well for ad revenues. The launch of new and original content and expansion into new territories should help the company’s subscription revenue. In addition, Zee’s increasing digital presence through the Zee5 app will also aid its revenue growth.
The stock has corrected more than 20 per cent since this January. At ₹442, it trades at 26 times its likely per share earnings for FY19, a tad expensive compared to peers. Nonetheless, Zee’s prospects remain bright. The company recently announced the promoters’ plan to divest 50 per cent of their stake in the company. While this creates some uncertainty in the near term, bringing in a strategic partner that can invest more in technology can help the company compete better over the long run. Zee also has healthy financials and negligible debt.








 
 
The company’s overall revenue has grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13 per cent between FY13 and FY18, while profit has grown by 16 per cent during the same period.
Investors with two-to-three-year investment horizon can buy this stock.
For Zee, despite the GST-linked slowdown in various sectors, the ad revenue has grown steadily over the last few quarters. It recorded annual average growth of about 16 per cent between FY13 and FY18. This growth trend would continue, given the wide market reach and presence across genres in various regional languages. Also, given the macro economic factors and consumption pattern, the ad revenue in the television industry is expected to grow at annual average of 11 per cent between 2016 and 2020, according to the recent EY-FICCI report.
Zee currently produces about 500 hours of original content every week, and has lined up to deliver better content in the coming months; this could aid its ad revenue growth. The company has also planned to launch a new channel in Kerala by the end of FY19. Given its large content library, it should be able to leverage the new channel and attract advertisers.
 








 
Zee’s digital presence is slowly gaining traction. The company launched its Zee5 app combining its existing applications in digital platform — OZEE and Ditto TV — to offer more content to customers. Digital advertising is expected to grow at an annual average of 23 per cent from 2016 to 2020, as per the latest EY-FICCI report.
Currently, Zee offers 29 original content for Zee5 platform in six different languages. However, the monetisation from its digital platform will take time as the OTT (over the top) — where content is delivered over the internet without an operator — platform is crowded with players such as YouTube, Facebook, Hotstar, Netflix, telecom companies, and distribution platform owners such as Tata Sky.
Though the company plans to offer newer and differentiated content, the success and sustenance of the platform will have to be watched. This is one of the areas where the new strategic partner’s technology expertise can help the app globally and make it competitive.
Zee’s domestic subscription revenue accounts for about 30 per cent and, in the recent September quarter, grew by 26 per cent Y-o-Y, thanks to the company’s improved content offerings.
With the digitisation of cable television yet to take off completely across regions, there is scope for the company to increase its subscription growth. Also, launch of new programmes should provide a leg-up to subscription revenues. This, along with the implementation of TRAI’s tariff order, will have a positive impact. According to this order, broadcasters are required to offer their channels on a la carte basis, where the maximum retail price (MRP), excluding tax, for each pay channel should be disclosed. This order will come into effect from January 2019, and the company is already in discussions with its distribution partners for smooth transition.








 
 
The company is among the leading players in the Hindi GEC (general entertainment channels) through Zee TV and Cinema. Other channels such as Zee Marathi and Zee Bangla rank among the top three in the market. The popularity of some weekday shows such as Kumkum Bhagya, Kundali Bhagya in Zee TV and Mazhya Bavryachi Bayko in Zee Marathi has been attracting subscribers and advertisers.
The company reported overall revenue growth of 25 per cent Y-o-Y during the September quarter. Operating profit margins improved to 34 per cent during the September quarter from 30 per cent compared with the same period last year. The profit, however, declined by over 38 per cent Y-o-Y due to increase in tax expenses (over 76 per cent Y-o-Y) during this quarter, compared with the same period last year, and an exceptional item of ₹135 crore pertaining to the company’s sale of its sports channel last September quarter."

The outlook for Zee Entertainment is neutral. After moving in a range between ₹500 and ₹610, the stock fell to hit ₹410, after which it recovered a little. But, it could move in a narrow range with downward bias. Only a close above ₹565 will change the outlook to positive.
F&O pointer: The December contract accumulated over 4.5 lakh shares (3.63 per cent) on Friday with a sharp gain in underlying share price. This indicates positive bias. Option trading indicates a ₹460-520 range for the stock.
Strategy: We advise traders to consider a long strangle on Zee Entertainment. This can be done by buying 510-call and 440-put. These options closed with a premium of ₹6 and ₹4.10 respectively. As the market lot is 1,300 shares, this works out to ₹13,130.
The maximum loss is the premium paid. That will happen if the stock is stuck between ₹510 and ₹440.
However, profit potentialis huge, if the stock swings in one direction sharply. A close above ₹520.10 or below ₹429.90 will turn the position positive.
We advise traders to hold the position for two weeks or if the loss mounts to ₹7,500. Since the results of the State elections would be out on Tuesday, the stock could take a clear direction.

51,2019-01-17,Zee,"Zee Entertainment Enterprise: A stellar show
BL Research Bureau
The December quarter performance of Zee Entertainment, one of the largest players in the entertainment industry, was over and above industry estimates. Sustainable content, expansion in to new markets and launch of original content has aided the growth in the latest quarter.
The company has reported robust revenue growth across all its segments – advertisement, subscription and digital business, which indicate that the company is able to capitalise on its market position. Zee’s Zee5 application too was able to sustain its strong momentum with the company now reporting 56.3 million users as of December, a growth of 36 per cent over the September 2018.
Domestic business
Zee’s revenue grew about 18 per cent y-o-y to Rs 2,167 crore in the third quarter. While the overall advertisement revenue grew 22 per cent y-o-y, the domestic ad revenue registered growth of 21 per cent y-o-y driven by strong performance of broadcast business and ad spends from various sectors such as auto (two-wheeler segment) and e-commerce.
Robust viewership, not only for Zee TV (Hindi, the company’s core offering), but also for its regional channels such as Zee Bangla, Zee Marathi and Zee Kannada have helped in this growth.
In addition, monetisation of video content from digital business has also contributed to this growth.
Zee derives about 67 per cent of its revenue from advertisement, about 30 per cent from subscription and the remaining 3 per cent from other segments such as movies and music.
On the subscription front, though the revenue grew 23 per cent y-o-y, the domestic subscription expanded at a healthy pace of about 29 per cent y-o-y. The expansion to new market – Kerala (Zee Keralam) and launch of new shows has further strengthened its position in the market.
In addition to strong regional portfolio, Zee has one of the largest movie libraries among its peers which have helped garner new subscription. The telecom regulator’s new tariff order is likely to help the company’s subscription revenue growth, given its market share and content portfolio. The company is already in talk with its partners for smooth implementation.
The operating profits (EBITDA) increased by 30 per cent while the profits grew over 50 per cent to Rs 562 crore in the recent December quarter compared to same period last year.
Digital business expansion
Zee5 continues to gain viewership and is among the largest creator of digital content. The company was able to generate 31 original content and premiered 38 movies by end of December 2018. The app’s users spend about 31 minutes per day on an average on the platform and Zee5 has a maximum of three advertisements per show (each show is around 22 minutes).
The company has also launched multiple price subscription packs, especially for Southern content, which have seen good traction.
Zee5 content is available in 12 languages (Original content in six languages). The company plans to launch six shows, one in each language every month in FY20. Given the potential of OTT platform, the company intends to increase its investment in Zee5 in the coming years.
To increase viewership, the company has entered into partnership with key players in digital eco-system. For instance, Airtel subscribers with ARPU of Rs 199 and above can view selective content of Zee5 through Airtel TV application."

 With his back to the wall and sensing some drastic action from lenders, media baron Subhash Chandra on Friday made an emotional appeal to bankers to desist from reacting in an “anarchical manner” and be “patient” with him till his group completes the stake sale in crown jewel Zee Entertainment to help pay back dues. 
“I still believe, strongly feel, and would like to urge the lenders, not to react in an anarchical manner and to maintain patience till the process of ZEE Entertainment’s stake sale is completed. Post the sale process, we will be positively able to repay the entire dues, but if the lenders react in a panic, it will only hurt them and us,” Chandra, Chairman of ZEE and Essel Group, said in an open letter, a copy of which was made available to the media.
The letter came after Zee stocks got hammered on the stock exchanges. Zee Entertainment shares were down 26 per cent at ₹319 a piece at close on Friday on the BSE.
“I would again like to reiterate that I have no intention whatsoever to keep a single rupee till all the dues to the lenders are paid,” he said.
Apologising to his financial supporters, Chandra said: “For the first time in my career of 52 years, I am compelled to apologise to our bankers, NBFCs and mutual funds, since I believe that I have not lived up to to their expectations despite the best of my intentions.”
Pointing out the bets he took that went wrong, Chandra said that Essel Infra, like most infrastructure companies, made some incorrect bids. “In usual cases, infra companies have raised their hands and left their lenders with non-performing assets. But in our case, my obsession of not walking away from the situation made me to bleed ₹4,000-5000 crore. Despite the loss-making projects, we continued to pay the interest and the principle by borrowing funds against our shareholdings in listed companies, he wrote.
“My recommendation to my brother Jawahar Goel to buy D2H from Videocon was one more key error, which costed me and Jawahar a fortune. When our family business separation was implemented, as the eldest member of the family, I had taken the entire burden of the debts. Post which, most of my bets on the new businesses have not worked, which led to the increased debt due to the added interest levels.
“The situation at hand became further unmanageable after the IL&FS issue came to public light. Till then, we were managing our borrowings efficiently. The IL&FS meltdown stopped the rollovers, diminishing our ability to service our borrowings.”
The Group, Chandra said, took steps to retrieve the situation and till December, continued to pay the interest and principle, to all lenders.
“I have also given my best to expedite the stake sale of ZEE Entertainment. In fact, I have just returned from London after a series of positive meetings with potential suitors.
I am extremely certain that there is no promoter in India Inc. who has dared to sell the jewel of his crown to pay off the liabilities. While the process is still ongoing, there are some forces that are not willing to see us succeed”, he stated."
48,2019-01-27,Zee,"After IL&FS crisis, MF investments could be singed by exposure to Zee 
The mutual fund (MF) industry is bracing for fresh trouble with its exposure to Zee Group shares. It also has exposure of about ₹7,275 crore of the company’s debt papers. This comes even as MF players are facing heat from their exposure to the debt laden IL&FS Group. 
Aditya Birla MF’s debt exposure in the form of loans against Zee Group shares was to the tune of about ₹2,700 crore while those of HDFC Mutual Fund and Franklin Templeton were about ₹1,200 crore and ₹1,000 crore respectively.
SBI Mutual Fund and Baroda Pioneer Mutual Fund had investments of ₹506 crore and ₹500 crore, respectively. Reliance Mutual and Kotak Mutual Fund had exposures of ₹430 crore and ₹134 crore while that of DHFL Pramerica was ₹55 crore.
Though these fund houses’ exposure to Zee Group may seem small against their fund sizes, conservative MF investors are concerned about the future ability of the MF firms to protect their investments, with the possibility of successive writedowns after the IL&FS fiasco.
This apart, most of the MFs have invested about ₹1,800 crore directly in shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises as it is part of Nifty index.
The last straw on the Zee front came when its promoter Subhash Chandra, in a public statement, said: “For the first time in my career of 52 years, I am compelled to apologise to our bankers, NBFCs and mutual funds, since I believe that I have not lived up to their expectations despite the best of my intentions.
“I am extremely certain that there is no promoter in India Inc who has dared to sell the jewel of his crown to pay off the liabilities. While the process is still ongoing, there are some forces which are not willing to see us succeed. That said, I am not indicating that there are no mistakes done from my end, and as always, I am willing to face the consequences of the same. I assure you, that I am not running away from the core issue and will do my best to repay each and every person. The best time for the same, however, is difficult to be mentioned at this stage.” 
According to the BSE website, ₹7,580 crore worth of Zee Entertainment shares have been pledged. This is nearly 60 per cent of the value of the promoter’s stake. The 32 per cent fall in the stock price led to the creation of fresh pledges on Friday.
Mutual funds and NBFCs also hold promoters’ pledged shares of Zee Group companies such as Dish TV India, Zee Media and Zee Learn, which had fallen between 10 per cent and 33 per cent in Friday’s trade.
“The letter by the Group Chairman over the weekend could trigger fresh selling in Zee Group stocks. The stock could come under more pressure if MFs and NBFCs start selling the pledged shares,” said an analyst."
47,2019-01-31,Zee,"India’s still reeling-shadow banks face fresh cash shortage risk


India’s shadow lenders are facing a fresh threat, just as they were starting to recover from the fallout of landmark defaults last year by one of their own.
The lenders could come up against a new cash shortage, if concerns about debt at conglomerate Essel Group ricochet through India’s money markets, according to Citibank and Credit Suisse. There’s reason to think that may happen, the argument goes, after Essel’s billionaire founder Subhash Chandra said on Friday that it has increased debt levels and a diminished ability to service borrowings.
Here’s how things could get ugly: Mutual funds hold a lot of debt securities issued by Essel Group. Those funds also invest in commercial paper and other short-dated borrowings from the so-called non-bank financing companies. If the mutual funds face redemptions due to concerns about Essel, they might have to sell off NBFC debt also, which would effectively crimp an important financing channel for those shadow lenders.
Media tycoon Chandra said in an open letter that poor investments in the infrastructure sector combined with the meltdown of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. have led to increased debt and losses. Defaults at IL&FS have roiled the credit market and made it harder for other non-bank lenders to access funds.
Concerns about Essel may lead to a second wave of risk aversion in domestic debt funds and volatility in their flows, according to a Jan. 28 investor note by Credit Suisse Securities (India). 
* Essel, which has businesses ranging from media to infrastructure, is among the larger borrowers from local mutual funds, from which non-bank financial companies raise money, Credit Suisse said. 
* Mutual funds hold about ₹6,500 crore ($914 million) of debt securities issued by group companies, Essels spokeswoman said in an emailed response to a query. 
* Essel is trying to sell assets, including a stake in flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., to repay debt.
* Even as Essel and its lenders have announced an understanding regarding share pledges, its likely that institutional investors in some of the debt mutual funds with Essel holdings might seek redemptions, putting pressure on corporate bond market liquidity where mutual funds are a large player, according to Citibank Global Markets India. 
* We see a risk of liquidity conditions tightening further, especially in a seasonally tight February-to-March period, Citibank said in an investor note on Jan. 28."

 “Our intent has not changed...but if somebody is making an offer (to buy) beyond the 50 per cent stake we will look at it,” ZEEL MD and CEO Punit Goenka said in an analysts’ call. He was responding to a query on whether the promoters would be looking to sell a higher stake considering their holding has went down to 39.08 per cent following sale of 24.38 million pledged shares. As on December 31, 2018, promoters held 41.62 per cent stake in ZEEL.
 Goenka, however, said, as part of the talks with the potential investors, the promoters had earlier indicated willingness to sell around 20 per cent of their holding. Responding to another query on the number of potential buyers, Goenka said the figure of “at least two or more players” which he had put out in an earlier call with analysts “still holds“.
 Earlier this week, Essel group had sealed a formal agreement with its lenders to keep its companies afloat, under which it gets time till September to deleverage or pare its debt. Rs 13,500 crore is the loan against shares of all the listed companies of the promoters. Goenka said the group is working on multiple strategies; as and when which fructifies first, all of that equity realisation will go towards payment of this facility of Rs 13,500 crore. While he did not give an exact timeline for concluding stake sale by the promoters, Goenka said, the company has set a March-April deadline for the sale."

44,2019-03-31,Zee,"Zee Entertainment faces key resistance ahead 
Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
I have shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) at ₹440 each. Should I hold or sell these shares?
Harish Bale
Zee Entertainment Enterprises (₹444.3): Following a long-term uptrend, the stock encountered key resistance in the band between ₹600 and ₹620 in January 2018.
This resistance zone limited the stock’s rally in May 2018 and, thereafter, it began to decline. Since then, it has been in an intermediate-term downtrend. The stock witnessed a sharp plunge in late January this year and breached key supports at ₹420 and ₹320 in a single session and recorded a multi-year low at ₹288. Subsequently, it bounced up, recovering from the oversold territory.
 








 
The stock has been in a medium-tem uptrend since then. But it could face key resistance ahead in the ₹480-500 range, from which it began to decline in early March.
A strong break above this resistance can strengthen the medium-term uptrend and take the stock higher to ₹550.
A further breakthrough of the key medium-term resistance at ₹550 will alter the intermediate-term downtrend and take the stock up to ₹600 and ₹620 levels over the long run.
You can consider averaging the stock in declines, while maintaining a fixed stop-loss at ₹380.
On the downside, the stock has key supports at ₹420 and ₹350.
An emphatic downward break of ₹350 will strengthen the downtrend and drag the stock down to ₹300 or ₹288 once again. Investors with a long-term perspective can also consider holding the stock with a stop-loss at ₹380 levels.
I want to know trend for the stock of Gallant Metal.
Jagadeesh
Gallantt Metal (₹49.7): The shares of Gallantt Metal have been volatile, with very low liquidity in the counter as well. It tends to move from circuit to circuit.
 








 
 
After encountering resistance at ₹65 in November 2018, the stock began to trend downwards. Since then, it has been in a medium-term downtrend. Key resistance at around ₹55 is capping the upside. A strong break above ₹55 will alter the medium-term downtrend and take the stock up to ₹58 and ₹62 over the medium term.
On the other hand, a conclusive fall below the ₹42-45 band will reinforce the downtrend and drag the stock down to ₹40 and ₹36 in the medium term.
Generally, investors with a long-term perspective should avoid buying stocks that have low liquidity and which move from circuit to circuit as they don’t provide clear buying or selling opportunity.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd is a media and entertainment company engaged in providing broadcasting services. The company operates through content and broadcasting segment. It offers content in multiple languages and offers approximately 38 international and over 30 domestic channels. The company has a library, housing over 2,22,703 hours of television content. The company holds rights to approximately 3,820 movie titles.

We reinitiate coverage on ZEEL with a ‘reduce’ rating and revised target price of ₹391, valuing the stock at 21xFY20E P/E. Our key reasons for concern are: 1) ZEEL’s inability to sustain the surprisingly high growth in its domestic pay-TV revenues in 9MFY19; and 2) On-ground disruption with the new tariff order (NTO) coming into force. We have cut our advertising and subscription revenue estimates for FY20E and FY21E, resulting in 9 per cent reduction in earnings estimates for FY20E & FY21E. 
We also argue that value of Zee Entertainment as an independent entity is less without the group ownership of distribution assets — Dish TV and Siti Network."

Billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Bharti Mittal are considering competing bids for a stake in a troubled Indian television network, people with knowledge of the matter said, as their telecom carriers race for content in the worlds second-biggest mobile market.
Mittal’s Bharti Airtel Ltd has started due diligence of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd and is expected to make a formal proposal soon, one of the people said, asking not to be identified citing confidentiality. Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is also considering a bid, the people said.
Deliberations are preliminary and may not lead to a transaction, they said.
A representative for Zee said the company does not comment on speculation though it is in steady dialogue with potential partners. A spokesperson for Bharti said the company is not in the race to acquire the television network.
A successful deal would help the winning bidder add a slew of video services in the scramble for user revenue as the government prepares to auction 5G airwaves this year. Some of the worlds largest telecommunications companies including AT&T Inc, Vodafone Group Plc and KDDI Corp have been buying film and television production and cable TV assets to bolster earnings as subscribers level off.
Bidding for such assets has accelerated as entertainment providers themselves gather content to offer programming via the Internet and compete with upstarts like Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s Prime service.
The objectives of the telecommunication companies will not be necessarily to own Zee, but have adequate strategic stake so as to play into the distribution opportunity on their high-speed networks, Mumbai-based Alok Shende, principal analyst at consulting firm Ascentius Insights said. Interest in Zee is reflective of the triple play opportunity that is unfolding in the Indian market, he said, referring to the ability of mobile players to bundle carriage, content and commerce on a single platform.
Shares of Zee climbed 3.2 per cent in Mumbai on Thursday, leading gains in the S&P BSE 100 Index. Reliance Industries Ltd, Jio’s parent company, declined 1.6 per cent while Bharti rose 1.9 per cent.
Zee, the heavily-indebted broadcaster controlled by former rice trader-turned-media mogul Subhash Chandra, is seeking a strategic investor to help fend off competition from Netflix, Amazon and hundreds of local TV channels vying to tap India’s booming demand for content.
Zee, which boasts 1.3 billion viewers across 173 countries through its 78 channels and 4,800 movie titles, has previously attracted interest from Sony Corp and Comcast Corp but has not found a buyer yet. The television network has offered to sell half of the controlling family’s shares, of which 59 per cent is pledged as collateral to lenders.
Jio stormed the market in 2016 with free calls and cheap data and forced some rivals to retreat or merge. Bharti, once number 1, has been relegated to second position after Vodafone’s local unit combined with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular.
While Bharti has been adding some digital services to its portfolio, such as apps for e-books and music, its scale has not matched Jio, which already offers a bouquet of services including Saavn, a music app, television, news and movies.
In February, Bharti revealed plans to raise as much as Rs 32000 crores ($4.6 billion) from a rights issue and bond sales to build a war chest as competition with Jio intensifies. Last year, Bharti entered into a content deal with Zee for exclusive videos on Airtel applications.
Bharti and Singapore Telecommunications Ltd plan to make a combined offer of about Rs 6150 crores to acquire about 60 per cent of Dish TV India Ltd, CNBC-TV18 reported on Thursday, citing people it did not identify."

Zee Entertainment on Friday announced a quiz program titled Mind Wars for school students across India. Mind Wars will be hosted on a multi-platform ecosystem, hoping to provide a knowledge acceleration program for students studying in grade 6th to 10th. 
The company aims to build a property that will span across both, digital and TV, backed with on-ground presence across the country to target 1 crore students from 40,000 schools across 200+ cities of India.
Mind Wars will offer an open platform for school kids to benchmark them against their peers on a national scale using multi-platform testing formats across three content buckets: Curriculum, General Knowledge and Current Affairs. With a well curated gratification pattern at each level, Mind Wars aims to maintain a strong engagement level for the schools and students.

   -  Tero Vesalainen


Even as Netflix tries to expand its user base in the country with mobile-only plans that cost about half the usual monthly subscription, Zee Entertainment is working on similar plans to expand its paid subscriber base. 
In an interview with BusinessLine, Zee5 CEO Tarun Katial said the company is testing out multiple pricing models that will create more options for Zee5 subscribers. 
“We are planning 3-4 things. There will be mobile-only packs that’ll be 30 per cent cheaper. We’re toying with single language versus multiple language packs. You can get Tamil and add a couple of languages to that. We are also testing plans that will be supported by limited advertising. In that you can choose the kind of ads that you’d like to see. It will be a cheaper plan subsidised through advertising,” Katial said. 
Unlike other OTT platforms that typically have a standard premium pricing, Zee5 already has multiple subscription packs. These include separate packs for Tamil, Telugu and Kannada viewers. An all-access pack that includes Hindi and select English content is priced at ₹99 a month against ₹49 for a single language pack.
 The new plans allows users ou to add multiple language packs together that’ll still be cheaper than the all-access pack. This will help multilingual families that like to watch both Tamil and Kannada content, he said. 
The new plans come in anticipation of large investments that the company is making in generating original shows and movies for Zee5, which would put immense pressure on the finances of cash strapped Zee Entertainment. 
 As many as 72 originals — 60 new shows and 12 new movies — are planned to be launched in the next one year. One new movie and several new shows will be launched every month. 
As a next move, Zee5 plans to look at smart TV audience with a difference lens — a group that is willing to pay higher for premium content, and that would want to watch English or international content and doesn’t want to be bothered by any advertising at all. 
Hotstar also recently launched new plans to expand its paid customer reach. However, Hotstar doesn’t segregate TV audiences from a wider mobile audience, keeping a standard price across screens — pricing only varies based on the content being offered. 
Zee5 hopes that the new pricing models will help it serve smaller markets better with quality content — markets that are primarily mobile based and so far were not able to watch videos because of their entry level phones. 
“Digital advertising so far has been a metro phenomenon with some traction in tier-2/3 cities. But this takes it to the heart of rural India where people are not willing to pay for cable TV connection. 
Videos could not be served on low-end smartphones. But now with Jio Phone, you get access to video even on very basic phones,” Katial said. 
“Our understanding is that a large number of advertisers are trying to reach out to that audience but without much success. We’ve not only been able to re-purpose content for the audience but also have a strong understanding of that audience with our large library of Bhojpuri content and a fairly large content footprint in other regional languages. The content availability is not an issue and now the device and connectivity issue is also taken care of,” Katial pointed out. 
Zee5 is betting on device and telco partnerships to bring in new paid subscribers. Currently, less than 10 per cent of the paid subscribers come through partners and platforms. But partnerships will help the OTT player reach the scale where it can hope to be profitable faster."

In a separate filing, the company said it was not in a position to provide any comment or clarification regarding the stake sale process by its promoters, Essel Group. On Tuesday, promoters of Essel Group had said its stake sale process in ZEEL is at an advanced stage.
Last year in November, the promoters had stated that they planned to divest up to 50 per cent of their stake in ZEEL to a strategic partner. “Understandably, in accordance with the said intent, the promoters have been in discussions/negotiations with various prospective investors and the company is not in a position to provide any comment or clarification until such time any potential investor is identified and such arrangement is disclosed by the promoters to the board of directors of the company,” ZEEL said in the filing."

Zee’s Zee5 application too was able to sustain its strong momentum with the company now reporting 61.5 million users as of March, a growth of 49 per cent over the September 2018.
The domestic ad revenue registered growth of 18 per cent Y-o-Y, helped by launch of new shows and increase in ad spends from various sectors. But domestic subscription registered a muted single-digit growth of 4 per cent Y-o-Y. This is mainly attributed to the implementation of TRAI’s tariff order, which led to subscriber disruptions, as distributors took time to cope up with consumer demand. Operating margins declined to 28 per cent in the March 2019 quarter from 35 per cent in the year-ago period.
This could be due to an increase in content costs for Zee5 and rise in advertisement and publicity expenses for the new Kerala channel, Zee5, tariff order and movie production. However, profit growth was aided by lower interest, depreciation and tax expenses."

Driven by 46.8 per cent y-o-y growth in domestic subscription revenue, Zee’s Q1 FY20 revenue grew 13.3 per cent y-o-y to ₹2,008 crore. Domestic advertising revenue grew 4.2 per cent y-o-y, as 5-6 per cent of advertising growth has been hit by the conversion of two FTA (free-to-air) channels into pay channels. Lower other expenses due to good cost control (8.6 per cent versus 12.8 per cent y-o-y) resulted in the margin expanding 93 bps y/y to 32.9 per cent. We cut our FY20e/FY21e Ebitda 4 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively, and our target multiple to 15x FY21e Ebitda (earlier valuing it at 17x FY21e Ebitda) to reflect soft ad growth and increased investment in OTT, resulting in a target of ₹450 (earlier ₹550). The promoter stake sale is a near-term catalyst.
 Investments in digital will further increase in FY20 as the company ramps up production of ZEE5 Originals and movie offerings across languages.

 Subhash Chandra-led Zee Group could soon be out of its debt woes. 
A consortium led by US cable company Comcast, including Atairos, Blackstone and James Murdoch’s Lupa Systems, has put in a non-binding bid to acquire a majority stake in Zee Entertainment.
 Zee already has another offer from an Asian investor group, according to sources close to the development. The company is expected to finalise the deal in two days, said a source. 
The promoter group owns an about 36 per cent stake in Zee Entertainment. If the deal goes through, Chandra may completely exit the company. 
Zee Entertainment shares were trading at ₹381 a piece on the BSE at close on Tuesday. At this price, the market cap of Zee Entertainment is ₹36,613 crore. 
Zee Group is being forced to sell its stake in the entertainment business as part of its debt reduction plan. Other group entities including Essel Infrastructure’s road and solar assets are also on the block separately. 
In January, Chandra had said the group had successfully arrived at an understanding with lenders that have a lien on shares held by the promoters. Under this agreement, the group managed to buy time till September to conclude deleveraging exercises before lenders moved to declare it a defaulter. The largest divestment planned by Essel Infraprojects is in the roads segment. The company has put six of its 14 projects up for sale, including two State highways and four NHAI projects, and is aiming to raise ₹11,000-12,000 crore.
According to sources, talks are on with multiple players who have evinced interest in acquiring these assets and deals would be in place ahead of the September deadline."

Punit Goenka, MD and CEO, Zee Entertainment




Punit Goenka, MD and CEO, Zee Entertainment


After nearly six months of negotiations with several strategic investors, which included Comcast and Sony Pictures, the Subhash Chandra-backed Essel Group has decided to sell 11 per cent promoter stake in Zee Entertainment (ZEEL) to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund.
Invesco Oppenheimer, one of the oldest investors in the company, already holds 8 per cent in ZEEL and has been an investor for about 17 years. The fund has now agreed to buy up to an 11 per cent stake in ZEEL from its promoters, for a total consideration of up to ₹4,224 crore, taking its stake in the company to 19 per cent. Punit Goenka, CEO at Zee Enterprises, told BusinessLine that he expects the deal to close before the end of August.
At market price, the deal offers more than a 10 per cent premium to Zee promoters. Post the deal, the promoters will hold just over 25 per cent in Zee Entertainment.
“My first preference was a strategic partner. But I had to keep financial investors ready as backup. It’s unfortunate the strategic partner didn’t understand the gravity of the situation. So we took a hard decision this weekend that we’ll go with a financial investor,” Goenka said. The Zee Group has about ₹11,000 crore of promoter debt that the company is trying to repay by the end of September. While the deal with Oppenheimer fund doesn’t cover even half of the fund requirements, it does give the company a floor price that will help them with further negotiations.
The balance funds needed to settle the debt will be raised by selling non-media assets of the Zee group such as road and solar projects.
“We have non-binding term sheets already with us (to sell non-media assets). This term sheet (with Oppenheimer) will give our corporate team some strength to negotiate harder. Because suddenly, ₹4,200 crore of liquidity will come into the group. That will ease the pressure. We will completely exit the non-media assets,” Goenka said. Goenka said if the company is unable to raise enough money from selling non-media assets, it may sell additional 4-5 per cent of Zee Entertainment stake to other financial investors. “Oppenheimer and us will jointly look at whom we can bring in as the next financial investor,” said Goenka."

Punit Goenka, MD and CEO, Zee Entertainment




Punit Goenka, MD and CEO, Zee Entertainment


 
The Zee Group’s decision to sell stake in its flagship Zee Entertainment was a forced one given the pressure from lenders to settle their debt of ₹11,000 crore by September. While a number of players including Comcast were keen to buy a stake in it, US-based Invesco Oppenheimer, which already owns 8 per cent stake in the company, emerged the white knight. BusinessLine spoke with Punit Goenka, MD & CEO at Zee Enterprises, to understand the contours of the deal. Excerpts:
How tough was the decision to sell given Zee Entertainment is the jewel in the group’s crown?
It’s not a difficult choice once you come to terms with it. I came to terms with it on January 25 itself. The momentum on the deal picked up only after the elections because anyone from outside the country making that kind of investment in India just around the general elections wanted to be certain, especially when the rumour mill on the election was of chalk and cheese. 
What took you so long to close the deal?
My first preference was a strategic partner. But I had to keep financial investors as backup ready and that’s what I was doing. It’s unfortunate the strategic partner didn’t understand the gravity of the situation. And the time lines they wanted to close the deal was not in line with what we needed. So we took a hard decision that we’ll go with a financial investor.
In hindsight, do you think it’s better you have a financial investor now that don t have to give out any board seats?
Even the strategic investors I had spoken to wanted us to run the company. One investor wanted full control. We were open to that as well but its just that the timelines did not work out for us given the September deadline to pay off our debt.
Why were you looking at strategic players?
It’s not just money. Our aspiration to be a media company from the emerging markets has not changed. We believed a strategic partner would’ve helped us do that. Our DNA is to think about content, it is not to think about technology. Therefore, a strategic partner would have been better. Now we will have to work out alliances but right now our focus is to run the company, continue to build Zee5, continue to build the broadcasting portfolio. We’ll start thinking next year about what we want to do once this debt issue is settled. 
 The strategic investors wanted more time to close the deal or were they giving you lesser valuation?
Valuation was secondary. They made an offer and I didn’t even negotiate it. My question to them was can you meet my timeline. They said they cannot meet my timeline. We were very open to sell to even the investors who wanted complete control as long as they took care of the entire debt situation. 
Once you exit the non-media assets, how much of stakes do you think you’d still have to sell in Zee?
My priority now is to pay off debt. If there is any short fall after selling the non media asssets, I’ll have to generate from the media assets. My estimation is that I will be left with significant shareholding, which will be motivating enough for us to continue to work with the same vigour and passion with which we’ve built the company. 
How close are you to selling your non-media assets?
We have non-binding term sheets already with us. This deal will give our corporate team some strength to negotiate harder. Because suddenly, ₹4,200 crore of liquidity will come into the group. That will ease the pressure. We will completely exit non-media assets. Earlier we were expecting a huge amount to come from them. Obviously, they will not come to those numbers but it will be reasonable. After that, we might still have to sell about additional 4-5 per cent stake in Zee. 
Will the additional stake sale be done to a new financial investor?
Yes because Oppenheimer will not be able to buy those stakes because they have a technical cap of 20 per cent on a single scrip. They already had 8 per cent stake in the company. Oppenheimer and us will jointly look at whom can we bring in as the next financial investor. 
 What does the deal mean for Zee entertainment business?
The concern over debt is more or less over. Other than that it’s business as usual. Teams have been working hard, growth is coming. We will exit all non media business so our entire focus will be fully on media. 
 With Invesco holding nearly 20%, does this open up the possibility of a takeover bid, like how it happened with Mindtree?
For an investor who has been with us for 17 years I doubt Invesco Oppenheimer will do anything like that. Then you are telling the world that you do such thing behind the back of promoters, which is not a good reputation to have in the financial markets. It’s a two-way relationship. If I was not a good partner to them why would do they do this investment. If they want to exit at some point we can sit together and work it out. If liquidity improves even we can buy it back from them. 
Was it difficult to get Invesco Oppenheimer to agree on the valuation?
Not at all, It took hardly 45 minutes over a breakfast."

CMP: ₹341.5
Target: ₹410
Zee Entertainment has announced its long-awaited stake sale of 11 per cent to Invesco Oppenheimer Funds for ₹400 a share, which is a premium of 10 per cent over the CMP and a mere 5 per cent premium over the six-month average price of ₹387 accordin to norms. Post completion of the deal, the Oppenheimer stake in the company will be around 19 per cent.
The only positive outcome of this deal is promoters retaining control. However, we are surprised by management’s confidence over fetching a higher value for non-media assets (infra, solar and transmission), given troubled times in these verticals. Invesco Oppenheimer is already an existing shareholder with a 7.7 per cent stake; an increased stake by an existing investor has not excited us after such a prolonged delay to execute the deal, but it has provided some respite for further downside on the stock, which continues to trade at an inexpensive valuation of 17x FY21E P/E. Hence, we reiterate our ‘Accumulate’ rating with a target price of ₹410 based on 20x FY21E P/E, given the stock does not provide scope for a major re-rating, given the threat of digital content consumption, which would be bolstered further by the launch of Jio FTH in the near term."

The assets, owned by Essel Green Energy Pvt Ltd and Essel Infraprojects Ltd, are located in Punjab, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. They have long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with State electricity distribution companies.
This is the second major deal announced by Essel Group, which is racing against time to settle its debt. Earlier, it had decided to sell an 11 per cent promoter stake in Zee Entertainment (ZEEL) to Invesco Oppenheimer for ₹4,224 crore.
The promoter debt was initially at ₹11,000 crore. Following the deals with Oppenheimer and Adani, the overall debt will be ₹5,476 crore.
Essel Group has entered a standstill agreement with lenders under which it has promised to pay off its entire debt by the end of September.

For print media players such as DB Corp and Jagran Prakashan, effective tax rates in FY19, after eligible exemptions and tax incentives, work out to 28-36 per cent of their standalone PBT.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) will invest heavily in regional markets, where it sees a 70-90 per cent growth potential.
According to Prathyusha Agarwal, CMO, ZEEL, nearly 50 per cent of the company’s viewership comes from its regional portfolio, which includes entertainment and movie channels. With growth coming in such high double digits, “more original content” is being worked-on.
“Nearly, 70-90 per cent growth is coming from regional channels. There is a huge opportunity to grow in regional and rural. Naturally, we will make more active investments in the segment,” she said without sharing investment details.
Apart from advertising, TRAI’s new tariff order has led to other monetisation opportunities, she said. An increase in subscription revenue is a positive impact of the new tariff order, she said, adding that ZEEL’s subscription base grew 46 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal.
Nationally, TV viewership grew 1.30 per cent year-on-year in Q1 FY20, following the implementation of the tariff order, she observed.
ZEEL is also planning to get into the production of Bengali films. It already owns a movie production and distribution company, Zee Studios, which has been producing movies under the Zee Bangla Cinema Originals brand. These movies are created every month for TV audiences and are aired on its regional channel.
But the plan now, according to Samrat Ghosh, Cluster Head - East, ZEEL, is to look at releasing some of the ‘originals’ in theatres. “By December, there could be a concrete plan around this,” he said.
He further said the West Bengal government’s rule mandating the screening of Bengali films in theatres and multiplexes for at least 120 days in a year, during prime time (12 noon to 9 pm), should give a fillip to the industry.
The Bengali film industry has been having a rough patch. Apart from mounting losses, poor time slots at multiplexes has been cited as an issue by film producers."

Zee Entertainment second quarter net profits were up 6.9 percent at Rs Rs 413.20 crore for the quarter ended September 30, as the broadcaster moved to a new corporate tax structure, that was announced by the Finance Minister last month.
The revenue rose 7.4 per cent over last year to Rs 2,122 crore in the three months through September. The company’s advertising revenue rose 1.2 per cent to Rs 1,224.70 crore, while the subscription revenue rose 19 per cent to Rs 723.50 crore.
“Overall TV broadcast industry saw about 4 per cent de-growth in the quarter in terms of ad revenues and we still had about 2 percent growth despite two of our highly profitable FTA channels being switched off,” Punit Goenka, Managing Director and CEO, Zee Entertainment, said during an analyst call. 
“Reach of all the pay channels had been impacted during the implementation of new tariff order. In the regional markets, there has been a strong revival of reach post the disruption in early days of the NTO, and in almost all these markets, recovery in reach has been better than competition,” he said.
The company's profitability was also impacted due to the delayed payments from related parties Dish TV and Siti Cable.
“The debtors have gone up this quarter on account of delayed payments from Dish and Siti Cable,” acknowledged Goenka. “We have received binding and definitive payment plan from both and expect to bring it down in Q3 and Q4.
Total receivables in the quarter stood at Rs 2,500 crore of which Rs 700 crore were related party.
The increase in profits were primarily driven by lower tax paid by the company in the quarter, adjusting for lower tax rates announced by the government recently.
“FM had announced reduction in corporate tax rate. We see that adjustment in the quarter. Tax rate has come down from 33 per cent to about 25 per cent now. We will see benefit in cash flow as well in the coming quarter. Hopefully, in next 2 quarters, our tax outgo should improve by 200-300 crore,” Goenka said.
Domestic ad revenues grew 1.4 per cent in the quarter, which was impacted by the tough macro-economic environment which had a negative effect on demand across categories, the company said. The impact on growth due to conversion of two channels from FTA to pay in March continued during the quarter. As the quarter progressed, advertising spends witnessed a gradual improvement helped by the onset of festive season.
Goenka said he remained bullish about the second half of the financial year and hopes the festive season will bring back cheer to the industry.
“Festive season will drive ad growth for the industry as well as for us. Given our network share and consolidated market positioning, it gives us far more leverage to negotiate better rates. So while the industry may still have a flat revenue growth in H2, we will continue to grow,” Goenka said."

In a bid to reduce promoter debt, Zee Entertainment CEO on Thursday said the promoters may divest controlling stakes in Essel group company Zee Learn. 
Zee Learn, a listed entity on the Indian bourses, has a market capitalisation of about ₹550 crore with annual revenues of about ₹550 crore during the last fiscal year. 
""We have been approached by some marquee investors, both strategic and financial, for the Zee Learn stake and we are considering their offers seriously,"" Punit Goenka, CEO at Zee Entertainment, said during an investor call on Thursday. 
Zee Learn revenues have been growing at about 50 per cent CAGR in the last few years. It has more than 4 lakh students and 50K teachers/staff in its network. Its brands include Kidzee (Pre K chain), Mount Litera (K12 chain), Mahesh Tutorial (Test Prep & Tutorial chain) and Robomate. 
Essel group promoters who currently have 90 per cent of their shares in Zee Entertainment pledged to raise capital, are hoping to earn over ₹3,500 crore from the deal, if it goes through. 
Essel promoters currently have a debt of ₹7,000 crore, which they are trying to cut down by selling non-media assets including road and solar projects. BusinessLine reported this week that the promoters are in talks with the National Infrastructure and Investment Fund (NIIF) to sell six road projects for about ₹4,000 crore.

The promoter group recently disclosed that it had 10.71 per cent Zee Entertainment shares pledged with Russian investment bank VTB Capital.

The stock of Zee Entertainment, one of the largest players in the entertainment industry, is down about 8 per cent today in bourses. This follows the weak September quarter results that were announced yesterday.
Muted revenue from advertisements, promoter’s stake sale overhang and decline in cash-flow due to a sustained increase in working capital requirements are weighing on the stock.
In the September quarter, Zee reported revenue of ₹2,122 crore, up 7.4 per cent, y-o-y. Though the domestic subscription business registered robust double-digit growth, it was partly offset by muted advertisement revenue. The Zee5 application continued to sustain its strong momentum with the company now reporting daily active users of 8.9 million.
Zee’s profit growth was 6.9 per cent (₹413 crore) in the quarter.
The operating profit margins contracted 100 basis points to 33 per cent in the September 2019 quarter. This is mainly due to an increase in programming cost, up 23 per cent, y-o-y. The increase in expense was primarily driven by content cost for Zee5 platform.
Zee reported robust revenue growth in its broadcast business with subscription revenue registering an increase of 19 per cent y-o-y. Healthy viewership, not only for Zee TV (Hindi, core offering), but also for its regional channels such as Zee Bangla, Zee Marathi, Zee Keralam and Zee Kannada have helped in this growth.
With the impact of new tariff order settled in the market, it can capitalise on its market position and thereby increase its viewership. The company registered a domestic subscription growth of 27 per cent y-o-y. Sustainable content, expansion to new markets and launch of original content have also aided the company’s revenue. It also has plans to launch new channels in regional markets and increase its viewership base.
Besides, monetisation of video content from digital business, Zee5, has also contributed to this growth. Zee has 23 original shows and movies during the quarter and commits to producing over 70 original content this fiscal year. The partnerships with telecos are also working well for the Zee5 to build traction and strengthen its position in the competitive OTT space.
The domestic advertisement revenue grew 1.4 per cent y-o-y due to slowdown in the overall economy. Despite the conversion of two free-to-air channels to pay channels in March, ad revenue didn’t pick up for Zee as advertisers preferred to give ads in other free channels.
Zee derives about 67 per cent of its revenue from advertisement, about 30 per cent from subscription and the remaining 3 per cent from other segments such as movies and music.
With the onset of festive season, ad spends have seen gradual improvement says Zee’s management. But sustenance of this trend needs to be watched. Zee5 has launched about five ad-suite products to offer customised advertisement solutions to brands. This is likely to aid advertisement growth going ahead.
While Zee has the potential to increase its ad and subscription revenue given its market penetration and product portfolio, the sustained increase in working capital requirements has impacted the operating cash flows. It has fallen to negative ₹246 crore in the September quarter from ₹304 crore during the same quarter last year. Further, given the lack of clarity on trade receivables from multiple system operators, including Dish TV and Siti Cable, there is a risk of pressure increasing on cash flows. Zee’s management, however, is confident and expects cash flows to turn positive by FY21.
The stock of Zee Entertainment has been falling sharply since last one month with investors fearing that the promoters may not able to find an potential investor for their assets, and that lenders may sell the pledged shares of the promoter in the market.
In September, some lenders - Kotak Mutual Fund and SBI Mutual, did sell the pledged shares of the promoters of Zee. But still, there is a huge amount of debt (borrowed by pledging shares) that the promoter – Essel Group needs to payback.
In a conference call with investors in October, the company’s promoters said that while they had agreed to sell 11 per cent of their stake in Zee Entertainment to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund for a total consideration of Rs 4,224 crore in July to settle some lenders, only 8.7 per cent of stake was sold, and, 2.3 per cent stake is still with the promoters. The management however sounded confident that it will be able to repay the entire promoters’ debt in three months’ time.
The total loan raised by the Essel Group promoters by pledge of their shares is Rs 7000 crore of which Rs 5000 crore is due to domestic lenders and Rs 2000 crore is due to VTB Capital (Russian investment bank).
The promoter’s holding in Zee is 22 per cent (as disclosed by the management in the conference call in October)."
11,2019-11-18,Zee,"Zee Entertainment’s preference shares downgraded to ‘AA+’ by Brickwork ratings
Brickwork Ratings (BWR) India Pvt Ltd has downgraded the credit rating of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd’s (ZEEL) 6 per cent Cumulative Redeemable Non-Convertible Preference Shares aggregating ₹1210.16 crore from ‘AAA’ to ‘AA+”.
The credit rating agency also downgraded ZEEL’s issuer rating from ‘AAA’ to ‘AA+”.
In its rating rationale, BWR said that the downgrade factors in the deteriorating financial flexibility of the group marked by increased pledge of promoter holding to the level of 96 per cent, continuous volatility in share price movement of ZEEL resulting in substantial decline in market capitalisation, and promoter group’s inability to repay full debt against pledge of ZEEL shares as per committed time lines.
The agency said that Russia’s VTB Capital, acting on behalf of certain lenders, disclosed that it has secured rights of 102 million shares (about 10.7 per cent stake) in ZEEL held by Essel Media Ventures, a promoter group company, against a loan agreement entered into during September 2017. 
In case promoters fail to resolve the issue of debt at the promoter group level, it may lead to invocation/sale of pledged shares by the lenders, it said. 
BWR observed that all these issues will substantially bring down promoters’ holding, resulting in uncertainties about ownership and management control. According to the agency, the aforementioned ratings continue to be on “Credit Watch with Negative Implications” on account of overhang of debt at promoter group levels and stretched pledge position of the group holdings in ZEEL and resultant uncertainties.
The agency noted that the ratings, however, continue to factor in established track record of the promoters in Indian television broadcasting industry and presence in media and entertainment industry for more than two decades. 
The rating factors in presence of brand Zee in the Indian media space and large array of channels, investment in programming through launch of new channels as well as increase in original programming hours on existing channels, and expansion in international markets and alternate platforms such as Digital TV. 
The ratings also takes note of satisfactory financial profile as reflected in increase in scale of operations, low debt and adequate cash and cash equivalents, the agency said"

Zee Entertainment stock gained Rs 38.10, up 12.40 per cent on BSE on Thursday. The benchmark BSE Sensex index closed 76.47 points lower on Thursday.
Goenka will continue to remain the CEO, and the promoters will maintain management control over Zee despite the single-digit stakes they'd be left with. This is because largest stakeholder in Zee Invesco Oppenheimer has shown no interest in either a board seat or any management control.
Post the sale, Subhash Chandra and his son will be left with only about 5 per cent stake in their flagship company, of which 1.1 per cent stakes are still encumbered with creditors.
The promoters of Essel group are trying to cut down on its debt of about ₹7,000 crore by selling 16.5 per cent stakes in Zee Entertainment, a deal they are hoping could fetch them in excess of ₹5,000 crore.
Existing investor Invesco Oppenheimer will be buying 2.3 per cent of this 16.5 per cent stakes through subsidiary OFI Global China Fund.
The investment from Invesco however, is part of the 11 per cent stake sale earlier announced by the company, which was supposed to fetch ₹4,224 crore.
The promoters currently owe about ₹7,000 crore to mutual funds and financial investors, including Russia's VTB Capital, which has encumbered about 10.71 per cent stake in Zee Entertainment.
The promoter group is also planning to sell stakes in Zee Learning, in which they still have a majority stakeholding.
“The Group is also working actively on further divestments, including its media/ non-media assets, and remains confident to complete the same,” the Zee statement said."
