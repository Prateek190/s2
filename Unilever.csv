Paul Polman Sustainable vision
   -  JEENAH MOON


Earlier this year, the Saïd Business School at Oxford asked its MBA students to pick a business that would best describe their institution: “Are we the Microsoft of Business Schools, are we the Goldman Sachs or the Uber?”
The students concluded that their aspiration was to be the Unilever of Business Schools. The Saïd Dean recounted that conversation in the presence of Paul Polman, an indication of the kind of influence the CEO of Unilever has had as the champion of the triple bottomline approach that he pushed at his company.
This year-end, Polman’s decade-long journey at Unilever comes to an end amid circumstances that have pitted shareholders against his attempt to simplify the corporate structure and shift the headquarters of the company from London to Rotterdam. A shift would have made it near-impossible for a hostile takeover attempt of the kind mounted last year by Kraft Heinz.
The move to shift failed and Polman decided to retire, a less-than-happy exit for a leader who has stood out as one of the most important voices on sustainability in the thick of a highly competitive business. But how sustainable is Polman’s way, which he executed through what he called the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan that promised to cut the Unilever footprint by half and grow the business at the same time.
He achieved this rather obliquely by de-emphasising the share price and refusing to give out quarterly numbers, building on it with a sharp focus on sustainable actions and none of the ruthless cutbacks and aggressive takeovers that the Kraft Heinz Company is known for.
Yet, fund managers and shareholders work with a different agenda governed more by higher profits and rising stock prices in the near term, not necessarily the long-term view that Polman brought into fashion at Unilever.
Despite growing awareness of sustainability, consumption patterns remain unsustainable especially in developed markets.
Unilever reports that over half of all consumers already buy or want to buy sustainably. Unilever’s sustainable brands have outperformed the average growth rate over the last four years and in 2017 they delivered 70 per cent of turnover growth.
A lot of that turnover is increasingly coming from the emerging markets that are a magnet for MNCs looking for the next wave of growth. As these markets (including India) push GDP growth, they offer opportunities unavailable in developed economies. Unilever says 58 per cent of its business is in emerging markets. But competition is fierce. The opportunities and pressures have stretched the meaning of the term innovation, leading to some very unsustainable ideas.
For example, Unilever once marketed food products in India called “Amaze”, promoting it as “brain food” for the “mental and physical development of children” until the regulator stepped in. Fair & Lovely builds on the very unsustainable idea of selling fair skin as desirable.
One way to look at Polman’s work is to say there is only so much a large company can do. It was bold for its time but not bold enough to fire up the markets about a new set of consumers who demand from companies a new order and new respect for the planet and her resources.
Polman promoted sustainability and in return took home a package that reportedly amounted to £10.3 million, one of the reasons cited by the investors unhappy with his performance. Such high packages are among the reason that investors have lost trust in big business. In that sense, Polman played with the new but was ensconced in the old — a “tempered radical” who, as the term goes, “identifies with and is committed to the organisation, and is also committed to a cause, community, or ideology that is fundamentally different from, and possibly at odds with the dominant culture of the organisation.”
The next level of sustainable businesses will demand fundamentally different models that can work with and echo the demands of deep ecology, which in the words of authors Fritjof Capra and Pier Luisi “asks profound questions about the very foundations of our modern, scientific, industrial, growth-oriented, materialistic worldview and way of life.
The business model that captures this spirit is a long way off. But whenever it emerges, it will have Polman to thank as one of its early pioneers, a leader who was bold enough to act and go on record: “We are at a turning point. Only businesses that help people and planet thrive will succeed. We have to scale our impact through partnership, collaboration and trust.”

18,2018-12-09,Unilever,"A healthy deal 
The merger of Glaxo SmithKline Consumer (GSK Consumer) with Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is a good deal for shareholders of both entities. Following the buyout of GSK Consumer by HUL for ₹31,700 crore, shareholders of the former will get 4.39 shares of HUL for every share held in GSK Consumer. The deal comes at a time when FMCG stocks have rallied over the last two years, thanks to the revival in demand, after the demonetisation and GST changeover.
Besides, the market volatility this year has also led to investors taking to FMCG stocks as a defensive bet. GSK Consumer shares have moved up by 50 per cent over the last two years, while HUL shares have more than doubled.
In this backdrop, GSK Consumer shareholders can take comfort in the fact that HUL is paying almost the market price of the shares as on date of announcement to acquire the company. The deal is valued at around 7.5 times GSK Consumer’s revenue of ₹4,300 crore for 2017 -18. In comparison, the recent acquisition of Heinz brands such as Complan , Glucon-D, Nycil and Sampriti by Zydus Wellness (which, however, are much smaller than GSK’s flagship Horlicks) was valued at four times the revenues of these brands.








 
 
Once the approvals (expected in a year) are got, shareholders of GSK Consumer, as on the record date, will be allotted HUL shares. With a diversified product portfolio across home care, personal care and foods, and market leadership in several categories, HUL is a probably a must-have bluechip stock for the long-term in any portfolio. Its wide reach as well as differentiated products across price points are a big positive. Expansion of product line from time to time to include premium products as well as the company’s pricing power to pass on any cost increases, constantly drive improvement in realisations and margins for the company.
Although HUL has perhaps paid top dollar for GSK Consumer, HUL investors can take comfort in the fact that the acquisition will be immediately EPS-accretive, despite the equity dilution from the share swap. Taking Bloomberg consensus earnings estimates for 2019-20 for both the companies, the EPS of the merged entity is expected to come in at ₹34.96.
Despite the equity dilution to the extent of 8 per cent at HUL following the merger, this expected EPS post-merger is higher than the ₹33.34 expected for HUL alone, without considering the merger.
Thus, the buyout is EPS-accretive, even without considering the synergies such as shared distribution network. Both companies enjoy overall operating margins of 18-20 per cent now. Synergies could further drive margins up. The GSK Consumer brands will give HUL a foot hold in a category it is not currently present in.
But even as GSK Consumer boasts of good volume growth of 8-16 per cent in recent quarters, the concern is that the growth in the health drinks industry (in which Horlicks is the market leader) is slowing.
 








 
The heath food drinks category has seen only 6 per cent growth annually in 2014-17, a slowdown from the 16 per cent annual growth in 2009-14, going by reports from several market research agencies. HUL, however, can turn the tide in its favour by improving the reach of GSK’s products, as it has three times wider reach than GSK Consumer’s.
The all-India penetration for drinks such as Horlicks is still only 24 per cent, with rural penetration being lower at 14 per cent. HUL also plans to leverage on the growing demand for premium health drinks through products such as Horlicks Cardia Plus or Horlicks Protein Plus.
Following the acquisition of GSK Consumer by Hindustan Unilever, shareholders of the former will get 4.39 shares of HUL for every share held."
17,2018-12-10,Unilever,"All you wanted to know about share swap
Last week, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) announced the merger of Glaxo SmithKline Consumer (GSK Consumer) with it, in a deal valuing the latter at ₹31,700 crore. The deal has been structured as a share swap, with shareholders of GSK Consumer being eligible to exchange each one of their shares for 4.39 shares in HUL on a decided record date.
What is it?
When a company pays for an acquisition by issuing its own shares to the shareholders of the target company, this is known as a share swap. The number of shares to be issued in lieu of their existing holdings in the target company — called the swap ratio — is determined by valuing the target company after looking into metrics such as its revenues and profits, as well as its market price. If the target company is listed, the market value of its shares is often a key consideration to arrive at the right price to be paid. Paying a premium to the market usually indicates healthy prospects and high potential, while a discount could indicate a distress sale.
The HUL-GSK Consumer deal is not the only one in recent times to be structured as a share swap. 
Why is it important?
A share swap has its advantages. As shareholders of the target company will also be shareholders of the merged entity, the risks and benefits of the expected synergy from the merger will be shared by both the parties. In a cash deal, if the acquirer has paid a premium and the synergies don’t materialise, shareholders of the acquiring company alone bear the fallout.
In a share swap, there is no cash outgo involved for the acquirer, saving the acquirer borrowing costs. Cash rich companies can put their cash to use for investments in the business or for other buyouts. On the flip side, issuing fresh shares could lead to reduction in promoter holding and dilution in earnings for shareholders of the acquiring company. However, the acquiring company can benefit from lower taxes, if there is goodwill created out of the merger which it writes off over the years. Goodwill arises when the acquisition price is higher than the value of assets and liabilities of the acquired company.
Why should I care?
If you are a shareholder in any of the companies that is part of such mergers or acquisitions, you then need to take a fresh look at the prospects of the stocks after the swap is announced. Take the HUL-GSK Consumer merger for instance. In this case, HUL is paying close to the market price of the GSK Consumer stock after consumer goods stocks have had a good run in the market. With a diversified product portfolio and market leadership in several categories, HUL has good long-term prospects too. Hence, GSK Consumer shareholders have got a fair deal.
Although HUL has perhaps paid top dollar for GSK Consumer, HUL investors can take comfort in the fact that the consideration is being paid, not in cash, but in highly priced HUL shares. The acquisition will immediately add to the EPS despite the equity dilution of about 8 per cent from the share swap.
Generally, these transactions take about a year to complete, needing the approval of creditors, stock exchanges, shareholders, Competition Commission and National Company Law Tribunal. The tax aspect also needs your attention. In case of a share swap, when shareholders of the acquired company are given shares of the acquirer company as part of the deal, this is not considered a transfer of shares. Hence, capital gains tax will not arise in the hands of the shareholders (including minority shareholders) of the acquired company. The tax liability will arise only when the shares of the merged entity are sold.
The bottomline
Acquisitions are dicey, but share swaps sweeten the deal."
16,2019-01-17,Unilever,"Strong rural demand led to double-digit volume growth
Despite a higher base in the quarter ended December 2017, Hindustan Unilever has put up a strong show in the December 2018 quarter.
With rural demand continuing to outpace urban, HUL has recorded a 10 per cent volume growth in this period. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth for the company.
After recording a zero per cent volume growth in the June 2017 quarter due to the GST transition, HUL’s volumes have grown at 10-12 per cent in each of the quarters beginning December 2017.
As against the 10 per cent volumes growth in the latest quarter, revenues grew at a higher 13 per cent to ₹9,357 crore, aided by price increases and superior product mix.
The topline growth was driven by a good performance by both home care and beauty and personal care segments. These segments, which together bring over 75 per cent of the revenues for the company, saw a 15 per cent and 11 per cent growth in revenues respectively.
Shifting preference to premium products in fabric and personal wash led the growth here.
Raw material, as a percentage of sales, stood at 48.4 per cent as against 47.5 per cent. But the company was able to expand its margins by partially passing on the increases and by reigning in advertising spends.
Ad expenses, as a percentage of sales, came in at 12.6 per cent in the quarter as against 13.3 per cent a year ago. Thanks to these measures, operating margin expanded by 190 basis points over the three months ended December 2017 to 21.4 per cent now.
Thus, despite a sharp rise in taxes and a fall in other income, the good operational performance helped net profits grow by 9 per cent to ₹1,444 crore.
Though the base effect for volumes may begin catching up in the quarters to come, the company expects demand to continue to be stable in the near term.
Even if rural demand were to be moderate, increasing preference of the urban consumer for premium and natural products may keep the volumes coming.
Preference for defensive FMCG stocks in the market volatility in the last one year coupled with strong demand has seen the HUL stock gain 26 per cent in this period. But this has led to the stock’s valuation expanding sharply to 65 times its trailing earnings now, higher than its historical 3-year average of 53 times.
With the stock perched on a high valuation, the upside may not be high from hereon. Nevertheless, with long-term prospects remaining sanguine, corrections due to market volatility may create buying opportunities."

We spoke to the management of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) for an update on the overall market conditions. Key takeaways:
a) A small short-term blip was seen in 4QFY19 demand. But, we had already built in 8 per cent volume growth for 4QFY19 versus double-digit growth of the preceding five quarters. 
b) Measures announced in the budget are expected to benefit demand from 1QFY20 onwards. We see no immediate threat to our FY20 forecast of 7.5 per cent volume growth.
c) We believe HUL will continue to outperform peers over the medium term.
 d) Material cost outlook remains benign, ad spends & promotion intensity have not picked up erratically and cost savings continue at the targeted pace.
 Valuation and view: There is no change to our forecasts. We expect its high multiples to sustain a) on combination of continued healthy volume growth versus peers; b) on better earnings growth versus its own past earnings; c) because of the company’s best-in-breed return ratios; and d) due to synergies from the GSKCH acquisition from FY21 (we are not building in benefit from the acquisition yet in our numbers). 
We maintain ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of ₹2,125, target multiple of 52x FY2021 EPS (which is aout 15 per cent premium to three-year average due to significantly improving business fundamentals)."
14,2019-05-05,Unilever,"Reality Check: HUL hurt by low volumes 
After a healthy volume growth of 10-12 per cent over the last five quarters, Hindustan Unilever recorded a slower volume growth of 7 per cent in the March 2019 quarter (over March 2018 quarter). The high base of last year, along with the slowdown in rural demand, hurt the company. Yet, it managed an 8.9 per cent growth in sales to ₹9,809 crore and a 13.8 per cent growth in profits to ₹1,538 crore, aided by better realisations and product mix, as well as lower input costs and advertising expenses. Thanks to these savings, operating margin expanded by 80 basis points over the three months-ended March 2018 to 23.3 per cent now. In the quarters to come, the moderation in rural demand and the base effect may continue to impact volumes. The stock now trades at 60 times its trailing 12-month earnings. Considering the weakening volumes and high valuation, the upside for the stock may be limited."

Producers of household items have been India’s best stock market bets for years. But the consumption slowdown in the world's fastest-growing major economy is rubbing the sheen off these shares.
The 74-member S&P BSE Fast-Moving Consumer Goods Index, which has had only one down year since 2006, has bucked the gains in the nation's benchmark measure. Some of the biggest names in the gauge have accumulated double-digit losses five months into the year.
The consumption engine is sputtering as the cash crunch caused by the crisis in the shadow-banking sector has curbed spending even on staples after hurting demand for cars and homes. Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), whose soaps and detergents are used by nine out of 10 Indian households, in an analysts call on Friday pinned the deceleration on weak rural demand and said it is unable to say when the buoyancy of the past would return.
When a generally-measured management like HUL’s uses the term recession in its comments in the post-result presser, it generally is not a one-quarter blip, analysts led by Rohit Chordia at Kotak Institutional Equity Research wrote in a note on the weekend.
The company’s volume growth slowed to seven per cent in the March quarter after five straight quarters of double-digit expansion. Growth for Dabur India Limited during the period was 4.3 per cent compared with about eight per cent a year earlier. Britannia Industries Limited grew seven per cent, versus 11 per cent, and Godrej Consumer Products Limited posted a one per cent increase in its domestic branded-business volumes.
The market is repricing the growth outlook. HUL has declined 5.8 per cent in 2019, Godrej Consumer 21 per cent, Britannia 15 per cent and Dabur 11 per cent. The S&P BSE Fast-Moving Consumer Index trades at a 12-month blended forward price-to-earning of 32, higher than its five-year average, signaling potential for further contraction in values."

Flagging Indian sales of products like toothpaste and hair oil have been a drag on the share prices of the nation’s consumer goods makers, but each dip is a buying opportunity for a fund manager who sees the slowdown in demand as temporary.
“The stocks offer stability and steady growth,” said Mahesh Patil, Co-chief Investment Officer at Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, which oversees assets of about $13 billion. “We don’t expect valuations to correct too much for consumer companies. They may consolidate a bit, but in a correction, we would look at them.”
Companies such as ITC Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd and Marico Ltd, which sell everything from grains to beverages to detergents, have lost their shine on the stock market as a cash squeeze caused by the crisis in some finance firms hurt demand even for staples."
9,2019-07-23,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever: Volumes slow, but cost control aids margins 




The effect of a high base as well as a slowdown in demand is visible in the tepid 5 per cent volume growth (year-on-year) recorded by Hindustan Unilever in the quarter ended June 2019. This is a further deterioration from the 7 per cent volume growth (year-on-year) seen in the March 2019 quarter and the double digit volume growth in the five quarters prior to that, beginning December 2017.
Despite the deterioration in volumes, few things stand out for the company. One, revenues grew higher than volumes at 6.7 per cent to ₹9,985 crore, thanks to a better product mix. The launch of premium and ‘natural’ range of products such as Sunlight liquid detergent, Lux Botanicals and Pears Naturale range of soaps as well as natural variants of Sunsilk shampoo helped. 
Secondly, though crude oil prices were volatile, benign prices of inputs such as palm oil aided margins a bit. Raw material costs as a percentage of sales stood at 45 per cent, a tad lower than the 45.8 per cent recorded a year ago. Thirdly, lower advertising expenses also improved profitability. Advertising expenses constituted just 11.6 per cent of sales, compared with 12.3 per cent earlier. Both these factors helped adjusted operating margins expand by 150 basis points over the June 2018 quarter to 26.2 per cent. Margin expansion was seen across home care (35 per cent of revenues), beauty and personal care (45 per cent ) as well as foods (20 per cent). 
Though depreciation and finance costs up sharply — the former due to an accounting adjustment - the improvement at the operating level helped the company record adjusted profit (adjusted for exception items) growth of 10.1 per cent to ₹1,755 crore.
According to HUL, rural sales, which were growing faster than urban in the last many quarters, has been growing only at par with urban in the last two quarters. 
Rural sales bring 40-45 per cent of revenues for the company. The moderation in rural demand as well the base effect may impact offtake in the near future. But increasing preference of the urban consumer for premium and natural products may aid volume growth and profitability to an extent."

 Hair-care brand Indulekha, acquired by Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) in 2016, has become a ₹2,000-crore brand for the FMCG major, its Chairman and MD, Sanjiv Mehta said. 
The offering under Indulekha include hair oils and hair cleansers (shampoos). 
Hinting that it was a successful acquisition, Mehta said, against the ₹350 crore paid three years back, Indulekha generated a business of ₹400 crore annually. Moreover, from a regional brand with strong presence in Southern markets, it has expanded pan-India. 
Indulekha, as on March 2015, generated a turnover ₹100 crore and had an EBITDA margin of 30 per cent. 
“Indulekha now generates at turnover of ₹400 crore annually and is a ₹,2000-crore brand for us,” he said during an event organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
Initially owned by the Kerala-based Moson Group, Indulekha was first launched in 2009 as a premium Ayurvedic hair oil. Over the years its ‘Bringha Oil’ carved out a niche for itself, in the premium naturals segment, supported by endorsements. The brand had a strong presence across Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. It had made a foray into Maharashtra at the time of acquisition by HUL. 
The acquisition marked HUL’s re-entry into the hair-oil space, a segment it had exited in 2006, sources say. 
Mehta, while sharing the story of Indulekha, pointed out that he had personally spoken to consumers before investing in the brand. Initially, when his team came with the acquisition offer, he was hesitant. “I had no touch and feel about the product,” Mehta said. 
During a trip to Chennai, he wanted to talk to consumers who had either used the brand or even “moved away from it”. 
“I spoke to 25 of them. I found that people who had moved away from it was because their need or requirement (hair fall prevention) had been fulfilled. So I came back and told my team, tell me which cheque you want me to sign and what amount do I need to put in,” Mehta added."

 FMCG bellwether Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has cut prices across some of its product portfolios to pass on the benefit of softening input costs. 
“HUL does selective and judicious price changes across its portfolio in the normal course of its business. Given that the commodity prices are expected to remain benign for certain time period, we have taken price reductions in range of 4-6 per cent in Lux and Lifebuoy portfolio while it may be higher on certain packs in order to pass on the benefits to the consumers,” said Company Spokesperson.
Last month, during the post-results analysts call, the company management had called out the possibility of reducing prices. “That’s really passing on the right value equation given that the commodity is expected to remain benign for a certain period of time. And it’s only rightful to pass on some of these benefits to the consumers,” Srinivas Phatak, CFO, HUL, had said on July 23, 2019. 
“We are making certain decisive interventions, whether it is on products, whether it’s on proposition, whether it’s on price. So when we have looked at all of those levers, we have taken a view of what is the outlook for the commodity. We have taken the potential on cost, which is coming from what has happened to the budget. Factoring all of those into account, we are still in a position to actually take down the pricing, give the right value equation to the consumer and drive growth into this,”Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman, CEO and MD, HUL, had said. 
Hindustan Unilever, the country’s largest consumer goods company, had reported its lowest volume growth in seven quarters during the April-June period (Q1FY20) on the back of slowing consumer demand. HUL saw 5 per cent volume growth as against 12 per cent in the year-ago period. This was the second straight quarter when HUL has posted single-digit volume growth. In the March quarter, volume growth was 7 per cent."
5,2019-08-28,Unilever,"Soap makers reduce prices to boost sales 
 Leading soap manufacturers have slashed prices on their products following lower palm oil prices to tackle muted growth in the sector.

 “HUL does selective and judicious price changes across its portfolio in the normal course of its business. Given that the commodity prices are expected to remain benign for certain time period, we have taken price reductions in range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent in Lux and Lifebuoy portfolio, while it may be higher on certain packs in order to pass on the benefits to the consumers,” HUL said in a statement.
 Wipro Consumer Care, makers of Santoor soap, has also slashed the prices.
 “...we have also cut prices in soaps, passing on the benefit of lower raw material prices to the consumer. We believe this will help increase consumption,” said Wipro Consumer Care president (India consumer care business) Anil Chugh.
 Kolkata-based multi-conglomerate ITC also cut prices due to lower raw material cost about 5-6 weeks back.
 “ITC passed on the benefit of lower raw material costs to consumers through a downward revision in prices about 5-6 weeks back in certain packs of its soap variants,” said an ITC spokesperson.
 Data analytics firm Nielsen, in a report, had last month said that in April-June quarter, sales of FMCG items, including soaps, have slowed down.
 “... this quarter has witnessed a slowdown across all food as well as non-food categories with Salty Snacks, Biscuits, Spices, Toilet Soaps, and Packaged tea leading the slowdown,” Nielsen had said."

For many manufacturing companies, the savings on this front could give them room to reduce prices or improve other spends, thereby spurring demand. Many companies in sectors such as infrastructure, capital goods and FMCG stand to gain. Some others in the auto, steel, oil and gas, and real-estate segments could also get a leg-up. IT companies may be better off under the current regime though, given the lower tax incidence at present.
Most companies in the information technology space will not be enthused by the corporate tax rate cuts announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. There are two reasons. Many companies have an effective corporate tax rate below 25.17 per cent (including surcharge and cess) and they get the benefit of profit-based deductions for exporting their services from special economic zones in India.
Also, IT and software companies that build their own intellectual property get a weighted deduction under the income-tax laws on the R&D expenses that they have incurred to build their IP.
Now, such companies might have to pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) calculated on their book profits.
The Finance Minister has slashed MAT from 18.5 per cent to 15 per cent. That puts the effective tax rate, including surcharge, for companies paying MAT at 17.5 per cent compared with 21.6 per cent earlier.
This means that IT companies that get tax deductions on their export revenues earned from operating in SEZs, and pay MAT, wouldn’t want to opt out of claiming these deductions. They would also have to forego the weighted deduction on R&D that brings down the effective corporate tax rate.
Besides, if they opt for the lower effective corporate tax rate of 25.2 per cent, they will have to take a one-time charge of any MAT credit that might be in their books.
In 2018-19, out of the top-tier IT companies in the S&P BSE IT Index, only Infosys (26 per cent) had an effective tax rate of over 25 per cent at the standalone level, while TCS (21.3 per cent), HCL Technologies (23.7 per cent), Wipro (23.02 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (19.6 per cent) had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
Even most mid-tier IT companies such as Mphasis (20.5 per cent), Hexaware (22.3 per cent), Mindtree (24.9 per cent), L&T Infotech (21.7 per cent) and L&T Technology Services (24.2 per cent), had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
In all, IT companies won’t be rushing to opt out of their export-based tax incentives until the benefit of paying lower taxes on export revenues runs out.
With major players such as Hindustan Unilever, Nestle, Britannia, GSK Consumer and Colgate-Palmolive suffering an effective tax of 32-36 per cent, the FMCG segment could be a beneficiary of the new 25.17 per cent tax rate.
At the same time, home-grown companies such as Dabur, Jyothy Labs, Godrej Consumer, Bajaj Consumer and Marico may not choose to move to the new regime, considering that their effective tax rates are either on a par with or lower than 25.17 per cent.
Overall, for shareholders in FMCG stocks, this move could result in the 2018-19 profits of listed FMCG players, on an aggregate, inching up by 9 per cent.
However, FMCG companies can choose to retain a portion of the benefits to increase advertising spends and/or pass it on as price cuts to boost demand. In the quarter-ended June 2019, for instance, major FMCG companies clocked single-digit growth in sales due to poor volumes.
Going by the 2018-19 numbers, Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motors and Maruti Suzuki and Eicher Motors have an effective tax rate of 29-33 per cent and could benefit from the reduced rates. However, the rates of Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland, are much lower. Taking M&M ‘s reported tax expenses (standalone) for 2018-19, the effective tax rate is only at 24.17 per cent (21.3 per cent, considering the current year's tax expense alone).
The company also has a MAT credit of ₹1,116.35 crore in its books as on March 31, 2019. Ashok Leyland’s effective tax rate, given the reported tax expense for 2018-19, is 20.6 per cent (15.14 per cent taking the current year's expense alone). The company has availed itself of benefit to the extent of ₹233 crore on tax concessions and tax holidays in 2018-19 and has MAT credit on its books.
In such cases, companies may choose to continue under the current regime till the tax holiday/concessions exist. Since MAT also continues at a reduced rate of 15 per cent, these companies can choose to pay tax as per normal rates or as per MAT, whichever is higher — as has been the case until now. MAT credit can also be set off against the tax liability in future years.
Among auto ancillaries, MNC players such as SKF India, Goodyear and Bosch that have high effective tax rates of 33-36 per cent could be major beneficiaries. Put together, listed companies in the auto and auto ancillaries space may see a 3-5 per cent addition to their profits of 2018-19, if they choose to avail themselves of the 25.17 per cent tax rate.
For infrastructure companies, the effective tax rates in FY19, after taking into account all eligible exemptions and tax holidays, work out to 27-35 per cent of their standalone PBT. For companies such as Engineers India, Ircon International, Ashoka Buildcon and RITES, availing themselves of the lower tax rate of 25.17 per cent could translate to a 14-18 per cent jump in earnings, going forward. Whereas, giants such as Larsen & Toubro and IRB Infra developers could witness only a 2 and 5 per cent rise in PAT led by tax savings.
Among the pure construction players, NCC, Welspun and Sadhbav Engg could benefit. Certain companies have effective tax rates of less than 25 per cent, which can be on account of payment of minimum alternate tax, or availing themselves of benefits of differential depreciation on fixed assets under the IT Act. The effects of the amendments announced will hence have to be evaluated on a case-to-case basis.
For instance, Dilip Buildcon has an effective tax rate of 16 per cent in FY19 on account of MAT provisions (inferred from the annual report). Hence, the lowered MAT rates could bring down its effective tax rate further, and the company would also get the existing MAT credit entitlement.
On the other hand, Adani Port and SEZ now enjoy an effective tax rate of 21 per cent, after availing itself of deductions under Section 80IAB of the Income Tax Act for 10 years, with effect from FY07-08. This apart, it has several subsidiaries and joint ventures that can get tax holiday benefits under Section 80IA.
The company is also likely to benefit from the grandfathering of taxes on buyback, as the management had made a public announcement of the share buyback of ₹1,960 crore on June 4, 2019.
Among the cement manufacturers, the effective tax rate in FY19 for most companies (on a standalone basis) is less than 25 per cent — they may refrain from foregoing their exemptions and deductions. This includes large players like Ultratech and Shree Cement. However, there could be savings in PAT in the range of 11-15 per cent for Himadri, Deccan and India Cements if they opt for the subsidised rates, as their current effective tax rate is more than 25.17 per cent.
The impact of the lower corporate tax on the steel industry is expected to be mixed, at least in the near future.
The tax incidence on companies such as Tata Steel, Kalyani Steels and Jindal Stainless Hisar in FY19 was 39 per cent, 33 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively. Note that these are the tax rates after taking into account the tax exemptions that the companies are eligible for. Thus, these companies stand to gain in a big way if they opt for the reduced tax rate of 22 per cent (25.17 per cent including surcharge and cess).
Companies such as JSW Steel and Tata Metaliks with effective tax rates of 20 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, may not opt for the reduced tax rate immediately. Meanwhile, SAIL, Jindal Steel and Uttam Galva had zero current tax for FY19. This could be either due to companies making losses in FY19 or accumulated losses from previous years, setting off the year’s profits. If the new reduced tax rate is opted, setting-off of losses will not be possible, making it unattractive. However, in the long run, when the companies turn profitable or become eligible to pay MAT, they can opt for the new tax rates, which could reduce their tax outgo.
The move to reduce corporate tax seems largely positive for real-estate companies reeling under pressure due to tight liquidity in the market. For most realty companies, the effective tax rate is higher than 25.17 per cent (including cess and surcharge), based on standalone profit before tax. For instance, for Oberoi Realty and Ashiana Housing, the current tax rate is 29 per cent, while for Kolte-Patil, it works out to around 45 per cent.
These companies, if they adopt the new corporate tax regime, could improve their earnings, even if they forego their exemptions and MAT credit.
If players pass on the benefit to home buyers, it could spur demand in the market.
But for companies such as Sunteck Realty and Prestige Estate Properties, for which the effective current year tax rates work out to less than 5 per cent, and Brigade Enterprises and Sobha with 23 per cent rate, continuing with the existing tax structure may be better.
For the oil and gas sector, the cut in corporate tax rate seems largely positive. Going by their FY19 standalone financials, the effective tax rate for most companies in the sector is higher than the 25.17 per cent rate (including surcharge and cess) that will apply to them now. For instance, in FY19, the current tax provision of city gas distributors Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas was about 31 per cent of their profit before tax.
The effective tax rate for the PSU hydrocarbon explorers, ONGC and Oil India, and gas transmitter GAIL (India) was 27-28 per cent, while it was about 29 per cent for PSU refiner HPCL. The highest tax rate — about 32 per cent — was borne by Gujarat-based gas transmitter GSPL. For the above companies, the new tax rate of 22 per cent plus surcharge of 10 per cent and cess of 4 per cent — totalling 25.17 per cent — should translate into lower tax outgo. Even if these companies have to give up some investment-based tax exemptions and credit of minimum alternate tax carried forward from earlier years, they should be better off under the new tax rate regime.
On the other hand, there are a few companies such as Reliance Industries, PSU refiners Indian Oil and BPCL, and gas importer Petronet LNG that may not benefit from the new tax rate. In FY19, the current tax provision of Reliance Industries, Indian Oil and BPCL was about 20 per cent of their profit before tax — this is lower than the new effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
It is the same case for Petronet LNG, which had an effective tax rate of about 24 per cent last year. For these companies, it may be worthwhile continuing with their existing tax structure, taking the benefits, if any, of investment-based tax exemptions, and carried forward MAT credit and carried forward loss.
In the case of Reliance Industries, for instance, while the applicable tax rate in FY19 was 34.94 per cent, it was able to reduce the effective rate (excluding deferred tax adjustments) to about 20 per cent, thanks to exempted income, and additional allowances net of MAT credit.
The company may likely find it more beneficial to continue with this arrangement until the tax breaks that keep the effective tax low are exhausted.
Later, it could shift to the new regime with the effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman opened the liquidity tap for corporates on Friday by announcing a sharp tax cut and leaving more money in their hands for capacity expansion. The statutory tax rate for corporates has been lowered to 22 per cent from 30 per cent. This benefit, though, is only for companies that wish to give up their tax exemptions. Given that most tax incentives and exemptions have been phased out over the past few years, companies may prefer to forego the few they enjoy now, and opt to be taxed at the lower rate of 22 per cent.
New manufacturing companies incorporated after October 1, 2019, can benefit from an even lower rate of 15 per cent tax if they don’t claim the tax benefits they are eligible for. India Inc will also get relief on MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax). The Finance Minister has reduced MAT to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent. This would benefit companies located in SEZ developers, infrastructure, cement companies, companies with units in specified locations in the North-East and exporters. There is also relief on buyback tax.
The 20 per cent tax on buybacks by corporates, which was announced in the Budget on July 5, 2019, would not apply to companies that announced them before the Budget day. According to data from nseinfobase.com, companies, including Sasken Technologies, Greaves Cotton, Welspun Corp, Star Cement and Eris Lifesciences, whose issues are on the way, but were announced before July 5, and for companies such as Infosys, which had buybacks ongoing in July, will benefit from the change. Wipro is also set to benefit as it announced its buyback on June 5.
Companies that pay corporate taxes under the new rates of 15 and 22 per cent will be charged a flat surcharge of 10 per cent, irrespective of their taxable income. The companies that choose the existing regime, availing exemptions and deductions, will have to pay a surcharge only if their total income exceeds ₹1 crore. The rates of surcharge for them will continue to be at 7 per cent and 12 per cent, for total income between ₹1 crore and ₹10 crore and more than ₹10 crore, respectively.
The stock market on Friday cheered the Finance Minister’s move to cut taxes. While companies that are currently paying lower rates due to various deductions and exemptions, such as many information technology players, are unlikely to shift to the new regime, there are many companies across sectors that are likely to see their tax incidence move lower, thus translating to higher profits. If the lower tax incidence is passed on to customers in the form of price cuts, it can help spur demand.
 








 
Ever since the late Finance Minister Arun Jaitley kick-started the process of a phased reduction in corporate tax in 2016-17 and elimination of exemptions, the effective tax rate for India Inc has only gone up.
This is because, while smaller companies were given the benefit of a lower tax rate each year, the phasing out of some tax deductions began impacting the tax outgo of larger companies.
Further, in 2015-16, the Finance Minister also increased the surcharge on corporate tax. That year, for companies with income of up to ₹10 crore, the surcharge was increased to 7 per cent from 5 per cent, and for firms with income above ₹10 crore, it was increased to 12 per cent from 10 per cent. Thus, the effective tax rate in 2017-18 came to 29.49 per cent; it was 23.22 per cent in 2013-14. This increase — evident in the numbers of the past one year — was due to larger companies coughing up more.
In 2017-18, the effective tax rate for companies making profit of more than ₹500 crore was 26.3 per cent; in 2016-17, it was 23.94 per cent. The effective tax rate for smaller companies making profit of ₹1-10 crore came down to 27.38 per cent from 29.2 per cent. So far, withdrawal of tax exemptions has made the effective tax rate of larger companies move higher. It is from here on that these companies will start benefiting.
Now, all companies that are willing to give up their tax incentives can pay taxes at a fairly lower rate of 22 per cent.
 
India is now among the countries that have a low corporate tax rate, and can compete better globally. For the current year, KPMG data show that the statutory tax rate in Myanmar is 25 per cent; in Malaysia, it is 24 per cent; 25 per cent in Indonesia and Korea and 28 per cent in Sri Lanka. Even Chinese companies cough up more — as they pay a tax of 25 per cent — and in Brazil, it is 34 per cent.
The global average corporate tax rate is 23.79 now, and the Asian average is 21.09 per cent. That said, the current move to cut taxes is going to make a hole in the government’s tax kitty. Last year, as per the Budget estimates, the revenue foregone by the Centre on various tax incentives was ₹1.08-lakh crore. Now, with tax cuts, there will be an additional revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore.
 
Bond investors who have been basking in the double-digit return glory over the past year may be in for a bumpy ride ahead. While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s corporate tax rate cut has cheered India Inc and the equity market, the move is a dampener for bond markets.
This is because the revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore owing to the cut will throw the Centre’s fiscal deficit target off track. The RBI’s surplus transfer to the Centre, at best, makes up for the existing shortfall in income tax and GST collections. While higher proceeds from disinvestment and some tax buoyancy (towards the end of the fiscal), on account of the growth-boosting measures, can aid revenues, for now, the ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue loss appears to have left a big hole in the Centre’s kitty. The fiscal deficit target could well move up to 4 per cent (from the projected 3.3 per cent), implying additional borrowings.
Based on the Controller General of Accounts’ (CGA) provisional figures for FY19 (in which income tax grew by a modest 7 per cent), the estimated growth in income tax collections for FY20 works out to 23 per cent. For April-July, CGA data suggest that the growth in net income tax was just about 6 per cent. There is also a significant shortfall in GST collections.
The surplus transfer by the RBI as recommended by the Bimal Jalan Committee has offered a much-needed respite to the Centre in the current fiscal. Excluding the ₹28,000-crore interim dividend already paid by the RBI to the Centre last fiscal, the net transfer in the current financial year amounts to ₹1,48,051 crore. But while optically, the surplus transfer appears to be a massive figure, essentially, it is about ₹60,000 crore above what was estimated in the Budget. Hence, this additional bonanza can help make good the shortfall in tax revenues.
On the disinvestment front, the Centre has set a target of ₹1.05-lakh crore (above the ₹85,000 crore achieved the previous year), which may be achievable. But given that the Centre has been missing its target on spectrum, it is unlikely to meet its estimate of ₹50,500 crore for FY20.
On balance, before the corporate tax rate cut, the Centre could have still pulled off the 3.3 per cent (risk of missing GDP growth assumptions though remained). The substantial ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue foregone on account of the corporate tax rate cut is an additional burden for the Centre that can take its fiscal deficit target to 4 per cent levels.
The joker in the pack is still the underlying growth in the economy. While the real GDP growth has fallen from 8 per cent last year to 5 per cent this fiscal in the April-June quarter, the sharp fall in nominal GDP growth from 12.6 per cent to 8 per cent during this period is worrisome.
The Centre’s fiscal deficit target assumes a 11 per cent growth in nominal GDP growth for FY20 (from the Central Statistics Office’s FY19 estimates), which is a tall task. If growth falters further, the fiscal deficit target can even move beyond 4 per cent levels.
The biggest overhang for Indian bond markets has been the huge gross market borrowings by the Centre pegged at a high ₹7.1-lakh crore in the current fiscal (from ₹5.71-lakh crore last year). But given that the borrowing calendar has been front-loaded, the market was factoring in the easing of supply of bonds in the second half of the fiscal.
For the April-September 2019 period, issuance of government securities amounts to ₹4.42-lakh crore; the balance ₹2.68-lakh crore of gross borrowings will come in the second half. But the supply of bonds in the second half could go up now. The stimulus announced by the Centre would lead to additional borrowings, which implies more supply of bonds and higher yields (bond prices and yields are inversely related).
Going ahead with the foreign sovereign bond issuance could be a saving grace. The ₹70,000-odd crore of foreign sovereign bonds pegged in by most economists can help lower bond yields in the domestic market.
Even though the RBI cut its policy repo rate by a notable 35 basis points in its August policy, Indian bond yields have only inched up. From 6.3 per cent levels in the beginning of August, the yield on 10-year government bonds has increased to 6.6 per cent levels, already factoring in expectations of a fiscal stimulus from the Centre. Post the FM’s move on corporate tax rate, the yield has moved up by another 20 basis points.
Given that expectations of fiscal slippage has been factored into bond yields to some extent, bond yields could remain range-bound in the near term, until there is more clarity on foreign sovereign bond issuance, GST collections and the disinvestment agenda. Expectations of the RBI cutting rates further, given the sanguine inflation trends, may also cap the upside in bond yields. That said, notable rise in yields cannot be ruled out in the coming months, given the significant slip on fiscal deficit and volatile rupee.
Given the uncertainty around various factors impacting bond yields, investors must cap their expectations and tread with caution. Long-term gilt funds as a category has delivered 15-16 per cent returns over the past year, thanks to the sharp rise in bond prices. A rise in yield (fall in prices) hereon can impact returns.
Hence, investors should avoid duration and credit risk in their portfolio. A chunk of your debt fund investments should be in short-term debt funds that carry less volatility in returns. Short- and medium-duration debt funds having a duration of up to 3-4 years are ideal for investors with medium risk appetite. Opt for corporate bond funds that invest a chunk of their assets in high-rated debt instruments."
3,2019-10-14,Unilever,"HUL Q2 standalone net profit rises 21.18 per cent to Rs 1,848 cr 
FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Monday reported a 21.18 per cent rise in standalone net profit to Rs 1,848 crore for the quarter ended on September 30, 2019, mainly driven by the home care, beauty and personal care verticals.
The company had posted a net profit of Rs 1,525 crore for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, HUL said in a filing to BSE.
Standalone sales during the quarter under review stood at Rs 9,708 crore as against Rs 9,138 crore for the same period a year ago.
“Amidst a challenging market environment, HUL has delivered another quarter of resilient performance and sustained margin improvement. Our focus on consumer value, excellence in execution and market development continues to serve us well,” HUL Chairman and Managing Director, Sanjiv Mehta, said.
The near-term outlook for demand, especially in rural India, remains challenging, he added.
The revenue from the home care segment rose to Rs 3,371 crore in July-September 2019, from Rs 3,080 crore in the year-ago quarter, according to the filing.
The beauty and personal care segment revenue increased to Rs 4,543 crore in the quarter under review from Rs 4,316 crore in the same period of last year.
The revenue of the foods & refreshment segment stood at Rs 1,847 crore in July-September 2019, against Rs 1,704 crore in the same quarter of last year.
The board of directors has declared an interim dividend of Rs 11 per share for the year ending March 31, 2020, the company said.
Shares of HUL Ltd closed at Rs 2,014.70 on the BSE, up 0.50 per cent from the previous close."
2,2019-10-15,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever Q2 result: The juggernaut rolls on 
BL Research Bureau 
Amid the ongoing consumption slowdown, HUL Hindustan Unilever has managed to hold its head above the water, recording a volume growth of 5 per cent YoY in Q2 FY20. While the double digit volume growth recorded for the five quarters from December 2017 to December 2018 gave way to single digit growth of 7 per cent in three months ended March 2019, volume growth further deteriorated to 5 per cent in the April-June 2019 period. That the company has been able to maintain the same growth rate in volumes in the September 2019 quarter is a positive.
With HUL deriving 40-45 per cent revenues from rural sales, the slowdown in the rural economy has been impacting volumes in the last two or three quarters. According to HUL, rural sales, which were growing faster than urban earlier, grew only at par with urban in the June 2019 quarter and further deteriorated to 0.4 times urban sales in the July-September 2019 period.
Amid tepid rural demand, the focus on the urban consumer, lower raw material costs, price cuts in select categories such as cleansing and higher ad spends have helped keep demand afloat. As against the volume growth of 5 per cent, the company’s topline grew at 6.2 per cent to ₹9,708 crore.
Despite price cuts taken in the personal cleansing brands such as Lifebuoy and Lux, better product mix helped major segments such as home care and beauty & personal care show revenue growth of 5-9 per cent. The categories also benefited from launches such as Love & Care premium fabric wash, Pears Naturale Bodywash, and Pond’s Superlight gel.
Raw material cost as a percentage of sales came down to 48.1 per cent, from 49.5 per cent a year ago. Employee expenses also dropped a bit. These not only helped price cuts in select products but also enabled slightly higher advertising spends. As a percentage of sales, ad spends came in at 12.3 per cent in the quarter, up by 20 basis points vis-à-vis June 2018 quarter. Operating margins came in at 24.7 per cent, about 200 basis points higher than in the three months ended June 2018. Profits ( before exceptional items) grew by 20 per cent to Rs 1832 crore. Apart from strong operating performance, this growth was also aided by cut in corporate tax rate. Effective rate for the quarter stood at approximately 22 per cent, as against the statutory rate of 25.2 per cent.
Thanks to its resilience, the HUL stock has moved up by 30 per cent in the last year. It now trades at a rich PE of 69 times its trailing-12 month earnings. In the quarters to come, benefits from the corporate tax cuts could continue to give elbow room for the company to push up volumes through price cuts and ad spends. The company expects effective tax rate for FY20 at 27 per cent, compared with 30.5 per cent in FY19.
