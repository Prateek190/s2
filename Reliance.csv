Reliance Jio has reportedly had a soft launch of the enterpriseservices, with commercial rollout expected to follow


After capturing the mobile data market, Reliance Jio Infocomm is looking to enter the next major bastion held by incumbent telecom operators — enterprise services.
RJio has reportedly had a soft launch of the services, with commercial rollout expected to follow. This will result in a head-on collision with the existing players, who have already blamed the new entrant for the sector’s mounting debt and losses.
“RJio is in the final phases of testing its enterprise offering, which is the definite logical step in its growth path. With most of the infrastructure, including optical fibre cables (OFC), towers and data centres, in place, it’s only a matter of time before the services go live,” a source close to the development told BusinessLine.
RJio, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries, conducted a soft launch of the services this week and demonstrated the services, said another source.
The company is looking to offer unified communications, Multiprotocol Label Switching (a protocol for high-speed telecom traffic) networks, Internet Protocol-Virtual Private Networks , cloud services and managed video-conferencing, among others.
RJio, which already has about 1 lakh telecom towers and more than 2 lakh route km of fibre, will use these infrastructure to service corporate clients, which are mainly customers with high average revenue per user (ARPU).
Further, the company will also utilise the recently acquired assets of Reliance Communications for its enterprise foray. Industry sources and certain channel partners also confirmed Rjio’s enterprise foray, while that of the soft launch could not be separately verified. An email sent to RJio went unanswered as of press time on Friday.
On December 28, 2017, Mukesh Ambani-led RJio had announced the acquisition of the wireless assets of debt-laden RCom, controlled by his younger sibling Anil.
RJio bought more than 43,000 towers, 1.78-lakh route km of OFC network, spectrum in 800, 900, 1,800 and 2,100 MHz bands, and 248 Media Convergence Nodes.
On Friday, RJio slashed tariffs by ₹50 for its 1 GB per day pack, and announced 50 per cent additional data on its 1.5 GB per day packs.
With the reduction, Jio’s unlimited monthly pack will now be priced at ₹149, the lowest tariff in the industry. The company is also providing 50 per cent more data benefits on its ₹198, ₹398, ₹448 and ₹498 packs."
254,2018-01-08,Reliance,"Seven of 10 most valued companies see Rs 26,971-cr drop in m-cap
The combined market valuation of seven of the 10 most valued companies dropped by Rs 26,970.7 crore last week. At the end of the trading week on Friday, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDFC Bank, ITC, HUL, Maruti Suzuki India, SBI and Infosys were the ones to suffer losses in their market valuation, while Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), HDFC and ONGC made gains.
Maruti’s market capitalisation (m-cap) plunged Rs 8,980.84 crore to Rs 2,84,983.84 crore. The m-cap of Infosys slumped Rs 5,940.34 crore to Rs 2,21,037.56 crore and that of HDFC Bank dipped Rs 3,393.06 crore to Rs 4,81,879.55 crore. TCS’s valuation slipped by Rs 3,053.29 crore to Rs 5,13,880.93 crore and that of SBI declined by Rs 2,848.57 crore to Rs 2,64,313.49 crore. The m-cap of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) fell by Rs 2,510.79 crore to Rs 2,93,611.52 crore and that of ITC went down by Rs 243.81 crore to Rs 3,20,487.11 crore.
On the other hand, ONGC added Rs 3,914.14 crore to reach Rs 2,53,713.06 crore in valuation. HDFC’s mcap jumped Rs 2,484.25 crore to Rs 2,75,736.30 crore and that of RIL advanced Rs 1,235.03 crore to Rs 5,84,582.37 crore.
In the ranking of top-10 firms, RIL stood at number one position, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, ITC, HUL, Maruti, HDFC, SBI, ONGC and Infosys. During the first week of 2018, the Sensex notched up a rise of 97.02 points, or 0.28 per cent, while the broader Nifty gained 28.15 points, or 0.26 per cent."
253,2018-01-08,Reliance,"Weekly Trading Guide: SBI, ITC, Infosys, Tata Steel, RIL


ITC seeks for a direction


ITC is stuck in a narrow range for the third consecutive week. The support at ₹260 and resistance at ₹267 are key levels to watch in the coming days. A breakout on either side of these two levels will decide the next leg of move for the stock and give a cue on the upcoming trend. If the stock sustains above ₹260 and breaks above ₹267 decisively, the downside pressure will ease. Such a break can take it higher to ₹272 and will also give an early indication that the downtrend that has been in place since July 2017 could be ending. A decisive break and close above ₹272 will confirm the trend reversal and can target ₹277 and ₹280 thereafter. But if ITC declines below ₹260, it can dip to test the significant support level of ₹257. A further fall below ₹257 will then increase the possibility of the stock extending its down-move towards ₹252. Traders can hold the long positions and accumulate on dips at ₹257. Retain the stop-loss at ₹254 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹270.


Infosys can dip ahead of results


After a strong rally for four consecutive weeks, Infosys fell sharply last week by 2.6 per cent. Support is at ₹1,010. A break below it will increase the likelihood of the stock extending its current down-move to ₹980 or ₹975 this week, well ahead of the third quarter results announcement on Friday. The outcome of the quarterly results will then determine the next trend for the stock. If Infosys manages to bounce from ₹980-₹975, an upmove to ₹1,010 will be possible. But a fall below ₹975 can drag the stock further lower to ₹950 levels. On the other hand, if the stock sustains above ₹1,010 this week, a bounce to ₹1,035 and ₹1,045 is possible again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹1,010 and ₹1,045 can be seen for some time. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹1,045 is now needed for the stock to gain fresh momentum and rally further. The next target above ₹1,045 is ₹1,070. Investors can hold the long positions and can accumulate if the stock falls towards ₹980 in the coming days.


RIL is stuck in a narrow range


RIL has been stuck in a narrow range over the last couple of weeks. The immediate outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹908 and resistance is at ₹937. A breakout on either side of ₹908 or ₹937 will determine the next trend. Until then the stock can continue to trade sideways between ₹908 and ₹937. A strong break above ₹937 can ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take the stock higher to the crucial resistance level of ₹960. A strong break above ₹960 can boost the momentum and take the stock further higher to ₹1,000 levels thereafter. On the other hand, if RIL declines below ₹937 in the coming days, a fall to ₹895 or ₹890 is possible. A break below ₹890 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹880 or ₹875. As being reiterated over the last few weeks, the region between ₹880 and ₹875 is a crucial support zone. A decisive break below ₹875 will increase the possibility of a double-top reversal pattern on the chart. In such a scenario, the possibility of the stock falling to ₹854 will increase.


Short-term view is bearish for SBI


SBI fell last week as expected to touch a low of ₹301.65. Though it managed to reverse higher from the week’s low, the bounce-back move lacks strength. The stock made a high of ₹311.8 on Friday and came off from there to close 1 per cent lower. The short-term outlook remains bearish. A cluster of resistances in the broad ₹310-₹320 region can cap the upside in the short term. An intermediate bounce to this resistance zone if seen can see fresh sellers coming into the market. A fall to ₹294 or ₹292 is likely in the coming days. A strong break below ₹292 will increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹285. Traders who have taken short positions last week can hold them. Add more short positions at ₹314 if an intermediate bounce breaking above ₹310 is seen in the near term. Retain the stop-loss at ₹317 for the target of ₹294. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹305 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹299. The outlook will turn positive only on a strong break above ₹320. But such a strong move looks less probable.


Uptrend is intact in Tata Steel


Tata Steel rose for the third consecutive week and was up over 5 per cent last week. The strong surge rally last week strengthens the overall uptrend. Support at ₹735 can limit the downside in the near term. Dips to this support may find fresh buyers coming into the market. The downside could be limited to the next significant support levels of ₹715 and ₹690 even if the stock declines, breaking below ₹735. But such a fall looks less likely. As such, the possibility of the stock sustaining above ₹735 is high . A rally to ₹800 is likely. A strong break above ₹800 will increase the likelihood of the up-move extending to ₹825 and ₹850 levels. An intermediate pull-back move from ₹850 levels to ₹800 or ₹750 cannot be ruled out. But the overall uptrend will continue to remain intact. Tata Steel is now all set to revisit ₹930 and ₹950 levels from a medium to long-term perspective. Investors can hold the long positions. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹640. Consider booking partial profits around ₹900 levels."
252,2018-01-14,Reliance,"Weekly trading guide: SBI, ITC, Infosys, RIL, Tata Steel
SBI (₹301.8) fell for the third consecutive week. The stock was down 1.4 per cent last week. The near-term outlook remains bearish. A fall below ₹300 towards ₹296 and ₹294 is likely in the coming days. If SBI manages to reverse higher from around ₹294, a relief rally to ₹300 is possible initially. A break above ₹300 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹305 or even ₹310 thereafter. But if SBI breaks decisively below ₹294, there is a strong likelihood of the downmove extending further to ₹285. The region around ₹285 is a key short-term support with the potential to halt the current downmove. A strong upward reversal from around ₹285 will increase the possibility of the stock rallying towards ₹300 or even higher thereafter. As such the price action around ₹285 will need a close watch to get a cue on the next leg of move. Traders can hold the short positions. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹310. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹303 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹299 for the target of ₹294.
ITC (₹267.5) surged over 4 per cent intra-week, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹267 and made a high of ₹273.8 last week. However, it fell back from the week’s high giving back most of the gains to close the week just 1.7 per cent higher. Immediate support is at ₹266. If ITC manages to reverse higher again from this support in the coming days, it can strengthen the bullish momentum and go to ₹272 and ₹273 levels again. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹273 will then pave the way for the next target of ₹280. Even if the stock breaks below ₹266 this week, the next significant supports between ₹264 and ₹263 and then at ₹260 can limit the downside. The outlook will turn bearish only if ITC declines decisively below ₹260, which looks less probable at the moment. Traders can hold the long positions with the revised stop-loss at ₹265 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹268 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹272. Short-term traders who do not hold any positions can initiate fresh long positions at current levels and also accumulate on dips at ₹264. Keep the stop-loss at ₹259 for the target of ₹280. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹270 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹274.
The prolonged wait is over. Infosys (₹1,078.4) finally cleared the key hurdle of ₹1,045 after struggling for over 14 months. The stock surged over 6 per cent last week to close on a strong note above ₹1,045. This gives an initial confirmation that the downtrend that was in place since June 2016 has reversed. Infosys is now all set to target ₹1,350 over the long-term. A near-term dip to ₹1,050-₹1,045 cannot be ruled out before the stock extends its upmove. Strong support is now available in the broad ₹1,045-₹1,000 region. Only a decisive fall below ₹1,000 will turn the outlook bearish. But such a break is unlikely as any intermediate dips in the stock will now attract fresh buyers. Next resistance is at ₹1,120 which is likely to be tested in the short-term. A strong break above ₹1,120 will then clear the way for the next target of ₹1,200 over the medium-term. Investors can hold the long positions. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go long on dips at ₹1,060 and accumulate at ₹1,050. Keep the stop-loss at ₹980 for the target of ₹1,180.
RIL (₹946.7) surged breaking above the key resistance level of ₹937 last week. The stock was up 2.6 per cent last week. The region between ₹937 and ₹935 will now serve as a strong support for the stock in the near-term. As long as the stock remains above this support zone, there is a strong likelihood of it rallying to test the crucial resistance level of ₹960 in the coming days. Whether it breaks above ₹960 or not will then determine the next move. A strong break above ₹960 will boost the momentum. Such a break will pave the way for RIL to target the psychological ₹1,000 mark going forward. It will also wipe out the threat of the double-top reversal pattern formation on the chart that we have been reiterating in this column over the last few weeks. But if the stock reverses lower from ₹960 it can fall to ₹940 or ₹935 again. The possibility of the stock extending its downmove towards ₹910 or even ₹900 cannot be ruled out. In such a scenario, RIL can remain in the ₹880-₹960 sideways range for some more time.
After a strong surge for three consecutive weeks, the rally in Tata Steel (₹771) paused last week. The stock was stuck in a narrow range between ₹760 and ₹780 last week. Resistance is around ₹785. As long as the stock remains below this hurdle, an intermediate dip to ₹745 or ₹740 cannot be ruled out. Further fall below ₹740 looks less probable at the moment. A range bound move with a bullish bias between ₹740 and ₹785 can be seen for some time in such a scenario. An eventual break and a decisive weekly close above ₹785 will boost the momentum. Such a break will take the stock higher to the next targets of ₹830 and ₹850. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹930 and ₹950 over the long-term. Investors can hold the long positions. Retain the stop-loss at ₹640 and revise it higher to ₹680 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹800. As mentioned last week, investors can consider booking partial profits around ₹900 levels. A trendline support at ₹710 and the 100-day moving average at ₹694 are the key supports for Tata Steel. The outlook will turn negative only if it declines below ₹694 decisively, which looks unlikely at the moment.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee inaugurating the Bengal Business Global Summit in West Bengal on Tuesday.




West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee inaugurating the Bengal Business Global Summit in West Bengal on Tuesday.


Reliance Industries will invest Rs 5,000 crore in the next three years in ""non-Jio"" businesses in Bengal, its Chairman, Mukesh Ambani said here today.
According to him, the investments will come through areas such as retail petroleum outlets.
This could mean setting up on new petrol pumps or making operarional some of the existing ones that have remained shut for quite sometime now.
""We will invest Rs 5,000 crore in the non-Jio business in West Bengal in the areas of retail petroleum outlets in the state in the next three years"", Ambani said while speaking at the Bengal Business Global Summit - the annual investors meet organised by the West Bengal government.
According to him, Reliance Industries is also planning an electronics manufacturing facility in Bengal. The facility would look at mobile phone making and also manufacturing of set top boxes (STBs) and television sets.
""We plan to have a next gen electronics making facility for mobiles, STBs and TVs,"" Ambani said.
With the diversified conglomerate interested in participating in the ""Bengal growth story""; Ambani promised expansion of Jio services in the state.
Apart from better connectivity in villages, Jio's increased optic fibre network will ensure coverage and connectivity across all educational institutions including schools, colleges and universities.
""We intend to cover all 100 per cent of villages in Bengal through our fibre network by 2019. We will also connect all educational institutions and healthcare facilities in the state,"" Ambani said.
Against a commited investment (in its backend infrastructure) of Rs 4,500 crore; Reliance has already invested Rs 15,000 crore in the last two years. Investments were primarily towards setting up the Jio network.
In that sense, Reliance had emerged as one of the largest investor in the state.
Priority would also be given to push West Bengal as a priority destination for greater penetration of Jio phones for better 4G adiption.
Of a near 9 billion population in Bengal, nearly 1.2 crore are Jio users.
Reliance would also look at setting up 'Jio Digital Service centres' that would look at providing goverment-to-consumer (G2C) services.
These service centres - much on the lines of a common service centre concept, as was once mooted by the Centre - would provide fillip to rural entrepreneurship and can also be leveraged for e-commerce purposes.
These will also support agri and MSMEs in rural areas.
""We will start with five districts in the state on a pilot basis and on an immediate basis. Later, we will scale them to all districts of Bengal,"" he said.
Also on cards was a cloud-based point-of-sale offering and digital billing solutions at a retailer level. ""We are moving towards faster adoption of digital services especially over the Jio network,"" Ambani said.
He also announced a chair in the honour of scientist of SN Bose in a prestigious university."
250,2018-01-19,Reliance,"RJio logs first net profit of ₹504 cr in Dec quarter
Reliance Jio today posted its first-ever net profit of ₹504 crore for the three-month period ended December 2017, the second quarter of commercial operations.
The company had incurred a loss of ₹271 crore in the September quarter.
The revenue from operations stood at ₹6,879 crore, 11.9 per cent growth over the previous quarter.
The earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) — at ₹2,628 crore — was 82.1 per cent more than the sequential quarter. The operating profit margin improved quarter-over-quarter to 38.2 per cent. RJio’s subscriber base as on December 31, 2017 stood at 160.1 million, a company release said."
249,2018-01-24,Reliance,"RIL: Strong show
In the December 2017 quarter, the consolidated profit of Reliance Industries grew 25 per cent y-o-y to ₹9,423 crore. This strong show was led by the petrochemicals segment — healthy volume growth and better margins translated into operating profit growth of 73 per cent y-o-y to ₹5,753 crore.
This offset the marginal fall in operating profit in the refining segment to ₹6,165 crore due to dip in crude volumes refined. Besides these mainstays, the digital business (RJio) established itself as a profit driver, posting its first quarterly net profit (₹504 crore) aided by subscriber additions and cut in interconnectivity usage charges.
The organised retail business also delivered with operating profit more than doubling. Oil and gas exploration though struggled with losses continuing due to production challenges. The results vindicate key expectations — path to profit of RJio and expansion-led gains in core businesses — that have driven the stock’s 80 per cent rally over last year."

   -  Bloomberg


Taiwanese firm MediaTek today said it is working with Reliance Jio for using its chipset that is designed for entry-level Android Go Oreo edition smartphones.
MediaTek General Manager (Wireless Communications BU) TL Lee said the devices are expected to be rolled out in the first quarter of the year.
“In addition to their own 4G feature phone, RJio is working hard with not only MediaTek but also Google for smartphone devices... entry level Android Go,” he told reporters here.
Lee said the company is focussed on bringing more premium features such as support for face unlock, 18:9 display and dual 4G VoLTE on entry and mid-level smartphones in the country.
Besides, MediaTek has designed ‘Sensio’ — a 6-in-1 biosensor module that can allow users to monitor health parameters like blood pressure and oxygen levels through their smartphones.
The company is engaged in dialogue with multiple players globally in the health ecosystem for deploying the module."
247,2018-02-02,Reliance,"RJio tops chart with peak 4G speed of 25.6 Mbps in Nov: TRAI 
Reliance Jio topped the chart of 4G broadband service providers for the 11th straight month by recording a peak download speed of 25.6 Mbps for November 2017, data published by telecom regulator TRAI showed today.
Vodafone, the closest competitor to RJio, registered a top download speed of 10 Mbps followed by Bharti Airtel 9.8 Mbps and Idea Cellular 7 Mbps in November 2017, as per TRAI data. In October, RJio had registered a top speed of 21.8 Mbps.
 








 
 
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India collects and computes data download speed with the help of its ’MySpeed’ application on a real-time basis. In terms of upload speed, Vodafone overtook Idea Cellular in November by registering a speed of 6.9 Mbps. Idea logged a peak upload speed of 6.6 Mbps, followed by RJio which registered a speed of 4.9 Mbps. Airtel recorded an upload speed of 4 Mbps. In October, Idea had topped the chart by registering the highest upload speed of 7.1 Mbps."
246,2018-02-08,Reliance,"Amid sell-off, brokerages bet on Reliance, Maruti, Motherson Sumi 
Even though the Indian economy is forecast to witness a slight improvement in macro-economic fundamentals, namely crude oil prices, inflation and GST revenues (mostly expected in the second half), the equity market is likely to continue to be on a bumpy road in the medium term. This is mainly due to improvement in global economic outlook and rising US bond yields followed by domestic factors such as imposition of long-term capital gains tax and uncertainty over improvement in corporate performance.
Kotak Institutional Equities still finds valuation of the Indian market rich and the quality of earnings growth still poor. “The pressure on equity multiples is likely to continue if the current macro-economic conditions sustain, even without further deterioration. It is imperative that earnings do not disappoint in case India’s macro continues to be subdued or deteriorates further.
“A large portion of the incremental profits of the Nifty 50 Index and KIE Universe Coverage are coming from sectors such as PSU banks, metals & mining, oil & gas and utilities, which should logically trade at lower multiples (10-12X given the low return on equity of the businesses and/or high profitability in the case of commodities),” it said.
Benchmark index Nifty 50 is down 5.3 per cent from its all-time high of 11,171.55 on January 29 and is flat on year-to-date basis.
Every dip should be seen as a buying opportunity by long-term investors, according to experts.








 
 
IDFC Securities has maintained its Nifty target for March 2018 at 11,300. “The current dip seems a healthy correction and makes us re-emphasise buying on such dips,” it said.
While mid- and small-cap stocks are prone to corrections amid any sell-off, risk-averse investors are better off focussing on large-caps stocks for now.








 
Reliance Industries, Maruti Suzuki and Motherson Sumi Systems are the common top picks among large-cap stocks recommended by brokerages such as BNP Paribas, IDFC Securities and Kotak Institutional Equities. These stocks have gained 46-76 per cent in the last one year. ICICI Bank, HPCL, Hindalco and HDFC Bank are some more picks of brokerages. Among the mid-caps, stocks such as Kajaria Ceramics, SpiceJet, Ashoka Buildcon, Greenply Industries, Ashok Leyland, Bharat Electronics and Aurobindo Pharma are the preferred picks. Except Aurobindo (down 14 per cent), the above stocks have risen 4-115 per cent."

Reliance JioPhone will get its own Facebook app from Wednesday, a move that will open up the social networking platform to a potential 50 crore feature phone users in India.
This new version of the Facebook app is built specially for Jio KaiOS, a web-based operating system designed for JioPhone, so that its users get the best experience of Facebook, Reliance Jio Infocomm said in a statement.
“JioPhone is the world’s most affordable smartphone built with transformational technology especially for Indians to migrate from a feature phone to a smartphone. As promised, JioPhone will be home to the world’s leading applications, starting with Facebook. Jio, the world’s largest mobile data network, is built to empower every Indian with the power of data and JioPhone is an integral part of this Jio movement,” Akash Ambani, Director at RJio said.
The Facebook app for JioPhone supports push notifications, video, and links to external content. The app is also optimised to accommodate the cursor function on JioPhone and delivers Facebook’s most popular features such as News Feed and Photos.
“We are excited about our partnership with Jio and the opportunity to provide the best possible Facebook experience for millions of people using JioPhone,” said Francisco Varela, Vice-President of Mobile Partnerships, Facebook. “Working with partners like Jio, we want to make sure everyone, everywhere has the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of being connected.”
in July 2017, Reliance Jio Infocomm, the telecom arm of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries (RIL), unveiled a handset — JioPhone — that is “made in India by young Indians for all Indians”. It came with an effective zero price. However, the company said it will collect a one-time refundable amount of ₹1,500. The handsets were later launched on August 15, 2017."

 Mukesh Ambani today said his firm Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and its global partners will set up the country’s first integrated digital area in Maharashtra entailing investments of Rs 60,000 crore. .
“Reliance along with other global companies will invest over Rs 60,000 crore in the next 10 years in Maharashtra, which will be the first integrated digital industrial area in the country,” Ambani said at the opening day of the Magnetic Maharashtra investor summit here.
He did not offer more details like the location of the proposed mega investment or when the first phase will begin. The summit is being inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Ambani said RIL has received overwhelming response from global technology companies to invest in this project. .
“Within a few weeks, more than 20 global companies have already agreed to invest with us. These companies include Cisco, Siemens, HP, Dell, Nokia and Nvidia among others,” Ambani said.
He said what China could achieve with its manufacturing revolution, India can achieve much more and quickly in this services-led fourth industrial revolution.
The new investments announced come on back of close Rs 1.4 trillion RIL has pumped into building one of the fastest telecom networks in the country with his Reliance Jio network, which has catapulted the country into the world’s no 1 data consumer nation from being 155th before the launch."

Reliance Industries(RIL) appears to be expanding its entertainment footprint rapidly. RIL, through an overseas subsidiary, picked up a 5 per cent stake in Eros International, which is Eros International Media’s parent.
Eros has an extensive collection of over 2,000 films, which would be utilised to add to the content portfolio of RIL. Eros too is expected to benefit from RIL’s media portfolio.








 
Both parties would invest up to ₹1,000 crore to produce and acquire Indian films and digital original content across all languages.

Press Trust of India Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio is aiming to cover 99 per cent of the country’s population by this Diwali, said a top company official.
As part of its expansion plans, RJio has announced the roll-out of Internet of Things (IoT) services in association with Samsung, which will help consumers and enterprises.
“We are deploying around 8,000-10,000 towers every month,” said Reliance Jio Infocomm President Jyotindra Thacker.
He is hopeful that by September or October (Diwali), the company would reach a coverage of 99 per cent.
At present, the company has a subscriber base of 160 million paid customers.
Reliance Jio Tareq Amin Senior V-P Technology Tareq Amin said: “We talked about acquiring 100 million customers in 170 days last year, which was unprecedented. People really doubted our ability to convert from free to paid customers.
“Not only have we converted that, we have largest migration of free to paid services in history. Our network today has 160 million paid subscribers in less than 16 months of operation,” he added.
Through its IoT services, RJio aims to work with the sectors such as transportation, weather forecasting and agriculture.
It is also exploring the possibility of working with third party developers on IoT.
On being asked about as how much time RJio would take to roll out IoT, Amin said the company needs to create an entire ecosystem for that.
“ Rather than of doing city-by-city launch, we would launch IoT always pan India. We are not waiting for network readiness, but we are awaiting maturity of the IoT platform,” he said.
Amin further said RJio’s network would surpass 2G coverage.
“Our coverage in LTE would surpass 2G coverage. We want to connect every person and every village,” Amin added.
“India ranked 154th in the world in mobile internet penetration and today it is number one in the data consumption. We believe that today we have the largest data consumption network in the world and largest video consumption network in the world,” said Amin at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2018.
“Over switching of RJio’s network from 4G to 5G,” he said that “it could be done by software upgrade, only saying that it was a network built for the future.”
“For any network in this world, this migration would be a forklift activity. It’s a nightmare,” he said.
Jio Infocomm, which has already introduced IoT services in Mumbai, now has plans to roll out pan India."

 Five of the 10 most valued Indian companies saw a combined erosion of Rs 26,641.48 crore in market valuation last week, with the country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) taking the steepest hit. The other firms which witnessed a decline in their market capitalisation (m-cap) for the week ended Thursday were TCS, ITC, ONGC and HDFC Bank.

SBI (₹253.1)
 As expected, SBI fell breaking below the 200-week moving average (₹260) support last week. The stock tumbled to a low of ₹244.4, but managed to recover some of the loss before closing 3.6 per cent lower for the week. The crucial support at ₹245 is holding well as of now. Since the stock has been falling continuously over the last few weeks, as long as it sustains above ₹245, a corrective rally in the short term cannot be ruled out. A strong break above the immediate resistance in the ₹258-₹260 zone can trigger this corrective rally, targeting ₹270 in the short term on the back of profit booking. But if SBI fails to breach ₹260 and remains below it, a revisit of ₹245 is possible. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹245 and ₹260 can be seen for some time. The stock will come under renewed pressure if it breaks below ₹245 decisively. Such a break can take it to ₹238 initially. Further break below ₹238 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹205 or ₹200 over the medium term.
 








 
 
ITC (₹259.4)
ITC fell breaking below the key support level of ₹262 last week. Though the stock has bounced from its intra-week low of ₹253.4, the muted price action of this recovery move indicates lack of strength. Strong resistance is in the ₹263-₹266 region. ITC should surpass ₹266 decisively to ease the downside pressure. In such a scenario, the stock can rally to ₹270 and ₹275 again. But the indicators on the chart suggest a lower possibility of the stock breaking above the ₹263-₹266 resistance zone. Immediate support is at ₹257. A strong break below it can drag the stock lower to ₹250 in the coming days. A break below ₹250 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending towards ₹244. Further fall below ₹244 looks less probable at the moment. Short-term traders can go short on rallies at ₹262 and ₹265 with a stop-loss at ₹268 for the target of ₹252. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹259 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹256. Long-term investors, on the other hand can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220.
Infosys (₹1,163.4)
Though, Infosys is stuck in a sideways range for more than two weeks the price action keeps the bias positive. Inability to break above ₹1,169 can keep the stock range-bound between ₹1,130 and ₹1,169 for some time. But a decisive break above ₹1,169 can boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹1,200 initially. It will also increase the possibility of the stock breaching the psychological ₹1,200 mark and targeting ₹1,250 or even higher levels over the medium term. The 21-day moving average at ₹1,138 and a trend line at ₹1,130 are the key supports to watch. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below ₹1,130 decisively. Such a break, though less likely, will increase the possibility of the stock falling towards ₹1,110 and ₹1,100 in the short term. The region between ₹1,100 and ₹1,085 is a strong support for Infosys. A strong fall breaking below ₹1,085 is unlikely as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at lower levels and limit the downside. Both long and medium-term investors can hold the long positions.
RIL (₹912) 
 RIL fell sharply last week after failing to extend its up-move beyond the key resistance at ₹960. The stock tumbled over 6 per cent intra-week and made a low of ₹888.3. However, it managed to bounce from this low recovering some of the loss and closed 3.7 per cent lower for the week. The broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range within which the stock has been trading over the last few months, remains intact. The immediate outlook is unclear. Cluster of moving average (21-, 100- and 55-day moving average) resistances are poised in between ₹922 and ₹928. If RIL manages to break above this resistance cluster, it can rally again towards ₹950 and ₹960 — the upper end of the range. But inability to break above the ₹922-₹928 resistance zone and a pull-back move in the coming days can keep the stock under pressure. In such a scenario, RIL can fall below ₹900 and test ₹880 and ₹870 — the lower end of the range. Traders can continue to stay out of this stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges.
Tata Steel (₹605.6)
Contrary to our expectation, Tata Steel tumbled breaking below ₹630 last week. The stock plummeted 10 per cent in the past week and the stop-loss levels on the long positions have been breached. The uptrend that has been in place since 2016 is under threat now and initial signs of a trend reversal are emanating on the charts. The stock has closed below the 200-day moving average for the first time in two years. Cluster of resistances in between ₹635 and ₹650 can cap the upside. Intermediate bounces may find fresh sellers coming into the market at higher levels in the above-mentioned resistance zone. As long as the stock remains below ₹650, the outlook will remain bearish and a fall to ₹580 cannot be ruled out. A strong break below ₹580 will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹555. Short-term traders can go short on rallies at ₹630 and ₹650. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹685 for the target of ₹560. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹605 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹585."
238,2018-03-15,Reliance,"CAG report raps tax dept for alleged discrepancies in RIL’s books
A faulty tax assessment system is letting large conglomerates get away with paying lower taxes, according to a confidential document written by the Indian Audit and Accounts Department.
Using billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) as a test case, the Director General of Audit (Central) in Mumbai at the Indian Audit and Accounts Department conducted an integrated audit of India’s most valued company. The intent was to “examine the impact of scrutiny assessment and extent of co-ordination/cross-linking amongst different assessment charges of the Income Tax Department and ascertain whether there was exchange of relevant information relating to group companies for accomplishing quality assessment,” according to the document seen by BusinessLine.
“We selected RIL as it is one of the biggest corporate entities in the country and engaged in diversified business activities,” wrote Guljari Lal, Director General of Audit (Central).
The integrated audit found that RIL allegedly used its web of subsidiaries, resorted to merger and demerger of group entities, transactions with related parties to book losses and make financial accounts untraceable to avoid paying thousands of crores of rupees in taxes over several years.
RIL response
When contacted, a spokesperson for RIL said: “We are not privy to the CAG report on the Income Tax Assessments made on RIL and its group companies, and hence, are not in a position to comment on its contents. Please note that RIL pays its taxes in accordance with law and is one of the highest tax payers in private sector in India. 
“RIL’s accounts are audited and there cannot be any difference in the recording of transactions among RIL and its group companies. If the facts stated in your query are correct, there seems to be a misunderstanding due to lack of full details on record with the tax department. The tax reliefs claimed by the group are always as allowed in accordance with law and as intended by the legislature. RIL never deploys any scheme to avoid tax burden.”
The Indian Audit and Accounts Department has asked the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Mumbai, to share its views and confirm the facts of the integrated audit to be included in the FY-19 audit report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.
Scrutiny assessment
The scrutiny assessment looked at accounts of several of these entities for seven assessment years – AY03-04, 04-05 and 2007-08 to 2013-14.
During its scrutiny assessment, the department found that RIL had sold and purchased fixed assets and goods, extended and accepted loans, and made donations between its group entities, but the amounts given and received were allegedly not always the same in the books of several entities. The department faulted itself for viewing each entity as a standalone company and not seeing the conglomerate's actions as a whole, which allowed such wrongful transactions to slip through the cracks.
For example, in AY12-13, a loan extended by RIL to Reliance Industries and Investment Ltd was recorded as ₹2,625 crore in the former's books and as ₹2,113 crore in the latter's books – a discrepancy of ₹512 crore. Similarly, in 2013-14, another ₹7,684 crore loan extended by RIL to Reliance Industries & Investment Ltd was shown in the related party’s books as ₹7,735 crore.
According to assessment records, the net profit of RIL from 2008-09 to 2013-14 remained static despite three-fold increase in total revenue.
Between 2008-09 and 2013-14, though total revenue of RIL had increased by 2.7 times, the revenue paid to government increased by 1.9 times only. 
The government audit observed that RIL was paying to the government hardly 1.7 per cent of its turnover as revenue (2008-09), which has now dipped to as low as 1.2 per cent of its turnover (2013-14).
Loan to IMT
In 2011-12, RIL raised secured/unsecured loans of ₹57,854 crore, mainly though ECBs. During the relevant period, RIL extended interest-free loan of ₹6,615 crore to Reliance Industrial Investment and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL), which in turn gave an interest-free loan to Independent Media Trust (IMT) to make business investment.
However, IMT did not file online return for 2012-13 to 2014-15, stating there was no taxable income.
The government audit shows that IMT was used as investment vehicle in a circuitous way to acquire media house of which RIL is the ultimate beneficiary. Thus, by not filing return under the pretext of nil income, it escaped from scrutiny under CASS (computer-aided scrutiny selection) norms. Hence, it becomes apparent that RIL had diverted interest-bearing funds for non-business purpose to reduce its tax liability by bearing substantial finance cost including exchange loss.
KG-D6 oil field 
In its conclusion, the audit department said that the scrutiny assessment loses sight of important issues which have a bearing on determination of taxable income and that the department should re-think its present strategy of scrutiny assessment which is not yielding any significant additional revenue."
237,2018-03-21,Reliance,"‘Krishna-Godavari basin may see investment of over $14 bn’ 
 
The Krishna-Godavari Basin is likely to see a total investment outlay of over $14 billion by two oil and gas exploration and production companies by 2021-2023, according to a senior Government official.
ONGC’s field development plans estimates production of 15-18 million metric standard cubic metres per day, while another major player (Reliance Industries) may produce about 25-30 mmscmd. Together, these two players plan to produce more than 40-43 million tonnes of oil equivalent from the Krishna-Godavari Basin, which has huge potential, said Atanu Chakraborty, Director-General of Hydrocrabons, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. In addition to these two majors, investments from other players are also in the pipeline.
Speaking on the sidelines of a meeting hosted by the Ministry to share the progress made under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy here today, the DG said, “While it is a fact that gas production has dropped significantly in the Krishna-Godavari basin from a peak of 65 mmscmd, due to various reasons, including high pressure, high carbon dioxide, high temperature and hostile deep water environs ranging from 1,200 to 2,600 metres, we expect to see more investment and output from the basin, which holds immense potential for the country.”
Under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy, of the 55 blocks being offered, with potential area of about 60,000 sq km, five more blocks are now being offered in the KG Basin. These are estimated to hold resources of about 9.555 mmtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent).
According to data provided by the DGH, based on the geoscientific information of blocks under the Hydrocrabon Exploration and Licensing Policy, the KG Basin comprises 28,000 sq km onland and 2,02,000 sq km of offshore area. While barely about 2000 sq. km has been offered, the extent now offered is nearly five times that, covering three onshore and two offshore blocks. 
The KG Basin, considered to be one of the most prolific basins in the country for oil and gas, is being closely watched by contractors and investors as it has huge potential. While in the past, the D1 and D3 Blocks had good output, they were affected by water ingress, following which output fell. “Once we see high levels of production again, this will make a huge contribution to the country's oil pool,” he said."

SBI is vulnerable for further fall (₹234.6)
The ongoing scams and frauds in the banking sector is keeping stocks in this space under pressure. SBI tumbled about 7 per cent breaking below the crucial support level of ₹241. The fall last week indicates that the downtrend is intact and is gaining strength. Key resistances are at ₹241 and ₹250, which can cap the upside in the short term. A fall to ₹226 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement support level is likely in the short-term. A bounce back-move to ₹241 from ₹226 cannot be ruled out. However, the upside is expected to be capped as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels and cap the upside. An eventual break below ₹226 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or 190 over the medium term. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go short at current levels and at ₹240. Keep the stop-loss at ₹248 for the target of ₹205. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹232 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹227. The downside pressure will ease only if SBI breaches ₹250 decisive. But that looks unlikely in the near term.
Short-term view is negative for ITC (₹256.3)
Weakness in the broader markets dragged ITC below the key support level of ₹258 in the final trading session of the week. The ₹258-₹259 resistance region can cap the upside in the near term. As long as the stock trades below ₹259, a fall to ₹251 or ₹250 is likely. Short-term traders can go short at the current levels and at ₹258. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹259.5 for the target of ₹251. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹255 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹253. A bounce-back thereafter from ₹250 can ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹257 or ₹258 again. But if ITC declines below ₹250 decisively, the downmove can then extend to ₹247 or ₹244 over the medium term. But such a fall will be a good buying opportunity for the medium and long-term investors. Cluster of supports are poised between ₹245 and ₹230, which can halt the downtrend. A strong upward reversal thereafter will mark the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend. Long-term investors can hold the long positions and accumulate at ₹247. Retain the stop-loss at ₹220.
Infosys consolidated within its uptrend (₹1,167.4)
The ₹1,140-₹1,130 region continues to provide strong support for Infosys. The stock made a low of ₹1,140 and has reversed higher from there. The ₹1,130-₹1,200 sideways range remains intact. Intermediate resistance is at ₹1,177. A break above it can take Infosys higher to ₹1,200. Inability to break above ₹1,200 can pull the stock lower and continue to keep it in the ₹1,130-₹1,200 range. A strong break above ₹1,200 is needed for Infosys to gain fresh momentum. Such a break can take it higher to ₹1,210. Further break above ₹1,210 will see the stock rallying to ₹1,250 and even higher thereafter. On the other hand, Infosys will come under pressure if it breaks below ₹1,130. Such a break will see an intermediate dip to ₹1,100. Further fall below ₹1,100 is less probable as fresh buyers may emerge at lower levels. Also, the overall bias is bullish for Infosys to breach ₹1,200 and extend its upmove over a medium and long term. So any intermediate fall below ₹1,130 will be a good buying opportunity. Both medium- and long-term investors can hold the long positions.
Immediate outlook is unclear for RIL (₹892.8)
RIL was stuck in a narrow range in the past week. The stock was range-bound between ₹887 and ₹911 and has closed on a slightly negative note. The immediate outlook is unclear. Traders can stay out of the stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges. As long as the stock remains below ₹900, a fall to test the crucial support at ₹870 is likely. A break below ₹870 can drag RIL to ₹860 and ₹850 thereafter. But if the stock manages to sustain above the support at ₹870 and reverses higher, the downside pressure will ease. Such a reversal will indicate that the broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range is intact. The stock has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time since last November. Intermediate resistance is at ₹900 and cluster of resistances are poised between ₹920 and ₹930. A strong break above ₹930 will pave way for a fresh rally to ₹960. RIL will gain fresh bullish momentum only if it breaks above ₹960 decisively. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹1,000 or even higher thereafter.
Downtrend intact for Tata Steel (₹566.6)
As expected, Tata Steel extended its fall for the third consecutive week. The stock was down 5.6 per cent last week. Tata Steel has tumbled 16 per cent over the last three weeks. Immediate support is at ₹550. But the stock is vulnerable to break below this level in the coming days as the downtrend has gathered momentum and any upmove would find fresh selling interest coming into the stock. Such a break can drag it to ₹540 or ₹530. The region between ₹540-₹530 is a strong medium-term support. Since the stock has been falling continuously over the last few weeks, a relief rally from the ₹540-₹530 support zone cannot be ruled out. An upward reversal from this support zone can take the stock higher to ₹585 or even ₹600. But if Tata Steel breaks below ₹530 decisively, it can tumble to ₹500 or even ₹480 over the medium term. Traders can hold the short positions. Revise the stop-loss lower to the level of ₹585. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹575 as soon as the stock dips to ₹555. Book profits at ₹545."

Near-term outlook is unclear for SBI (₹250.1)
Contrary to expectations of a fall, SBI witnessed a sharp bounce in the past week. The near-term outlook is unclear. The price action will be key in deciding the next move. Key resistance is in the ₹257-260 region. If SBI manages to breach ₹260 decisively, the downside pressure will ease. Such a break will trigger a relief rally towards ₹271 — a 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level — initially on the back of short covering. Further break above ₹271 will see the up-move extending towards ₹283 — a trendline as well as the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance level. A rally beyond ₹283 is unlikely as the upside is expected to be capped at this level. SBI will come under pressure again only if it breaks below ₹240 decisively. Such a break will bring the bears back into the stock. It will signal the resumption of the overall downtrend and increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹200 and ₹190 over the medium term. Traders can stay out of the stock and wait for a clear trend and a trade signal to emerge.
ITC can remain range bound (₹255.9)
ITC was volatile in the past week. Though it opened with a wide gap-down, it managed to reverse sharply higher closing the gap and surged to a high of ₹265.75 on the same day. However, ITC failed to sustain and came off from this high again, giving back most of the gains made during the week. It closed on a flat note. A dip to revisit the crucial support at ₹250 is likely in the near term. If the stock manages to bounce again from ₹250, it can move higher and remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. But if ITC declines below ₹250 decisively, a fresh fall to ₹247 or ₹244 is possible. As mentioned last week, a cluster of supports poised between ₹245 and ₹230 can halt the current downtrend. A strong upward reversal thereafter will mark the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend. So, investors holding the long positions can accumulate at ₹247 and retain the stop-loss at ₹220. A strong break above ₹265 will bring fresh bullish momentum and take ITC higher to ₹270 and ₹275 thereafter.
Short-term view is negative for Infosys (₹1,134.4)
Infosys tumbled 2.8 per cent last week. The short-term outlook has turned negative after last week’s strong fall. Immediate resistances are at ₹1,140 and ₹1,145. A break above ₹1,145 can ease the downside pressure and take the stock up to ₹1,160. Further break above ₹1,160 will increase the possibility of the stock revisiting ₹1,200 levels. If Infosys remains below ₹1,145, it can be under pressure. While below ₹1,145, a fall to ₹1,090 or ₹1,085 is likely in the short term. Further fall below ₹1,085 is less probable now. But if Infosys breaks below ₹1,085, it will indicate a double-top formation on the chart. This will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹1,050 or even ₹1,030 over the medium term. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go short at current levels. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,165 for the target of ₹1,085. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹1,120 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹1,110. However, the fall to ₹1,050-₹1,030 will be a good buying opportunity for long-term investors.
RIL hovers above a crucial support (₹882.8)
RIL seems to lack strength to breach the psychological level of ₹900. The stock made a high of ₹910 only to close 1.1 per cent lower for the week. A crucial support is at ₹870, which is likely to be tested. If RIL manages to bounce from there, the downside pressure will ease. It will keep the broader ₹870-960 sideways range intact and increase the possibility of the stock bouncing back to ₹900 and ₹920 initially. Further break above ₹920 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹960 — the upper end of the range in the short term. On the other hand, if RIL breaks below ₹870, it can fall to ₹860 or ₹855. A trend line as well as the 200-day moving average supports are poised between ₹860 and ₹855. A strong break below ₹855 will bring renewed pressure for the stock. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹820 or even ₹800 on the back of profit-booking. This down move below ₹855 could be swift as stop-loss orders are likely to be triggered below this level.
Tata Steel can consolidate sideways (₹570.9)
Tata Steel managed to sustain above the key support level of ₹550 last week. However, the price action on the chart reflects that the stock lacks strong buying interest. It made a high of ₹598.85 and has come off from it. A revisit to ₹550 is likely in the near term. A bounce from ₹550 can take it back to ₹600 again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹550 and ₹600 can be seen for some time. If Tata Steel manages to breach ₹600, the downside pressure can ease and a rally to ₹635 is possible. Further break above ₹635 looks unlikely at the moment as the bias continues to remain bearish. As such, an eventual break below ₹550 can take Tata Steel lower to ₹535. A strong break below ₹535 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or ₹500 over the medium term. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go short. Keep the stop-loss at ₹605 for the target of ₹515. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹555 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹545."
232,2018-04-06,Reliance,"RJio’s entry led to $10-b savings for users
Reliance Jio’s disruptive entry in September 2016 led to $10 billion in annual savings for consumers and will expand India’s per capita GDP by about 5.65 per cent, says a report.
RJio has made data accessible and affordable, with average prices per GB dropping to ₹10 from ₹152, bringing the internet within the reach of a larger proportion of the Indian population.








 
 
Such a drastic reduction in data prices has also allowed newer segments of society to use and experience it for the first time.
RJio is the telecom venture of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries.
“As per our calculations, even the most conservative estimate shows that due to RJio’s entry, the annual financial savings to the consumers would be to the tune of $10 billion,” said the report by Institute for Competitiveness(IFC).
It said econometric analysis shows that through widespread network effects, RJio’s entry would boost India’s GDP by about 5.65 per cent, if everything else in the economy remains constant.
Impact on GDP growth
The effect on GDP growth due to higher internet penetration will not just be a contribution of the telecom sector but also the various externalities that arise out of the internet economy, it said.
IFC analysed RJio’s entry to measure the impact of internet penetration on economic growth. The model used data from 18 States from 2004-14 and showed that a 10 per cent increase in internet penetration led to per capita GDP rising by 3.9 per cent, if all else remains constant.








 
 
IFC is Gurgaon-based Indian unit of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School.
“Since RJio’s entry into the Indian telecom markets on September 2016, the face of the industry has not remained the same. It changed the basis of competition by offering free lifetime calling to its consumers in an industry that derived 75 per cent of its revenue from voice,” the report said.
Within six months of RJio’s launch, India became the highest mobile data user in the world consuming over 1 billion GB data every month as compared to 200 million GB earlier. By 2017-end, its users on an average consume almost 10 GB data, 700 minutes of voice and 134 hours of video every month. “Data usage in the country has soared. India is now only second to China in terms of app downloads. Such levels of digital consumption were unprecedented a year-and-a-half ago,” it said.
Stating that before RJio’s entry there were hardly many avenues where such high levels of data could be expended by a consumer, the report said RJio offers its consumers a wide bouquet of digital applications that address a variety of consumer needs ranging from education, health, entertainment and banking.
“All of these services form a part of the digital platform through which RJio aims to address multiple socio-economic needs of its customers,” it added."

SBI forms a bullish reversal pattern (₹259.8)
After an initial struggle, SBI managed to breach decisively the 21-day moving average (₹250) resistance towards the end of the week. The stock was up 3.8 per cent last week and has closed on a strong note. The level of ₹250 will now be a good support for the stock. The price action on the chart since March indicates the formation of an inverted head and shoulder pattern. This is a bullish reversal pattern. The neckline resistance of this pattern is at ₹262. A strong break above ₹262 will confirm this pattern and take SBI higher to ₹268 initially. Further break above ₹268 will pave way for the next targets of ₹275 and ₹280. On the other hand, if SBI fails to rise past ₹262 in the coming days, it can fall back towards ₹250 levels again. A break below ₹250 can then drag the stock lower to ₹240 levels again. Traders can go long on a break above ₹262. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹252 for the target of ₹280. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹268.
Near-term view is positive for ITC (₹260.6)
ITC remained broadly in a sideways range all through last week. The near-term view is positive. A rise to test the ₹264-₹266 resistance region is possible in the coming days. Whether ITC breaks above ₹266 or not will be key in deciding the next move. A strong break above ₹266 will bring renewed strength to the stock. Such a break can then trigger a fresh rally to ₹274. The rally to ₹274 will also mark the end of the downtrend that has been in place since February. On the other hand, if ITC fails to breach ₹266 and reverses lower in the coming days, it can fall to ₹260 or ₹257 again. The region between ₹257 and ₹255 is a key near-term support. A bounce from this support zone can take the stock ITC higher again and keep it range-bound between ₹255 and ₹266 for some time. But if ITC declines below ₹255, it can fall to test the crucial support level of ₹250. A break below it can drag it to ₹250. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at the level of ₹220.
Short-term outlook is negative for Infosys (₹1,129.3)
Infosys remained subdued and range-bound between ₹1,120 and ₹1,150. Key resistances are at ₹1,147 and ₹1,155. As long as the stock remains below these resistances, a fall to ₹1,090 cannot be ruled out. A bounce from ₹1,090 will ease the pressure and take Infosys higher to ₹1,150 levels again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range bound between ₹1,090 and ₹1,200 for sometime. But if Infosys breaks below ₹1,090, a fall to ₹1,050 or even ₹1,030 is possible over the medium-term. But further fall below the ₹1,050-₹1,030 support zone is unlikely as fresh buyers can emerge in the market. As mentioned last week, a fall to ₹1,050-₹1,030, if seen, will be a good buying opportunity for long-term investors. Traders who have taken short positions last week can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,165 for a revised target of ₹1,105. Move the stop-loss lower to ₹1,125 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹1,115. Medium and long-term investors can hold the long positions.
Near-term view is positive for RIL (₹909.7)
RIL snapped its four-week fall. The stock surged 2.8 per cent last week. Key resistances are at ₹921 and ₹928, which are likely to be tested in the near term. Inability to breach these hurdles can pull the stock lower to ₹900 or ₹890 levels again. But if RIL manages to breach ₹928 decisively, it can gain momentum. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹960 over the short term. A strong break above ₹928 will boost the momentum. Such a break can take RIL higher to ₹960 in the short term. The level of ₹960 is a crucial resistance for RIL. A strong break above it will pave way for the next targets of ₹1,000 and ₹1,020 over the medium. But if RIL reverses lower from ₹960, it can fall back to ₹920 or ₹900 levels again. In such a scenario, the broader ₹870-₹960 range will remain intact. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go long at current levels. Keep the stop-loss at ₹885 for the target of ₹955. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹920 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹935.
Resistance to cap the upside in Tata Steel (₹586.3)
Tata Steel remained lower but in a narrow range in the past week. The stock has been consolidating over the last couple of weeks within its overall downtrend. The level of ₹600 is a key near-term resistance. A strong break above it is needed for the downside pressure to ease. Such a break can trigger a corrective rally towards ₹630. But the upside is expected to be capped as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels. As such, a further rally beyond ₹630 looks less probable now as the bias continues to remain bearish on the stock. A revisit of ₹550 is likely in the coming days. A break below ₹550 can take the stock lower to ₹535 initially. Further break below ₹535 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or even ₹500 over the medium term. Traders who have taken short positions can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹605 for the target of ₹515. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹555 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹545.

Reliance Industries along with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction has acquired the debt-laden textile company Alok Industries in a National Company Law Tribunal-driven debt resolution process.
Resolution process
RIL in a statement on Thursday said it is awaiting the outcome of the resolution process.
“Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis and in this process has submitted a bid jointly with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd for resolution of Alok Industries in terms of the IBC code,” it said.
“We are awaiting for the outcome of the bid and accordingly there is no disclosure required by us at this stage,” RIL said in a BSE filing.
Insolvency proceedings
In July 2017, the Ahmedabad Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal had admitted insolvency proceedings against the textile company under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
 The consortium of lenders, led by SBI, is claiming dues of over ₹23,000 crore from Alok Industries.
Vote in favour
The consortium has bid around ₹4,500-5,000 crore, which is marginally higher than the liquidation of ₹4,200 crore fixed by lenders and there is no equity allocation to the creditor, said sources.
Most of the lenders to Alok Industries have voted in favour of the resolution plan given by Reliance, he added.

Resistance caps the upside in SBI (₹251.2)
SBI failed to breach the key resistance level of ₹262 last week. The stock reversed sharply lower after making a high of ₹265.25 and closed 3.3 per cent down for the week. Immediate support is at ₹248. If SBI manages to sustain above this support, a bounce-back move to ₹262 is possible again. 
 








 
 
A strong break above ₹262 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹270 initially. Further break above ₹270 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹283 or ₹285. On the other hand, if SBI declines below the immediate support at ₹248 in the coming days, it can come under more pressure. Such a break can drag it to the crucial support level of ₹240. Whether SBI breaks below ₹240 or not will decide the next move. A bounce from ₹240 can keep it range-bound between ₹240 and ₹260 for some time. But a strong break and a decisive close below ₹240 can bring renewed pressure on the stock. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or ₹190 over the medium term.
ITC may remain range-bound (₹260.8)
ITC rallied as expected to test the resistance at ₹266. But it failed to sustain higher and came-off sharply from ₹268.2 and closed the week on a flat note. Inability to bounce from the current levels can keep the stock under pressure. Support is at ₹258. A break below it can drag the stock lower to ₹255 or even ₹250 in the short term. The region between ₹251 and ₹250 is a crucial support that has been limiting the downside since November. An upward reversal from this support region can take ITC higher to ₹260 and ₹265 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below ₹250 decisively. Such a break can take the stock lower to ₹245 or ₹244 initially. Further break below ₹244 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹235 or even lower. On the other hand, if ITC bounces from the immediate support at ₹258, it can move up to ₹265 or ₹267. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220
Infosys maintains its uptrend (₹1,169)
Infosys snapped its three-week fall as the psychological support at ₹1,100 held well. The stock made a low of ₹1,105 and surged to close the week 3.3 per cent higher. This upward reversal keeps the ₹1,100-₹1,200 sideways range intact. Infosys has been stuck in this range since February. As long as the stock remains above the ₹1,150-₹1,140 support zone, the possibility is high of it extending its upmove towards ₹1,200. Inability to break above ₹1,200 can drag Infosys lower to ₹1,150 or even lower. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound for some time. But if Infosys manages to breach ₹1,200 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹1,250 or ₹1,270. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 or even higher levels over the long term. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below the ₹1,100-₹1,090 support
Key resistance ahead for RIL (₹938.85)
RIL extended its rally for the second consecutive week. The stock surged 3.2 per cent in the past week. The near-term view remains positive. Support is in the ₹925-₹920 region. The stock can extend its current upmove and test the crucial resistance level of ₹960 in the coming days. Inability to break above ₹960 and a subsequent pull-back move will take the stock lower to ₹920. In such a scenario, the broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range will remain intact. RIL has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time. On the other hand, the stock will gain fresh momentum if it manages to breach ₹960 decisively. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹1,000 and ₹1,020 in the coming weeks. The outlook will turn negative only if the stock breaks below ₹870. But such a break look less probable at the moment. Traders who have taken long positions last week can hold it with a revised stop-loss at ₹920 and target of ₹955. Move the stop-loss further higher to ₹938 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹945.
Tata Steel lacks strength (₹593.3)
Tata Steel inched higher for the third consecutive week. The stock was up 1.5 per cent. Immediate support is at ₹588 — the 21-day moving average that is likely to be tested in the initial part of the week. An upward reversal from there will see the current rally extending towards ₹620 or even ₹630 in the coming weeks. Further break above ₹630 looks less likely now as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels. A pull-back fromthe level of ₹630 can drag the stock to ₹600 or even lower levels thereafter. On the other hand, if Tata Steel declines below the 21-day moving average (₹588) support, it can fall to ₹570 or ₹560. Further break below ₹560 will then increase the likelihood of the stock falling towards ₹550 or ₹545. The region between ₹550 and ₹545 is a key medium-term support. A break below ₹545 can take the stock lower to ₹535 initially. Further break below ₹535 will then increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or ₹500 over the medium term."

The ‘Satellite cluster’ is the second of three projects in the KG-D6 block integrated development.




The ‘Satellite cluster’ is the second of three projects in the KG-D6 block integrated development.


 BP and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) today announced the sanctioning of the ‘Satellite cluster’ project in KG-D6 block, which will entail an investment outlay of over Rs 40,000 crore (about $ 6 billion).
The companies are moving forward to develop the block’s discovered deep-water gas fields in an integrated series of projects, bringing new gas production for India.
The ‘Satellite cluster’ is the second of three projects in the KG-D6 block integrated development. The first of the projects, development of the ‘R-Series’ deep-water gas fields, was sanctioned in June 2017. Together the three projects will develop about 3 trillion cubic feet of discovered gas resources.
They expect to bring 30-35 million cubic meters (1 billion cubic feet) a day new domestic gas production onstream, phased over 2020-2022.
Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of RIL, said: “This development supports the country’s imminent need for increasing domestic gas supply and is a firm step towards making India a gas-based economy.”
Bob Dudley, BP Group Chief Executive, welcomed the investment decision: “This latest investment is a further demonstration of BP’s commitment to India. Through our partnership, Reliance and BP are able to develop these discovered gas resources efficiently and economically, working closely with the Government of India. These new developments will produce much needed energy for India’s thriving economy.”
The Satellites cluster is a dry gas development and comprises four discoveries with five well subsea development in 1,700 metres water depth, up to 15 kilometres east and southeast of the producing D1D3 fields in KG-D6.
The first of the KG-D6 projects to be sanctioned, the R-series project, is already in execution phase with all major contracts awarded. The Satellites cluster project will draw on execution synergies with the R-series project being developed concurrently.
India today consumes over 5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas and aspires to double gas consumption by 2022. Gas production from the integrated development is expected to help reduce India’s import dependence and amount to over 10 per cent of the country’s projected gas demand in 2022, benefiting India and domestic consumers at large.
BP in partnership with RIL in 2011, took a 30 per cent stake in multiple oil and gas blocks in India operated by RIL, including the producing Block KG-D6. Since this partnership in 2011, the two companies have invested about Rs 13,000 crore ($2 billion) in deep-water exploration and production to date.
In addition to the D55 gas discovery announced in 2013, the partnership has combined BP’s technology and skills with RIL’s execution and operational capability to sustain production from the geologically complex reservoirs in D1D3 and D26 fields on Block KG D6."

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and BP plc said Thursday they are moving ahead with the integrated development of the discovered deep-water gas fields in Block KG D6 off India’s eastern coast by sanctioning the ‘satellite cluster’ project.
The announcement comes a few days after the Centre hiked the price of gas produced locally from deep water, ultra-deep water, high temperature and high-pressure fields by 7.6 per cent to $6.78 per million metric British thermal unit (mmbtu) for the first half of FY19 from $6.30 per mmbtu, spurring the gas producer to start development.
The ‘satellite cluster’ is a dry gas development and comprises four discoveries with five well sub-sea development in 1,700 metres water depth, up to 15 km east and south-east of the producing D1D3 fields in KG D6.
The ‘satellite cluster’ is the second of three projects in the Block KG D6 integrated development. The first of the projects — development of the ‘R-Series’ deep-water gas fields — was sanctioned in June 2017. Together, the three projects will develop about 3 trillion cubic feet of discovered gas resources with a total investment of ₹40,000 crore ($6 billion). They are expected to bring a total 30-35 million cubic metres (1 billion cubic feet) of gas a day new domestic gas production on stream, phased over 2020-2022.

India consumes over 5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas and aspires to double consumption by 2022.
“This development supports the country’s imminent need of increasing domestic gas supply and is a firm step towards making India a gas-based economy,” said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, RIL, which holds a 60 per cent participating interest in the block KG D6.
These new developments will produce much needed energy for India’s thriving economy, said Bob Dudley, Chief Executive, BP Group, which has a 30 per cent interest the block.

225,2018-04-19,Reliance,"I-T Dept widens probe into ₹6,500-cr FDI by Biometrix in RIL group entities
  India’s Foreign Tax and Tax Research (FTTR) division has sought information from various countries, including Singapore, on the ₹6,500-crore investment by Singapore’s Biometrix Marketing in companies belonging to Reliance Industries (RIL) or its promoter group. 
Sources told BusinessLine that following the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) recent rap on the knuckles of the Income Tax (I-T) Department for not assessing RIL’s past tax liability correctly, all pending cases, including the Biometrix FDI, are being re-looked.
The FTTR handles classified tax information between India, tax havens and other countries. It can seek information from foreign jurisdictions. 
The investment by Biometrix into Reliance Ports and Terminals, Reliance Utilities, Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure and Relogistics Infrastructure by acquiring compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS), which was among the largest FDI from Singapore, has been under the I-T scanner since 2011. Investigators suspected round-tripping of funds, sources said.
Loan from ICICI Bank
Biometrix allegedly took a loan from ICICI Bank Singapore and lent to four RIL group companies during Financial Year 2007-08. The four-year loan was repaid with interest out of remittances from RIL group companies “other than those it had lent to”. CCPS of four RIL group companies held by Biometrix were purchased by other RIL or promoter group companies to bail Biometrix out of its loan obligation. 
“The Biometrix FDI trail went cold for four years after a few officials were transferred. With the CAG questioning the I-T Department’s approach towards RIL, the matter will be taken to its conclusion,” said an official source.
The I-T investigation report, reviewed by BusinessLine, alleged that the source of the interest payment on the loan by Biometrix was not clear. Also, clarity was required on the source of funds of entities that bought CCPS from Biometrix, the use of the ₹6,500 crore by RIL or group companies and the tax implications. Companies that bailed out Biometrix may have taken a hit on the currency fluctuation as the loan was in dollar terms but the remittances were in rupees.
Biometrix was allegedly a shell company. Reliance Genemedix plc UK bought 9 per cent stake in Biometrix by investing $9,900 in 2007. The due diligence report on Biometrix submitted by ICICI Bank shows one Thakur Sharma, then President of RIL in the US, as Biometrix director, the I-T report says. Reliance Genemedix and Strasbourg Holdings, owned by Atul Shanti Kumar Dayal and Sandeep Tandon, promoted Biometrix, which was liquidated after the loan repayment. Tandon was another RIL group official.
‘Investments by Biometrix into Indian entities have been fully in accordance with the law and scrutinised by the I-T Department years ago. I-T has been provided with all information and been apprised of the facts. This is a regurgitation of an old matter,” an RIL spokesperson said in response to an email."

He was replying to question on how many new recruitments would be made by the company during this financial year.
On attrition rate in the company, he said it was about 32 per cent in the sales and technical areas related to constructions sites.
“If it is taken at the headquarter level, it is just 2 per cent. Average if you go it will come down to 18 per cent,” he explained.
Jog said the company was having partnership with about 6,000 colleges, including technical institutions, across the country.
According to him, there are some embedded courses offered in these institutions and students who clear these are “Reliance ready”.
He said hiring would also be done through referrals and now with the help of social media platforms.
Recruitments through referrals now accounted for about 60-70 per cent of the hirings, he said, adding that college and employees” referrals “are the two major contributors for our hiring plans.”"
223,2018-04-26,Reliance,"Reliance Ind moves Tribunal against SEBI penalty proceedings 
Reliance Industries (RIL) on Thursday approached the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) challenging SEBI’s move to initiate penalty proceedings against the company with regard to alleged unlawful gains in the trading of Reliance Petroleum (RPL) futures in 2007. 
SEBI is expected to impose a penalty worth several hundred crores, sources told BusinessLine. 
Harish Salve, senior Supreme Court lawyer, appeared for RIL in SAT. Another senior Mumbai-based lawyer Janak Dwarkadas too, appeared for RIL. Salve argued that SEBI cannot initiate penal proceedings against RIL, when the company had challenged the original order of the regulator passed in March 2017. 
SEBI last year asked RIL to disgorge ₹447.27 crore, made “unlawfully” by dealing in shares of its erstwhile subsidiary RPL in 2007. But the regulator has initiated penal proceedings only now. 
SAT, however, has said that as of now it may not entertain the miscellaneous plea of RIL but would hear out in June, the company’s appeal against the regulator’s order of March 2017. Apart from disgorgement, SEBI had barred RIL from futures and options (F&O) segment for one year and asked the company to pay pay an interest of 12 per cent per annum since November 2007 on the disgorgement amount. 
SEBI investigation report in 2010 had accused RIL of fraudulent trading in stock market."

Shares of Reliance Industries rose 2 per cent, adding Rs 12,335 crore to its market valuation, ahead of its quarterly results to be announced later in the day.
Earlier in the day, the stock climbed as much as 3.6 per cent to Rs 1,011, a record high on the NSE. On the BSE, the stock hit a 52-week high of Rs 1,010.70.
At the closing trade, the stock was up 2.17 per cent at Rs 996.50 on the NSE. On the BSE, the stock was up 1.99 per cent at Rs 994.75.
The company, led by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, is set to report its March-quarter results later in the day. The energy-to-telecoms conglomerate is expected to report record quarterly consolidated profit of about Rs 9,500 crore ($1.42 billion), according to Thomson Reuters estimates.
Reliance's market cap, which had breached $100 billion in 2007, hovers around $95 billion. More than 4.9 million shares have changed hands, compared with their 30-day moving avg of 6.47 million shares. The stock has risen nearly 6 per cent this year up to Thursday's close.
In the December 2017 quarter, the consolidated profit of Reliance Industries grew 25 per cent y-o-y to ₹9,423 crore. This strong show was led by the petrochemicals segment — healthy volume growth and better margins translated into operating profit growth of 73 per cent y-o-y to ₹5,753 crore.
The company Chairman, Mukesh Ambani, had in December last year outlined five focus areas to put Reliance Industries among the top 20 companies in the world.
Ambani said that as the world transitions from fossil fuels to clean, green and renewable energy, Reliance can become a leading provider of clean and affordable energy to India.

220,2018-04-27,Reliance,"RIL: A strong show, thanks to petchem, retail, telecom


BL21JAM-SHORT.1




BL21JAM-SHORT.1


The March 2018 quarter results of RIL is an encore of sorts of the December 2017 quarter. A strong show by the petrochemical business buttressed by the retail and telecom segments more than offset the weakness in the refining and oil & gas exploration segments.
Overall, the company’s consolidated revenue during Q4 grew 39 per cent YoY to ₹129,120 crore while net profit increased about 17 per cent to ₹9,435 crore.
The petrochemicals segment was again the key profit driver, with operating profit nearly doubling to ₹6,435 crore. This was thanks to strong volume growth aided by the huge capacity expansion (refinery off-gas cracker and other units) during the year, and also higher margins in a part of the product range.
But refining, the other major profit contributor, remained on the back foot. A dip in volumes of crude oil refined combined with a fall in the gross refining margins (to $11 a barrel from $11.5 a barrel) resulted in the segment’s operating profit falling about 11 per cent to ₹5,607 crore.
 








 
 
For the second quarter in a row, the digital business (RJio) retained its position as RIL’s third largest segment in terms of operating profit (₹1,495 crore). This business, in which billions of dollars have been poured in and is being closely watched by the market, continued to do well, with net profit of ₹510 crore, a tad higher than the ₹504 crore reported in the December 2017 quarter. This was thanks to strong additions to the subscriber base (to 186.6 million as of March 2018), healthy data usage by customers (about 40 per cent higher than Bharti Airtel) and healthy ARPU (about ₹20 higher than Bharti Airtel).
The organised retail business continued to grow very strongly with operating profit in the March quarter nearly quadrupling YoY to ₹951 crore. This was driven by store additions and a robust show across various retail businesses.
Oil & gas languishing
The oil and gas exploration business — a core segment a few years back but now a shadow — continued to languish due to declining volumes, locally and internationally. This resulted in the segment’s operating loss rising to ₹600 crore from ₹486 crore in the year-ago period. The contribution of the media business to operating profit (₹4 crore) remains insignificant but the segment could supplement the telecom business along with various other acquisitions undertaken by the company.
Going forward, the core petrochemical and refining segments should continue to drive profits, with cyclical ups and downs. But the sharp growth seen in FY18 could taper with expansions mostly complete. The telecom and retail business should continue to grow strongly. Recent reports raise questions about some accounting practices adopted by the company in the telecom business; developments on this front will need watching over the coming quarters.
Despite the massive capacity expansions undertaken over the past few years in existing and new businesses, RIL’s financial position remains strong. Consolidated debt-to-equity is less than 1 time and the company has cash and equivalents of ₹78,063 crore as of March 2018."

217,2018-04-30,Reliance,"Reliance Ind plans to shut oil, gas fields in KG-D6 block
Reliance Industries plans to shut oil and gas production at its main fields in KG-D6 block in the coming months and begin complying with the government’s guidelines for decommissioning facilities in the Bay of Bengal block where output has hit its lowest ever.
“Adhering to the Site Restoration Guidelines issued by Government of India, RIL submitted bank guarantee for decommissioning activity for existing producing fields (D1D3 and MA),” the company said in an investor presentation post announcing its fourth quarter earnings.
RIL had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna-Godavari basin. Of these, MA — the only oil discovery in the block — began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009.
While the company did not provide any timelines for decommissioning and stopping of production at the fields that have witnessed output drop to a fourth of peak, sources privy to the development said MA field may be shut as early as October after the current lease of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, which processes output from the field, expires.
E-mails sent to RIL and its partner BP plc of UK, which holds 30 per cent stake, for comments remained unanswered.
The government’s Site Restoration Guidelines provide for a one-year notice for decommissioning of facilities.
In the presentation, RIL said “average production of gas (from KG-D6 block in January-March 2018) was 4.3 million standard cubic metres per day and oil and condensate was at 1,865 barrels per day.”
The gas output, which was lower than 4.9 mmscmd in the October-December quarter of 2017, was made up of output from D1 and D3 and MA fields. It said this was due to “continuing natural decline” at the fields.
RIL had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of $8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest $2.234 billion, which was scaled down to $1.96 billion in 2012.
The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in less than a decade."

Shares of the company opened on a weak note at Rs 984.70, then lost further ground and fell to an intra-day low of Rs 961.00. At the end of today’s trading session the stock was quoted at Rs 963.10, down 3.18 per cent over its previous closing price.
Following the decline in the stock the market capitalisation of the company eroded by Rs 20,004.96 crore to Rs 6,10,134.46 crore.
On the NSE, the stock opened at Rs 982, then fell to an intra-day low of Rs 960 and finally settled for the day at Rs 963.50, down 3.29 per cent.
On April 27, Reliance Industries reported its highest quarterly net profit of Rs 9,435 crore. While its core petrochemical business posted record quarterly pre-tax profits, earnings from the oil refining business dipped on squeeze in margins. The stock of Reliance Industries was the second largest loser in the 30-share index.
Moody's outlook
Meanwhile, global credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service today said robust earnings posted by Reliance Industries in the fiscal year ending March 31 will improve its credit metric, but high cash outflow on capital spending will constrain rating.
Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJIL) “continues to generate negative free cash flow, in line with our expectations,” it said in an issuer comment on RIL. Though Reliance Jio reported second straight quarterly profit on Friday, the average revenue per user (ARPU) fell about 11 per cent q/q.
Even though the company’s reported net debt increased to Rs 1,40,700 crore as of March 31, 2018, compared to Rs 1,19,400 crore a year ago, its credit metrics as measured by net debt/EBITDA declined to 1.9x for fiscal 2018 compared to 2.1x for fiscal 2017, it said adding the improvement in credit metrics is driven by higher earnings from its energy segment.
The company also plans to shut oil and gas production at its main fields in KG-D6 block in the coming months and begin complying with the government’s guidelines for decommissioning facilities in the Bay of Bengal block where output has hit its lowest ever. 
Brokerages view
Jefferies analysts said petrochemical volumes may rise from Q4 levels... LNG-petcoke spreads have seasonally softened and oil and gas volumes are falling too, but valuations are rich.
Jefferies has rated the stock “underperform” with a price target of Rs 790. Motilal Oswal analysts wrote that renewed focus on competition in the form of downward revisions in price plans led to an 11 per cent q/q fall in ARPU to Rs 137. Although recent ARPU cuts have been disappointing, competitive intensity may abate over the next 2-3 quarters, the brokerage added.
Of 38 brokerages that cover the stock, 28 rate “buy” or higher, four “hold” and the rest “sell” or lower; their median price target is Rs 1,051.50. Up to Friday’s close, the stock has risen over 8 per cent this year."

214,2018-05-07,Reliance,"Reliance’s East West Pipeline seeks tripling of transmission charges
East West Pipeline Ltd (EWPL), earlier known as Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd, has sought a tripling of natural gas transmission charges across its network from this fiscal.
Justifying the higher price, it said that since gas supplies from the current sources are quite unsure from a long-term perspective, EWPL will have to source gas from other sources. The $10 a mBtu (million British thermal unit) price has been considered benchmarked with expected R-LNG price (crude oil priced at $55 per barrel with a 14 per cent linkage).
EWPL operates the 1,460 km East West Natural Gas Pipeline (EWNGP) that transports KG gas from Kakinada to Bharuch, passing through Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat.
EWPL wants the gas transmission charge incresaed from ₹52.23 a mBtu charged till 2017 to ₹151.84 a mBtu for 2018-2019 to 2035-36.
Justifying the hike, EWPL has estimated future operating expenses (OPEX) at ₹36,862.50 crore for 2018-2019 to 2035-36. “There is a substantial jump in projected OPEX considered from financial year 2017-18 onwards,” said a consultation paper of downstream oil regulator PNGRB.
The OPEX includes a system use gas (SUG) expense of ₹21,863.73 crore. SUG is the quantity of gas used by the transporter for the operation and maintenance of the pipeline system.
EWPL said that it has considered SUG volume at 1.2 million standard cubic meters per day from 2017-18 till 2033-34. It has assumed the price of gas at $10.10 per mBtu."

SBI (₹250.9)
SBI rose 3.7 per cent last week. This rally has eased the downside pressure and turned the near-term view positive. So, traders can exit and book loss on the short positions taken a couple of weeks back. An immediate resistance is in the ₹253-₹254 region, which is likely to be tested in the early part of the week. A break above ₹254 can take the stock higher to ₹259 and ₹260. Further break above ₹260 can extend the up-move to ₹264 and ₹265. The level of ₹265 is a crucial short-term resistance. Inability to breach this hurdle can pull the stock lower to ₹255 and ₹250. In such a scenario, SBI can remain range-bound between ₹230 and ₹265 for some time. If SBI breaks above ₹265 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹270 or even ₹280 levels in the coming weeks. It will also signal that the downtrend that has been in place since November last year has come to an end.










 ITC (₹283.9) 
 ITC reversed higher last week and was up 2.3 per cent. The 55-week moving average at ₹277 has been providing strong support for the stock over the last two weeks, keeping the overall bullish outlook intact. However, a crucial resistance cluster is ahead in the ₹285-₹290 region. ITC has to breach above ₹290 decisively to keep the current uptrend intact. Price action on the charts suggests that the possibility is high of the stock breaching ₹290 and targeting ₹295 initially. Further break above ₹295 will take the stock up to ₹305. On the other hand, if ITC reverses lower from ₹290 , it can fall to ₹280 or ₹275 — a key short-term support. An immediate break below ₹275 looks less probable at the moment. If the stock manages to sustain above ₹275, a range-bound move between ₹275 and ₹290 can be seen in the short term. If ITC breaks below ₹275, a fall to ₹270 or ₹268 is possible. Long-term investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220.










 Infosys (₹1,181) 
 Infosys remained subdued and closed on a mixed note last week. The 21-day moving average at ₹1,167 had provided strong support for the stock. As long as Infosys remains above this support, It can break above the crucial ₹1,200-₹1,205 resistance region. Such a break will mark the end of the prolonged sideways consolidation phase. The stock has been stuck in the band between ₹1,100 and ₹1,200 since January. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,205 will take the stock higher to revisit the previous highs of ₹1,278. Such a rally will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 and ₹1,375 levels over the medium term. The near-term view will turn negative if the stock declines below the 21-day moving average. In such a scenario, a fall to ₹1,140 or ₹1,135 levels is possible. Further break below ₹1,135 will see the down-move extending to ₹1,100 . Both medium- and long-term investors can hold their long positions.










RIL (₹988.5)
RIL managed to reverse higher in the past week and has recovered most of the loss made in the week earlier. The stock surged 3.6 per cent last week. Though the weekly chart gives a mixed picture, the daily candles leave the near-term outlook positive. A test of the psychological resistance level of ₹1,000 is possible. A strong break above ₹1,000 will take the stock higher to ₹1,030 . Whether RIL breaks above ₹1,030 or not will decide the next move. Inability to break above ₹1,030 can pull the stock lower to ₹1,000. A break below ₹1,000, will see the down-move extending towards ₹980 or ₹970. On the other hand, if RIL manages to break above ₹1,030 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum and rally towards ₹1,085. The 21-day moving average at ₹959 is a key support. The outlook will turn negative only if RIL declines below this support. A strong break below ₹959 will then increase the possibility of the stock falling to ₹930 or even ₹900 .










 Tata Steel (₹606)
Tata Steel has risen, breaking above the key psychological resistance level of ₹600 last week. This has eased the downside pressure and is also slightly turning the bias positive. The key resistance is in the ₹615-620 region is likely to be tested in the coming days. Traders who have taken short position last week on rallies at ₹590 and ₹596 can exit and book loss at current level. Whether Tata Steel breaks above ₹620 or not will be key in deciding the next move. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹620 ease the downside pressure. Such a break will take the stock higher to ₹635 or even to ₹650. This move above ₹620 could be swift on the back of short covering. On the other hand, if Tata Steel reverses lower from ₹620, it can fall to ₹600 initially. If it manages to bounce from this psychological support, a range-bound move between ₹600 and ₹620 can be seen for some time. But a break below ₹600 can drag the stock lower to ₹585."
212,2018-05-16,Reliance,"Fitch affirms RIL ratings with stable outlook 
 Global rating agency Fitch today affirmed Reliance Industries’ long-term foreign currency rating at BBB-, with a stable outlook. RIL’s rating is supported by its strong business profile, which is driven by its robust refining and petrochemical operations, the agency said in a note.
Its primary analyst and a director, Muralidharan R, cited the robust and improved refining operations that consistently outperform regional refining benchmarks as one of the reasons for retaining the rating with stable outlook.
The company runs the world’s largest single-location refinery at Jamnagar, with a daily capacity of around 1.24 million barrels. Reliance Industries (RIL) also benefits from its dominant market position in the petrochemical business, driven by its integrated business model with minimal presence in upstream. RIL recently completed a massive capex that upped the downstream integration, improving its business profile.
RIL’s GRM (gross refining margin) improved to $11.6 a barrel in FY18, from $11 a barrel in FY17, in line with strong industry-wide margins, Muralidharan said in the note. “While we expect industry-wide refining margins to moderate, we expect RIL’s GRMs to remain strong, supported by benefits of its capex. It completed the first phase of a gasification project in H2 of FY18, with the balance scheduled for completion in the H1 of FY19,” he said.
But the rating agency noted that its digital services business, Jio, is still small and evolving, and faces intense competition from incumbents. RIL has pumped in around Rs 2.2 trillion till March 2018 into Jio, and “we expect it to make further investments based on the actual growth and performance,” it added.
Since Jio turned profitable in the first year of operations to the year to March 2018, “we expect it to continue to register strong growth and its business to evolve over the medium-term.
“We expect RIL’s financial profile to improve, supported by its strong operating cash flows from its expanded petrochemical and refining business. Cash flows will also benefit from lower capex in its energy businesses over the medium-term,” the agency said.
Its operating and expected financial profile places its unconstrained credit profile at the BBB level, which is reflected in its rupee loan rating, but its foreign currency rating at BBB- is constrained by the sovereign rating.
Other reasons for the rating stance is the expanded petrochemical operations with expanded capacities, commissioning of a refinery off-gas cracker and stronger ethane sourcing, which strengthened its downstream integration and its dominant position in the petrochemical business.
RIL’s petrochemical operating profit rose to Rs 2,120 billion in FY18, from Rs 1,300 crore in FY17, reflecting the benefits of its expanded capacity, feedstock flexibility and improved integration, the agency said.
Fitch expects the telecom business to continue to show robust growth over the medium term. “We expect the subscriber addition to remain strong, driven by attractive high-speed 4G data and feature phone offerings,” it said.
Jio’s subscriber base reached 186.6 million by March 2018 after its first year of commercial operations, with a net addition of 26.5 million in the last quarter boosting revenue.
“While the Jio feature phones may result in lower average realisations in the near-term, we believe it also has the potential to support strong data consumption growth over the medium-term,” said the report.
Declining capex is another reason for the better financial profile, the report said, adding, “We expect RIL’s capex to come down from FY20 following completion of most of its refining and petrochemical expansion in FY18. But we also expect RIL to continue to invest in its mobile business and expand its fibre business, which will drive capex over the medium-term.” 
The agency expects RIL’s free cash flows to turn positive by FY20, driven by strong internal cash flows from its expanded refining and petrochemical operations, which will be primarily driven by declining capex. 
“Consequently, we expect RIL’s net debt to fall and its credit metrics to improve over the medium term, helping its net leverage to fall to below 2.5 times by FY20 and further to around 2 times by FY21,” it said."

 SBI (₹239.2)
SBI began the week on a positive note, but it was short-lived. The stock touched a high of ₹257.2 and came off sharply from there to close 4.7 per cent lower for the week. The near-term view is bearish. A fall to test the crucial support level of ₹231 is likely. If SBI manages to bounce from ₹231, the downside pressure would ease. A relief rally to ₹250 or ₹255 is possible then. Also, a range-bound move between ₹231 and ₹255 is possible for some time in such a scenario. But if SBI breaks below ₹231 decisively, it can come under renewed pressure. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or ₹195 over the medium term. The region around ₹195 is a strong long-term support which can halt the downtrend that has been in place since November last year. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go short at current levels and on rallies at ₹245. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹265 for the target of ₹200. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹240 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹225.










 ITC (₹282.1)
ITC was volatile last week. The stock has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹276 and ₹290 over the last three weeks. Last week’s candle on the weekly chart reflects indecisiveness in the market. This leaves the short-term outlook unclear for the stock. A breakout on either side of ₹276 or ₹290 will decide the next move. If ITC declines below ₹276, it can fall to test the ₹269-₹267 support region. A bounce from this support zone will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹280 and ₹285 again. But a strong break below ₹267can drag the stock lower to ₹260 or even ₹255. On the other hand, if ITC manages to sustain above ₹276 in the coming days and breaches ₹290, it can move higher to ₹296 initially. Inability to break above ₹296 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹289. But a strong break above ₹296 will see the stock rallying to ₹303 or ₹305. Such a rally will also mark the end of the downtrend that has been in place since last July. Long-term investors can hold the long positions.










 Infosys (₹1,183.7)
Infosys has been testing the psychological level of ₹1,200 over the last four consecutive weeks. However, the stock seems to be lacking fresh buyers to take it decisively above ₹1,200. It has been facing strong resistance around ₹1,210. A strong break above this hurdle is needed for Infosys to gain fresh momentum. Such a break will see Infosys testing the previous highs of ₹1,278 levels. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 and ₹1,375 levels over the medium term. On the other hand, if Infosys continues to remain below ₹1,200, a fall to ₹1,160 is possible in the near term. It will keep the broader ₹1,100-₹1,200 sideways range intact. The stock has been stuck in this range since January. Further break below ₹1,160 can drag the stock to ₹1,140 or ₹1,135. A bounce from ₹1,135 can trigger a relief rally to ₹1,160 or ₹1,170. But a strong break below ₹1,135 will see Infosys falling towards ₹1,100. Further fall below ₹1,100 is unlikely. Both medium- and long-term investors can hold the long positions.










 RIL (₹933.4)
RIL tumbled over 5 per cent last week. The stock hovers above an immediate support level of ₹929 — the 21-week moving average. This support has been limiting the downside over the last four weeks. If RIL manages to sustain above this support and reverse higher, it can move up to test ₹1,000 levels again. Inability to break above ₹1,000 can continue to keep the stock range-bound between ₹929 and ₹1,000 for some more time. But a strong break above ₹1,000 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹1,030 or ₹1,035. The region between ₹1,030 and ₹1,035 is a crucial medium-term resistance for the stock. Whether RIL breaks above ₹1,035 or not will be key in deciding the next move. On the other hand, if RIL breaks below the immediate support level of ₹929, it can fall to ₹900 or ₹890 in the coming days. A crucial medium-term trend deciding support is poised around ₹890. A decisive weekly close below ₹890 may trigger a sharp corrective fall to ₹850. So the price action around ₹890 will need a close watch.










 Tata Steel (₹591.5)
Tata Steel surged, breaking above the key ₹615-₹620 resistance region last week, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made an intra-week high of ₹636.3 and reversed sharply lower, giving back all the gains made and closed 2.5 per cent lower for the week. Technically, the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance at ₹631 has halted the up-move and triggered the reversal. This indicates that the downtrend that has been in place since January is intact. Immediate resistance is inbetween ₹600 and ₹605. Inability to bounce from the current levels and breach this hurdle can continue to keep the stock under pressure. A fall to ₹570-₹565 is likely. If Tata Steel manages to bounce from ₹565 to ₹570, a relief rally to ₹600 is possible. But a break below ₹565 can drag the stock to ₹550. Traders with high risk appetite can go short on rallies at ₹598 and ₹605. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹615 for the target of ₹570. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹590 when it moves down to ₹580."
210,2018-05-30,Reliance,"Reliance to halt Iran oil imports as US sanctions take effect
Reliance Industries Ltd, (RIL) owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a sign that new US sanctions are forcing buyers to shun oil purchases from Tehran.
The move by Reliance’s flagship company, expected to take effect in October or November, came after US President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear agreement this month and ordered the reimposition of US sanctions on Tehran.
Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on August 6, and the rest, notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on November 4.
India has said it does not follow US sanctions but companies with links to the US financial system could be liable to penalties if they do not comply.
Reliance, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of the US, where it operates some subsidiaries that are linked to its oil and telecom businesses among others.
Reliance, whose modern refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat can process about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, has told officials of the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) that the firm would stop oil imports from Tehran in October or November, one of the sources said.
A second source said the company could halt imports from Iran earlier than that if European nations and Tehran failed to salvage the nuclear deal.
This source said that some insurance companies have asked Reliance to end exposure to Iran before November.
Global insurers have already warned about doing business with Iran while some shipping lines have said they would not take new bookings for Iran.
The United States has threatened to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran.
In the interim period until it stops buying Iranian oil, Reliance has asked NIOC to supply Iranian oil in vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), the sources said.
The sources did not wish to be identified as the matter is sensitive. Reliance did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment.
In 2017, Reliance’s oil imports from Iran surged by about 45 percent to 67,000 bpd, according to ship tracking data. In Jan-April 2018, the company has imported about 96,000 bpd.
Rethinking dealings
Washington’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal has spurred global insurers and other companies to rethink their dealings in Iran as they await further guidance from the United States and European Union.
Earlier this month French energy giant Total said it might quit a multi-billion-dollar gas project if it could not secure a waiver from US sanctions.
Italy’s Eni, which last June signed a provisional agreement with Tehran to conduct oil and gas feasibility studies, has said it had no plans for new projects in Iran.
Reliance, which deals with some of the top-notch foreign bankers with huge exposure to the US financial system, exports fuel to the country and imports ethane from there for its petrochemical plants.
Trade sources have said Reliance recently bought up to 8 million barrels of US crude.
After a gap of six years, Reliance resumed purchases from Iran in 2016 when Western powers eased restrictions on trade with Iran in return for the OPEC member agreeing to end its disputed nuclear programme."

BL13_RELIANCE_RETAIL




BL13_RELIANCE_RETAIL


Reliance Retail, a part of the diversified conglomerate Reliance Industries, plans to capture a lion’s share of the $60 billion organised Indian retail market. Of this, the Mukesh Ambani-led retail giant alone contributes about $10 billion and is the first company to have crossed that milestone number in fiscal 2018.
In a bid to become the largest company and keep pace with the market growth, the company is charting aggressive expansion plans. In its 2017-18 annual report, the company has mentioned that it will further consolidate its leadership position through a four-pronged strategy—expanding geographical reach into smaller towns, innovating more concept stores, going omni-channel and leveraging technology and data analytics.
Reliance Retail, which operates over 7,573 brick-and-mortar stores across 4,400 cities, said that it has been augmenting geographical reach across all consumption baskets and has the ambition of reaching the hinterlands of the country and is putting together a framework of expanding each store concepts across tier-2, tier-3 cities and beyond to achieve market leadership by leveraging its digital business Reliance Jio.
In the last fiscal, the company rolled out and expanded newer store concepts like Project Eve, Trends Woman, Qwik Mart, a new convenience store concept, co-located with Reliance Petro Retail outlets among several others.
“These newer concepts are already resonating with target customers. In order to cater to growing and diverse customer needs, Reliance Retail will continue to innovate and partner with revered international brands to bring world-class products and services to Indian consumers,” the report added.
The company also plans to converge its offline and online business by the way of omni-channel strategy to offer seamless experience to their customers. It is already operating a connected store concept providing anytime, anywhere, any device-seamless customer experience. The company plans to roll out more initiatives in a phased manner during the fiscal.
“The year saw our consumer businesses attain a threshold, where from they will start contributing meaningfully to consolidated profits. From a mere 2 per cent in FY 2016-17, Jio and Retail accounted for 13.1 per cent of RIL’s consolidated Segment EBITDA in FY 2017-18. This was achieved notwithstanding a sharp 33.6 per cent spurt in consolidated EBITDA to ₹74,184 crore. Our aim is to have the consumer businesses contribute on par with the energy and materials business over the next decade, when we celebrate our Golden Jubilee,” said RIL’s Chairman Mukesh Ambani.
Reliance Retail, India’s largest retailer by revenue and profitability, has grown over 45 per cent annually for the last five years and operates in four key consumption baskets—Grocery, Consumer Electronics & Connectivity, Fashion & Lifestyle, and Fuel Retail. The company has been growing at a faster pace than the market. According to an industry report, India’s retail market is expected to increase by 60 per cent to reach $1.1 trillion by 2020, on the back of factors like rising incomes and lifestyle changes by middle class and increased digital connectivity.
While the overall retail market is expected to grow at 12 per cent per annum, modern trade would expand twice as fast at 20 per cent per annum and traditional trade at 10 per cent. Indian retail market is divided into “Organised Retail Market” which is valued at $60 billion which is only 9 per cent of the total sector and “Unorganised Retail Market” constitutes the rest 91 per cent of the sector."

Supports could limit the downside in SBI(₹277.5)
SBI rallied as expected last week to test the key resistance level of ₹285. The stock surged over 6 per cent during intra-week to mark a high of ₹289.3. But SBI fell from this high, giving back most of the gains and closed 1.8 per cent higher for the week. The near-term view is negative. The stock can test the immediate support at ₹273. A break below this support can pull the stock lower to ₹270. Further break below ₹270 will increase the likelihood of the stock declining to ₹265 or even ₹262 in the short term. On the other hand, if SBI manages to reverse higher from ₹273 or ₹270, the downside pressure would ease. In such a scenario, the stock can rally to revisit ₹285 levels. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹285 will confirm the end of the downtrend that has been in place since last November. It will then pave way for SBI to target ₹310 and ₹320 levels. Indicators on the charts signal that the downside could be limited in SBI.










Bearish outlook is intact in ITC (₹264.5)
ITC was down for the fifth consecutive week. The stock surged to a high of ₹274 in the initial part of the week, but failed to sustain higher. It reversed sharply lower from its high, giving back all the gains made during the week. The fall has dragged the stock decisively below the 200-day moving average, which has been providing strong support over the last couple of weeks. ITC looks vulnerable to break below the immediate support at ₹263.5 and may fall to ₹260 or ₹258 in the coming days. The price action on the chart keeps the bearish outlook intact. The fall over the last five weeks indicates that the broader ₹250-₹290 sideways range is intact. ITC has been stuck in this sideways range for a prolonged period of time since last August. A fall to test ₹250 is possible in the coming weeks. However, such a fall is a good buying opportunity for long-term investors as a break below ₹250 is unlikely. Investors can hold the long positions and accumulate on dips at ₹255 and ₹252. Retain the stop-loss at ₹220.










Key resistance is ahead for Infosys (₹1,280.4)
Infosys surged to record highs in the past week, as expected. The stock recorded a high of ₹1,290 and has come-off slightly to close 1.6 per cent higher for the week. A key resistance is in the ₹1,295-₹1,300 region, which is likely to be tested in the near term. But whether Infosys breaks above this hurdle or not will decide the next move. Inability to breach ₹1,300 can trigger a short-term corrective fall. A pull-back from ₹1,300 can drag the stock lower to ₹1,250 or ₹1,230 on the back of profit-booking. However, the downside in the stock is expected to be limited as fresh buying interest is likely to emerge at lower levels. Strong support is at around ₹1,200. The outlook will turn negative only if the stock breaks below this support. But this looks unlikely. As such, an eventual break above ₹1,300 will boost the momentum. This can take the stock up to ₹1,370. From a long-term perspective, Infosys is likely to target ₹1,450. Both medium and long-term investors can hold their long positions.










RIL hovers below a crucial resistance (₹1,013.8)
RIL surged over 3 per cent last week. The stock has been rallying consistently over the last three weeks and is up about 10 per cent. A key short-term resistance is at ₹1,023. If RIL manages to breach this hurdle, the current rally can extend to ₹1,040 or ₹1,045 in the near term. Further break above ₹1,045 will pave way for the next target of ₹1,100 and higher levels. But inability to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹1,023 will increase the likelihood of a corrective fall in the coming days. A pull-back from ₹1,023 will drag the stock lower to ₹990. Further break below ₹990 will drag RIL lower to ₹965 or even ₹950 in the short term. Such a fall will keep the ₹870-₹1,020 sideways range intact. But indicators on the charts are bullish. The 21-day moving average is turning around after just testing the 55-day moving average. This is a positive signal, indicating that the downside could be limited. As such the possibility is high of the stock breaking above ₹1,023 and rallying to ₹1,045.










Immediate outlook is mixed for Tata Steel(₹565.9)
Tata Steel tumbled 6 per cent in the past week. The stock has been volatile over the last few weeks, moving up one week and falling in the next. This leaves the near-term outlook mixed for the stock. The stock can remain range-bound between ₹550 and ₹610 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹550 or ₹610 will then determine the next trend. Traders can stay out of this stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges. A strong break above ₹610 can take Tata Steel higher to ₹635 or ₹650 in the short term. A break above ₹650 is required to mark the end of the corrective fall that has been in place since late January. The stock can then target ₹680 and ₹700 levels again. On the other hand, if Tata Steel breaks below ₹550 in the coming days, it can fall to ₹539 — a key 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement support level. A break below this support can drag it to ₹525. Such a fall will strengthen the downtrend and drag the stock to ₹500 or ₹470."

Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries (RIL), has signed an agreement to raise $1 billion term loan facility covered by Korea Trade Insurance Corp (K-Sure). This is K-Sure’s largest deal in India and the largest deal supported by K-Sure in the global telecom sector.
The loan will be mainly used to finance goods and services procured from Samsung Electronics and Ace Technologies Corp. This is the second round of funding for RJio backed by K-Sure and fourth for Reliance Group, RJio said in a statement.
The term loan has door-to-door tenor of 10.75 years, it added.
The financing was arranged by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. BNP Paribas, Commerzbank AG, Citibank N.A, ING Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, Mizuho Bank, MUFG Bank and Banco Santander were also part of the fund raising.
RJio will use the funding to build a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network across the country. Samsung Electronics had signed an agreement with RJio in 2012 to supply LTE network equipment, including core infrastructure such as base stations and Voice over LTE services to installation of telecom networks.
In October 2017, RJio had raised $750 million loan from Korea Exim Bank to finance of telecom equipment purchase from Samsung Electronics. Later in November, RJio announced plans to raise $1.5 billion from 26 banks to finance terms taken in 2010.
RJio, which had launched telecom operations in 2016, is now one of the top two players across 18 telecom circles of the total 22 in the country. The company has posted a 19.8 per cent rise in market share in the fourth quarter from the 15.2 per cent recorded during the previous quarter, according to statistics released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India earlier this month.
In December, Mukesh Ambani-led RJio entered into an agree to acquire the wireless assets of debt-laden Reliance Communications (RCom), controlled by his younger sibling, Anil. This was one of a series of deals between the two brothers – Mukesh and Anil – who had parted ways in 2005, carving the Reliance empire into two."

201,2018-07-02,Reliance,"Reliance Jio cries foul over tender rules of govt-funded telecom projects 
Reliance Jio has alleged that tender norms mandating use of 2G technology for government-funded mobile service projects will favour incumbent operators and cause financial loss of around ₹5,000 crore to the exchequer, according to sources.
The Mukesh Ambani-led firm has also written a letter to Universal Service Obligation Fund Administrator Sanjay Singh and marked it to Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha and Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan seeking their intervention for removing the clause.
“...We are hugely disappointed by USOF Administration’s decision to continue with extremely unfair, arbitrary, discriminatory, restrictive and retrograde mandate to use 2G technology for voice in its recent tender for Andaman and Nicobar Islands despite numerous reasons for not mandating a legacy technology,” RJio said in the letter, seen by PTI, dated June 25, 2018.
The Telecom Department in June first week invited bids to install 214 mobile towers in Andaman and Nicobar islands (ANI) in uncovered villages and on national highways for providing 2G and 4G services. The project will be funded by the government through USOF, which is corpus created from money paid by telecom subscribers as part of their every call.
RJio said that mandatory 2G rollout is discriminatory in nature and is bound to prohibit participation of 4G operators in the bid.
RJio in the letter alleged that the project with mandatory use of 2G technology will be used by incumbent operator with 2G networks to deploy their old and wasted network equipment in ANI while they upgrade their networks to 4G in other parts of the country.
The USOF wing, which is managing the project, has also proposed similar clause for telecom connectivity project in Naxal affected states and unconnected villages in the North-East.
RJio representatives in pre-bid meeting held on June 19 have alleged that the extension of clause for telecom infrastructure rollout project in Naxal-affected area and Meghalaya alone will add to ₹5,000-crore financial loss to the public exchequer.
“The restriction on latest technology would also impact cost efficiencies as there will be at least 30-40 per cent incremental cost addition...For example, in ANI tender itself, the government could save around ₹100 crore and possibly more, if this restrictive condition of the tender gets removed,” the letter said.
It said that 2G has reached to its end of life, where a large number of developed and developing countries have already completely switched off their 2G networks and over 75,000 mobile towers on 2G technology have been shut down in India.
“With no advantage in terms of additional service or otherwise, the present bid condition for mandatory 2G rollout is bound to cause additional losses in both capex as well as opex,” the letter said.
RJio played down arguments of USOF, which comes under the Telecom Department, that 2G is required for economical handsets and point-of-sales machines.
It said that areas to be covered under USOF project are uncovered areas and therefore there is no likelihood of any customer within these areas holding a 2G only handset and at present there is almost nil differential in 2G and 4G handset prices.
“The tender, in the current form, is bound to result in virtual monopoly of few incumbent operators, causing huge loss to the tune of thousands of crores to the exchequer,” the letter said."

After shaking the mobile telephony market with free voice calls and dirt cheap data, the richest Indian, Mukesh Ambani, today announced plans to launch ultra high speed fixed line broadband services for homes and enterprises.
Speaking at the company’s 41st annual general meeting, Ambani said the service would provide ultra high definition entertainment on TV, voice activated assistance, virtual reality gaming and digital shopping as well as smart home solutions.
“We will now extend fibre connectivity to homes, merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises simultaneously across 1,100 cities to offer the most advanced fibre-based broadband connectivity solutions,” he said.
Jio, the company’s telecom service, will move India to the top five nations in fixed line broadband in the coming year, Ambani said. Its launch in September 2016 has made India the highest mobile data consuming nation.
Ambani said since its launch, Jio has amassed 215 million customers and has sold over 25 million Jio phones. The Jio phone, which was offered on payment of are fundable security deposit only, will provide Whatsapp, Facebook and Youtube commercially from August 15 this year, he said.
Fixed line broadband will offer “ultra high-definition entertainment on large screen TVs, multi-party video conferencing from your living room, voice-activated virtual assistants, virtual reality gaming, digital shopping and immersive experiences,” he said. The service will be called ‘Jio GigaFiber Service’
Ambani targets 100 million Jio phone users in the ‘shortest possible time’. Registration for fixed line broadband service will begin from August 15, Ambani said.
He also announced the Jio Phone Monsoon Hungama starting July 21, where feature phones could be exchanged for Jio Phone for Rs 501. Reliance, he said, has reached an inflection point with consumer business contributing as much as its energy and petrochemical.

198,2018-07-05,Reliance,"Why RJio’s optical fibre plan will be biggest game changer
Ever since Reliance Jio launched its wireless mobile services in 2016, telecom sector has witnessed disruptions on many counts. Data tariffs have hit rock bottom levels, consumption of video and Internet-based stories has seen phenomenal growth, the industry has consolidated to 3-4 players forcing many small players to shut shop and the surviving operators have stepped up customer service like never before in a bid to retain market share.
However, the biggest disruption in telecom is just about to happen with RJio announcing plans to roll out optical fibre-based broadband services across 1,100 cities. There are many reasons why an optical fibre network will trump the wireless mobile revolution witnessed by the country so far.








 
First, data consumption is growing at an exponential rate and it will soon reach a scale where mobile networks will not be able to support it using just radio frequency spectrum.
“Optical fibre is the future. Mobile technologies will be relevant for carrying small data services like email and basic browsing but the big shift we are seeing is the huge uptake of data for entertainment and video services. This requires optical fibre which has the capability to carry terabytes of data,” said an executive from Reliance.
“The RJio cable network will have next generation services running on it and will change the market dynamics,” he added. According to a Nokia MbIT 2018 report, 4G consumption per user (there are 420 million of them) reached 11 GB per month in December 2017, of which video content used up to 65 per cent of the total mobile data traffic.
While this massive uptake of data has been driven by smartphones, optical fibre networks are crucial for securing India’s broadband future. As data consumption keeps growing exponentially and with new technologies such as 5G on the way, wireless platforms will not be enough to meet the demands of bandwidth-guzzling consumers.
Second, critical services such as healthcare and education are slowly moving online for which a reliable broadband network is required. Existing mobile networks are patchy and not resilient enough for mission critical services. By leveraging on the digital connectivity, RJio overtime also wants to focus on these large opportunities.








 
“RJio is looking to provide affordable and quality healthcare to Indians. While management acknowledges that it is a long gestation opportunity, it believes it would create significant value over time,” said a report by Bank of America Merill Lynch
“Through RJio, RIL is looking to connect 58,000 colleges/universities and 1.9 million schools to provide broadband and help provide education to nearly 200 million students ,” it added.
RJio is the only player which has rolled out a network that will support the huge growth in data. RJio’s optical fibre network will be the largest broadband network as other players in the country have such a network only in about 100 top cities.
State-run BSNL has a wider fixed network but most of it is based on copper and not optical fibre. The Government-sponsored BharatNet will be a crucial element as it has rolled out public infrastructure to villages.
If RJio can connect its network to BharatNet then its disruption will go beyond the 1,100 cities."

The 41st annual general meeting of Reliance Industries (RIL) yet again caught the imagination of stock market traders who are anticipating another round of tariff war, this time in the cable TV segment. 
On Thursday, selling pressure in Hathway Cable, Siti, Den Networks and Sun TV was high as RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced that they had launched ultra high speed fixed line broadband services for homes and enterprises under the brand ‘JioGigaFibre’. 
Shares of cable TV operators were down in the range of 2.7 to 15 per cent post the announcement. 
“RIL is ruthlessly aggressive and the experience of Jio phone network is proof that fibre TV network too could give a run to other players for their money. Share price of cable TV companies including DTH players may remain under pressure for months to come. See what has happened to the share price of Idea and Bharti from a couple of years ago. You will know the fate of cable TV company shares’ prices in the months to come,” said a Managing Director of a Mumbai-based brokerage and research house. 
Siti Network was down 2.76 per cent, Hathway fell 15.4 per cent, Den 10.7 per cent and SunTV was down 2.76 per cent."

 Reliance Industries Ltd, India’s most valued company, is seeking to “future-proof” its hydrocarbon portfolio as renewable energy finds currency in the country and abroad, its Chairman Mukesh Ambani said on Thursday. 
“We have a complete plan to further increase the level of integration by adding new chemical chains and capacity to produce new materials and composites of high value,” Ambani told shareholders at the company’s 41st annual general meeting, in Mumbai on Thursday. “This will minimise the impact of renewables and electricity on transportation fuels,” he said.
RIL said it was nearing the end of its largest-ever investment at its Jamnagar refinery complex in Gujarat.
The investment helped Jamnagar emerge as the world’s largest manufacturing facility for Paraxylene — a key raw material to make other industrial chemicals. With a 4.2-million tonne capacity, Reliance is now at the second spot globally among Paraxylene producers.
The opening of the world’s largest off-gas cracker complex positions Reliance as one of the most efficient producers of polymers. Further, the Petcoke gasification project will eliminate the dependence of the refinery on imported natural gas and add value to its profitability, particularly in a high oil price scenario, Ambani said.
These new projects have redefined the oil-to-chemicals integration, which Reliance began in the late 1990s.
“As the world migrates from fossil fuels to renewable energy, we will further maximise oil-to-chemicals conversion and upgrade all of our fuels to high-value petrochemicals. This upgradation will be implemented in a phased manner over the next decade to meet the rapidly increasing demand for petrochemicals in India and the region. The hydrocarbon business is thus poised for robust value creation. It will play a catalytic role in determining profitability of hydrocarbons businesses of the future,” the RIL Chairman stated.
The company will commission the butyl rubber project later this year, besides adding composites and carbon-fibre to its portfolio, Ambani said. 
“These high-value materials will cater to the growing needs of India’s transportation and alternate energy sectors,” Ambani said, adding that the value-chain integration will allow Reliance to create “an annuity-like cash flow with lower risk of cyclical markets”.
Reliance and its joint venture partner BP plc will look to start gas production from the KG-D6 Block in 2020 and reach full production of 30-35 million metric standard cubic metres per day by 2022, he said. 
Reliance is also weighing a cross-border merger of Reliance Holding USA (RHUSA) with RIL to integrate the gas resources in America with the Indian market, Ambani said, adding that BP plc was pursuing opportunities to source and distribute gas to Indian consumers."

 Intending to put India among the top five nations in mobility and broadband connectivity, Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio) has unveiled a plan to expand its optical fibre network simultaneously across 1,100 cities. 
The company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-helmed Reliance Industries (RIL), will offer high-speed broadband under the brand, JioGigaFiber.
RJio also unveiled JioPhone 2 priced at ₹2,999, which will be available from August 15, and launched a ‘Monsoon Hungama’ a scheme, under which existing feature phone users can exchange their feature for a new JioPhone for ₹501.
“In countries with better developed communication infrastructure, more than 80 per cent of data consumption happens indoors through fixed-line connectivity in homes, offices and other premises. Optical fibre-based fixed-line broadband is the future,” Ambani said, addressing shareholders at RIL’s 41st AGM.
“Fixed-line broadband offers hundreds of megabits, even gigabits per second of data speeds. Jio is determined to move India to among the top 5 in fixed-line broadband,” he said, adding JioGigaFiber, which is now undergoing beta trials in many many homes, would be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband roll out anywhere in the world.
RJio, which has invested more than ₹2,50,000 crores to create digital infrastructure and now will extend this fibre footprint to homes, merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises. Registrations for JioGigaFiber would start from August 15.
The digital initiatives of the company were then demonstrated by Ambani’s daughter Isha and son Akash."

Goldman Sachs analysts say lack of clarity on exact launch timeline and tariffs of fixed-line services could suggest limited near-term impact on home broadband/DTH players. “Unlike the previous two AGMs of RIL, we believe the overall impact of this year's announcements are likely to be less severe for telcos vs prior years,” they say.
Jefferies says that for Jio to expand the market for JioFiber, pricing will need to be aggressive and “roll-out will likely be gradual as last mile connection takes time”.
CLSA says amid renewed risks of subscriber churn, Bharti Airtel's ability to drive adoption of data will be key to its ARPU recovery; Vodafone-Idea Cellular Ltd also face similar risks.
Reliance Industries shares were up 1.6 per cent, while Airtel down 0.7 per cent and Idea Cellular up 0.8 per cent. Rival broadband providers tanked for second session with Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd down 8.5 per cent and DEN Networks Ltd down 6.2 per cent.

 Shareholders of Reliance Industries have approved giving Mukesh Ambani another five years as the Chairman and Managing Director of the company.
 Ambani, 61, has been on the board of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) since 1977 and was elevated as Chairman of the company after the death of his father and group patriarch Dhirubhai Ambani in July 2002.
 The company put a resolution to re-appoint Ambani “for a period of five years, on expiry of his present term of office, i.e with effect from April 19, 2019” at the 41st Annual General Meeting held on July 5 in Mumbai.
 As many as 50,818 crore shares out of a total share base of 616.45 crore voted on the resolution, RIL said in a regulatory filing. Of the votes polled, 98.5 per cent were in favour of the resolution while 1.48 voted against it.
 According to the resolution, Ambani will be paid an annual salary of Rs 4.17 crore and Rs 59 lakh of perquisites and allowances. Retirement benefits are not included in the overall ceiling of remuneration.
 He will also be entitled to receive bonus based on net profits and “expenses incurred for travelling, boarding and lodging, including for spouse and attendant(s) during business trips and provision of car(s) for use on company’s business and communication expenses at residence shall be reimbursed at actuals and not considered as perquisites,” it said.
 Also, “the expenses, as may be borne by the company for providing security to Shri Mukesh D Ambani and his family members shall not be considered as perquisites and accordingly, not to be included for the purpose of computation of the overall ceiling of remuneration,” the resolution, which was carried at the AGM, said.
 At the AGM, shareholders also allowed RIL to raise up to Rs 20,000 crore through a non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue in 2018-19, according to the regulatory filing."

Reliance Industries today reclaimed the $100-billion m-cap mark, as the company shares hit a 52-week high of Rs 1,099 on both the bourses.
The energy-to-telecoms conglomerate led by Mukesh Ambani, had earlier breached the $100-billion mark way back in 2007 when the rupee was at 39.5 against the US dollar. In rupee terms, the company’s market capitalisation then stood at Rs 4.11 lakh crore.
The country's biggest software services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, was the first Indian tech company to hit the $100-billion mark in April.
RIL shares hit a 52-week high of Rs 1,099 owing to aggressive business expansion plan announced at the AGM last week ahead of June quarter earnings.








 
The stock jumped for the fifth straight session today. After opening at Rs 1,043.15, the stock touched its 52-week high of Rs 1,099, up 6.02 per cent over its previous closing price.
Following the uptick in the counter, the market capitalisation (m-cap) of the company touched Rs 6,88,513.11 crore (around $100 billion).
Similar movement was seen on the NSE, where the stock opened at Rs 1,044.35, then surged 5.8 per cent to touch a 52-week high of Rs 1,099. RIL shares ended higher by 4.42 per cent at Rs 1,082.20 on the BSE. On the NSE, the stock closed up by 4.05 per cent at Rs 1,080.90.








 
Ultra high speed broadband services
After shaking the mobile telephony market with free voice calls and dirt cheap data, RIL Chairman, Mukesh Ambani, had last week announced plans to launch ultra high speed fixed line broadband services for homes and enterprises.
Speaking at the company’s 41st annual general meeting, Ambani said the service would provide ultra high definition entertainment on TV, voice activated assistance, virtual reality gaming and digital shopping as well as smart home solutions.

The broader Nifty index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), which is still 148 points away from its all-time high, closed the day at 11,023, a gain of 75 points, or 0.68 per cent.
RIL, after last week’s announcement to aggressively pursue optic fibre broadband and cable TV services, reclaimed its position in the $100-billion club after a gap of nearly 10 years. The company’s scrip rose 4.42 per cent to close at ₹1,082.
The rally in RIL shares has reportedly increased promoter Mukesh Ambani’s wealth to more than $42 billion. He owns 47 per cent of RIL, which has seen a bull run since the launch of Jio’s telecom operations in 2016.
Easing global crude oil prices boosted sentiment in India’s equity market. Brent crude fell to $73.40 a barrel during the previous trading session. “The level of 10,900 is the key support for Nifty index,” said VK Sharma, Head Private Client Group & Capital Market Strategy at HDFC Securities.
 
“The latest World Bank report, which stated that India had become the world’s sixth-largest economy surpassing France, triggered an upbeat start for equity markets on Thursday, which further strengthened with favourable global cues,” said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking.
He added: “Things began falling in place with the upbeat start of the earnings season, but global negatives — the trade war scenario and [higher] crude oil prices may continue to cause trouble in between.

 The government has moved Delhi High Court to enforce a USD 3.8 billion recovery from Reliance Industries, Shell and ONGC following an English court ruling over its share from the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields in western offshore, said Dharmendra Pradhan, Oil Minister today.
 The liability is to be split between the three companies in proportion to their stake in the fields. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has 40 per cent interest while RIL and Shell hold 30 per cent each.
 In a written reply in Rajya Sabha, Pradhan said that based on the Final Partial Award (FPA) dated October 12, 2016, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had on May 25, 2017, raised demand for USD 3.8 billion on ONGC, RIL and Shell towards government of India share of profit petroleum and royalty.
 RIL and Shell challenged the FPA before the High Court in London. ONGC was not party to the arbitration.
 “The High Court, London rejected the petition filed by RIL and Shell on April 16, 2018, except on one issue which was remanded to the Arbitral Tribunal,” he said. “For enforcement of the FPA, Government has filed a petition before the Delhi High Court.” 
In December 2010, BG Exploration & Production India Ltd, which was subsequently acquired by Shell, and RIL, initiated an arbitration against the Government of India (GoI) after a dispute over the state’s share of profit and royalty from Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti contract areas off the west coast.
 The Arbitration Tribunal gave its FPA on October 12, 2016. RIL and Shell initiated proceedings under English Arbitration Act 1996 to challenge the arbitration award before the English Commercial Court in November 2016.
 On May 2, 2018, the Court delivered its final judgement, remitting a significant issue for redetermination by the Tribunal within three months while disposing of eight other issues, RIL had said on May 24.
 “The Arbitration Tribunal has scheduled a hearing to determine the remitted issue and will thereafter deliver an award,” it had said.
 It had insisted that before taking up the issue of quantification of liability, the Tribunal has to decide the issue which is remitted by the English court to it.
 BG-RIL propose to file an application to the Tribunal for the increase of Cost Recovery Limit which they are entitled to do under the Production Sharing Contracts.
 “Tribunal can consider the issue of quantification of liability (if any) only after these two issues are decided,” RIL said. “Several issues relating to the claim made by GOI are subject to pending arbitration proceedings.” 
Pradhan said, “out of the four arbitration initiated by RIL in respect of its Krishna Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6, only two are under adjudication.”
 The firm has withdrawn the arbitration against a delay in notifying a gas price and the one against taking away of some area in the KG-D6 block after the expiry of stipulated time frame.
“The arbitrations under adjudication include one against the government disallowing certain costs for KG-D6 output not meeting the targets because of non-drilling of stipulated wells,” he said.
“The second arbitration is against the government seeking compensation from RIL and its partners for producing natural gas belonging to state-owned ONGC,” he added."

The June 2018 quarter scorecard of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reflects the company’s ongoing aggressive focus in its key consumer-facing business — digital and retail — in line with the objective of increasing their share to that of the oil and allied businesses.
Digital and retail continued to grow at a blistering pace; together, they now contribute more than a fifth of the company’s overall operating profit.
Revenue from the digital business (RJio) in the June quarter was close to ₹10,000 crore from just about ₹150 crore in the year-ago period. Also, for the third consecutive quarter, the segment remained the company’s third largest in terms of operating profit (₹1,715 crore).
Subscriber base
It had posted operating loss of ₹22 crore in the year-ago period and profit of ₹1,495 crore in the March 2018 quarter. Even as its peers reel due to its disruptive tactics, RJio’s rapid growth has been driven by continued increase in the subscriber base to 215.3 million (as of June 2018), growing data usage by subscribers and healthy ARPU (about ₹20 more than Bharti Airtel).
The retail business too delivered strongly with revenue more than doubling and operating profit nearly quadrupling YoY to ₹1,069 crore in the June quarter. This was aided by continued store additions, growth across various retail segments and expansion in margins.
Completing the trifecta yet again for RIL, third quarter in a row, was the petrochemicals segment — the company’s largest profit contributor. Aided by strong volume growth and improvement in margins, the segment’s June quarter sales grew nearly 60 per cent YoY and profit almost doubled to ₹7,857 crore.
Weakness in refining
The strong show by these three businesses again helped offset the weakness in the refining, and oil & gas exploration segments. Operating profit in the refining business fell nearly 17 per cent YoY to ₹5,315 crore. This was due to a decline in gross refining margin to $10.5 a barrel from $11.9 a barrel in the year-ago period, in line with the dip in the Singapore benchmark. Lower crude processing added to the pain. But refining similar to petrochemicals is a cyclical business with periodic ups and downs.
The oil and gas exploration business continued to languish due to declining volumes, locally and internationally. This resulted in the segment’s operating loss widening to ₹447 crore from ₹373 crore in the year-ago period. The loss though was lower than in the March 2018 quarter (₹600 crore).








 
Overall, the company’s adjusted profit grew about 18 per cent YoY to ₹9,459 crore. The profit growth, while healthy, was much slower than the nearly 57 per cent revenue rise, reflecting the impact of lower refining margins, and higher depreciation and interest costs, a result of the huge expansions in the consumer-facing and petrochemicals businesses. The company’s financial position remains robust with cash and equivalents at nearly ₹79,000 crore.
The RIL stock has been going from strength to strength over the past year or so, and the good show in the June quarter should provide support to the stock."

MUKESH AMBANI, CMD, RIL


 Inching towards the ₹10,000-crore mark, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) posted a consolidated net profit of ₹9,459 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, boosted by higher realisations from the refining and petrochemical businesses. The conglomerate, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, had recorded a net profit of ₹8,021 crore, excluding exceptional items, in the comparable year-ago quarter.
For the April-June quarter of FY18, the oil-to-telecom company’s net profit stood at ₹9,108 crore, including a ₹1,087-crore profit from a stake divestment in Gulf Africa Petroleum Corp. While net profit rose 17.9 per cent, excluding exceptional items, it posted a meagre 3.85 per cent rise including the exceptional item. 
“Our petrochemicals business generated record EBITDA with strong volumes and an upswing in polyester chain margins. Refining business performance remained steady despite the seasonal weakness in cracks. Continuing strength in the global demand for oil products and the implementation of more stringent environmental norms for marine fuels augur well for our refining business,” said Ambani, RIL’s CMD. 
In the quarter under review, RIL’s consolidated revenue rose 56.5 per cent to ₹1.42 lakh crore from the ₹90,537 crore posted in the year-ago period, as revenue from operations jumped 46.98 per cent to ₹1.33 lakh crore.
“RIL’s consumer businesses — RJio and Reliance Retail — now contribute about 21 per cent of the company’s total revenue. RJio now has about 250 million users, while retail expanded to about 800 stores in this quarter itself,” said RIL’s Joint CFO V Srikanth. 
On a standalone basis, net profit rose 7.6 per cent to ₹8,820 crore (from ₹8,196 crore) on operational revenue of ₹95,472 crore (₹70,434 crore). The company's revenue from the refining and marketing business during the first quarter rose 42.9 per cent to ₹95,646 crore (₹66,945 crore). The gross refining margins — earnings from turning a barrel of crude oil into refined products — fell to $10.5 per barrel from $11.9 a year ago, impacted by higher crude prices. 
RJio net rises 20%
RJio, the company’s wholly-owned wireless subsidiary, posted a 19.9 per cent rise in net profit at ₹612 crore for the June quarter, compared with ₹510 crore recorded during the sequential quarter ended March. The earnings rose on a growth in subscriber additions and higher data usage.
The comparable figures were not available as the telecom operator had started commercial operations in June last year.
“We doubled our customer base and most user metrics in the last 12 months; 215 million customers within 22 months of start is a record that no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world,” Ambani said.
During the quarter, RJio’s average revenue per user stood at ₹134.5 per month, while its subscriber net addition stood at 28.7 million."

 The cash-rich Reliance Industries, which also is one of the biggest forex loan borrowers in the country, is set to tap the foreign debt market to raise USD 2.7 billion to refinance its existing high cost debt.
 As of the June 2018 quarter, the Mukesh Ambani-led company had an outstanding debt of Rs 2,42,116 crore, which rose from Rs 2,18,763 crore from March 2018, while cash in hand marginally rose to Rs 79,492 crore.
 The company had spent around Rs 22,000 crore in capex during the quarter mostly into the still cash-burning telecom venture, and reported a net income of Rs 9,459 crore. Its outstanding debt has been rising as its fledgling telecom business continues to drain cash.
“We are planning to raise USD 2.7 billion in forex debt through the course of the fiscal 2019. The money will be raised in multiple tranches and will be used to refinance some of our existing high cost forex debt,” a senior company official told PTI over the weekend refusing to reveal more information.
 More than half of Reliance’s around USD 34 billion debt is due for repayment by 2022, while around USD 13 billion is maturing from 2018 through 2020. Most of the outstanding debt is denominated in foreign currencies.
 Reliance has sought shareholders approval to issue redeemable non-convertible debentures at its July 5 AGM, it said in its annual report.
 Due to the high rating at BBB+ (by S&P Global Ratings) which is two notches higher than the sovereign rating, Reliance can raise cheaper funds. Moodys has a Baa2 rating on the company, a notch above the government’s rating.
 Reliance is the only private sector company in the country that has issued perpetual bonds to foreign investors a few years back. The only other domestic entity to tap the perpetual bond market is the state-run State Bank of India.
 According to investment bankers, Reliance’s repayments from 2018 through 2020 will be its biggest for any three-year period in the past and include about USD 8.14 billion term loans, USD 3.52 billion bonds and a USD 300 million revolver loan. It also has about USD 1.65 billion in interest payments. In the June 2018 quarter its finance cost jumped more than threefold to Rs 3555 crore on an annualised basis.
 The retail-to-refining giant debt has trebled over the past five years as it invested a whopping USD 37 billion in a telecom venture and to bolster its traditional petrochemicals business which included a pet coke gasification unit and in expanding petrochemicals capacities. Telecom is still cash burning having sucked in around Rs 22,000 crore in the June quarter.
 During the recent AGM, the billionaire owner Ambani, who is the richest Asian, said his vision for the group was to become a consumer company over the next decade. Already, 31 per cent of its revenue is coming from retail and telecom business as per its June quarter numbers.
 In the June quarter, Jio, was launched just two years ago, had reported a net income of Rs 612 crore, while the market leader Airtel had plunged into a whopping Rs 980 crore loss from its domestic operations. Jio with it loads of cheap data offering, entry has crippled the once-sun-shine telecom market.
 The record net income in the June quarter was led by bumper earnings from retail business, improved profitability of telecom arm and near-doubling of earnings from petrochemical business offset lower margins from oil refining business.
 Consolidated net profit of Rs 9,459 crore was 17.9 per cent higher than Rs 8,021 crore that the oil-to-telecom conglomerate had netted and exclude a Rs 1,087 crore exceptional income from the sale of a stake in Gulf Africa Petroleum Corp. Revenue rose 56.5 per cent at Rs 1,41,699 crore thanks to the spike in oil prices."

Reliance Jio has officially started the registration process for acquiring customers for its new optical fibre-based broadband services in the country. This will be one of the largest greenfield broadband networks in the world based on optical fibre.
RJIo is likely to bundle offerings across broadband, Internet-based set-top box for television and voice telephony. RJio, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), will offer high-speed broadband under the brand JioGigaFiber, targeting 50 million homes to start with.
“Fixed-line broadband offers hundreds of megabits, even gigabits per second of data speeds. Jio is determined to move India to among the top five in fixed-line broadband,” RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani had said at the company’s 41st AGM earlier. “In countries with better developed communication infrastructure, more than 80 per cent of data consumption happens indoors through fixed-line connectivity. Optical fibre-based fixed-line broadband is the future.”"

 Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) today said it has undertaken a short shutdown of one of the units at its Jamnagar facility to ‘assure reliability and integrity’ of operations.
While the company did not specify the nature of issue at the one of the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Units (FCCU), the development is understood to have prevented the company from meeting its gasoline exports contract from the Jamnagar facility.
 In a regulatory filing, RIL said it “has taken short shutdown of one of the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Units (FCCU) at Jamnagar complex to assure reliability and integrity of operations“.
The unit is expected to restart within two weeks, it added.
“The rest of the Jamnagar complex is operating normally,” the filing said.
The company does not expect any material impact on overall operations of Jamnagar complex, it added."
177,2018-08-15,Reliance,"RJio begins registration for broadband service
 In a move that could disrupt the fixed-line internet market in the country, Reliance Jio has begun the registration process for its new optical fibre-based broadband services. Though the company has not yet disclosed the pricing, market sources expect it to be cheaper by 30-40 per cent of existing tariffs.
Currently, no major player has a national network of optical fibre. State-owned BSNL has the highest number of fixed-line telephone users, but these are mostly on copper cables, which cannot carry as much data as an optical-fibre cable. Among the private players, Airtel has optical fibre in about 90 cities. Airtel has already reworked its tariff plans in anticipation of aggressive pricing by RJio. Smaller players such as ACT Broadband have also lowered their tariffs recently.
“The fixed-line broadband market in India has so far been quite a disappointment with only few players focussing on select markets. RJio could change the game with a national footprint, just like it did with its 4G services for mobile users,” said an industry expert.
The roll-out by RJio will be one of the world’s largest greenfield broadband networks based on optical fibre. The company is likely to bundle offerings across broadband, internet-based set-top box for television and voice telephony. This could also disrupt the business model of traditional cable TV players.
RJio, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), will offer high-speed broadband under the brand JioGigaFiber, targeting 50 million homes to start with.

Debt-laden Reliance Communications (RCom) has received Rs 2,000 crore following the closure of its sales of Media Convergence Nodes (MCNs) and related infrastructure assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio).
Following the sales, 248 MCNs covering more than 5 million sq ft, used for hosting the telecom infrastructure, have been transferred to RJio, the company said in a statement.
Earlier, on August 13, sources close to the development had told BusinessLine that RCom had received the first tranche of about ₹800 crore from the sales of its assets. This was mainly for the towers, optical fibre cable network, certain spectrum and Media Convergence Nodes. 
On August 17, the Supreme Court had vacated an earlier Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) judgement passed against RCom on differential spectrum pricing on August 3, 2018. This move was expected to speed-up RJio's asset monetisation plans. 
Read the story here  
RCom and its subsidiary, Reliance Telecom, in an attempt to ward off the threat of licence and spectrum cancellation, had also re-instated bank guarantees of ₹774 crore with the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). The replenishment of the bank guarantees comes ahead of the September 10 deadline granted by the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). 
On December 28, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio) had emerged as the white knight to acquire the wireless assets of RCom, controlled by his younger sibling, Anil. RJio, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL, emerged as the successful bidder in a two-stage bidding process.
RJio had announced plans to acquire RCom’s more than 43,000 towers, 1.78-lakh route km of optical fibre cable network, 122.4 MHz of spectrum in the 800, 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz bands and 248 MCNs. These assets are expected to contribute significantly to the large-scale roll-out of RJio’s wireless, fibre-to-home and enterprise services, the Mukesh Ambani company said in a statement.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) on Thursday became the first company in India to have crossed ₹8-trillion market capitalisation after the company’s shares witnessed a record rally in 2018.
Many stocks also hit their liftetime highs on Thursday (see table).
RIL’s m-cap stood at ₹8.04-lakh crore on the BSE and the NSE as per Thursday’s closing price of ₹1,269. The stock has rallied by over 38 per cent in 2018.
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is the other behemoth on the Indian markets that has been giving RIL a tough fight for the top spot in the m-cap rankings. As on Thursday, TCS’ m-cap stood at ₹7.79-lakh crore.
 








 
 
The two per cent gain in RIL’s scrip on Thursday came after telecom regulator TRAI said that Reliance Jio continued to add subscribers at a stellar pace. Further, the market expects Reliance JioGiga Fibre, RIL’s recently-launched broadband service, to do well.
According to Trai data, RJio added 9.71 million users in June, taking its subscriber base above 215 million. It also recorded a market share rise to 18.78 per cent from 18.7 per cent a month ago.
According to HDFC, the gross investments by Jio and Bharti Airtel were similar; but the data carried on the Jio network was 3.5 times that on Airtel. But HDFC said it was negative on value to RJio lapping up the beleaguered Reliance Communications’s assets, as the company had already been utilising them at nominal value.

SBI (₹308.8)








 
SBI inched higher in the initial part of the week and then remained range-bound for the rest of the week. The stock closed 2.8 per cent higher for the week. Though the daily candle chart gives a mixed outlook, the weekly chart is bullish. A key near-term resistance is at ₹312. Inability to breach this hurdle and a subsequent fall below ₹303 — the 21-day moving average support — can drag the stock lower to ₹290 in the short term. But the downside is likely to be limited as a break below the ₹290-285 support cluster is unlikely. On the other hand, if SBI manages to break above ₹312, an up-move to ₹320 can be seen. The level of ₹320 is a key short-term resistance. A strong break and a decisive close above this hurdle will boost the momentum. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹350 or even ₹370 over the medium term. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions. Retain the stop-loss at ₹283. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹318.
 
ITC (₹319.1)








 
The uptrend in ITC remains intact and is gaining momentum. The stock surged 2.8 per cent last week and closed at a key resistance level of ₹319. A pull-back in the initial part of the week can take the stock lower to ₹315 or ₹312. But further fall below ₹312 looks unlikely at the moment. The levels of ₹312 and ₹307 are significant supports for ITC, which are likely to limit the downside in the short term. A bounce back from either ₹315 or ₹312 will increase the likelihood of the stock breaking above ₹319 decisively. Such a break can take ITC higher to ₹327 — the next crucial resistance level. As mentioned last week, a strong break above ₹327 will give the stock fresh momentum. In such a scenario, ITC will gear up for a fresh rally to ₹360 over the medium term. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Short-term traders who have taken long positions at ₹297 can hold with a stop-loss at ₹303. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹308 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹321. Book profits at ₹330.
 
 
Infosys (₹1,440)








 
Infosys surged over 4 per cent last week. The 21-day moving average is continuing to provide strong support. This support has been limiting the downside in the stock consistently since April. Immediate resistance is in the ₹1,447-1,450 region. Inability to breach ₹1,450 can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹1,400 or ₹1,390. But a strong break above ₹1,450 can take Infosys higher to ₹1,490 or ₹1,500. The region between ₹1,490 and ₹1,500 is a key resistance. A corrective fall after testing this resistance region cannot be ruled out. Long-term investors can book partial profits at ₹1,480 and keep the stop-loss for the rest of the holdings at ₹1,360. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions, retain the stop-loss at ₹1,360 and book profits at $1,485. The uptrend in Infosys will come under threat only if it declines below the 21-day moving average (₹1,393) support decisively. Such a break will trigger a fall to ₹1,350 . Further break below ₹1,350 can then drag the stock to ₹1,320 or even lower thereafter.
 
 
RIL (₹1,240.9)








 
RIL began the week on a positive note and surged about 4 per cent intra-week to record a high of ₹1,328. However, the stock lost momentum and reversed sharply lower, giving back all the gains made and closed 3 per cent lower for the week. The near-term outlook is negative. Resistance is around ₹1,280. As long as the stock remains below ₹1,280, the possibility of the stock breaking below ₹1,229 — the 21-day moving average — is high. Such a break can take RIL lower to ₹1,210 initially. A strong break below ₹1,210 will turn the outlook to negative. In such a scenario, a sharp fall to ₹1,160 or even lower levels is possible on the back of profit-booking. On the other hand, if RIL manages to reverse higher from the immediate support levels of ₹1,229 or ₹1,210, the downside pressure may ease. A bounce-back move to ₹1,260 or ₹1,270 is possible in that case. A decisive break and close above ₹1,270 will bring back the bullish momentum. It will then increase the possibility of the stock revisiting ₹1,300 and ₹1,320.
 
 
Tata Steel (₹601.6)








 
Tata Steel surged 4.6 per cent last week, recovering all the loss made in the earlier week. With this up-move, the stock has regained its strength. Support is in the ₹593-₹590 region, which is likely to limit the downside in the near term. A break below ₹590 can drag the stock lower to ₹570 or ₹565. But such a fall looks less probable as the indicators on the chart are positive . The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 100-day moving average. This is a bullish signal. Immediate resistance is at ₹619 . The possibilityof the stock breaking above this hurdle is high. Such a break can will see the current uptrend extending to ₹625 and ₹635 levels in the coming days. The region between ₹635 and ₹640 is a crucial resistance. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹640 will confirm that the downtrend that has been in place since January has reversed. As such, the price action around the ₹635-₹640 resistance region will need a close watch to get a cue on the direction of the next move."

A view of Reliance KG D6




A view of Reliance KG D6


 Reliance Industries Ltd has shut its only oil field (MA-D26) in the Krishna-Godavari basin block (KG-D6) after the reserves depleted completely, closing the door on an asset in which it had spent close to $2 billion. 
Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance on Friday announced that the MA (D26) field has ceased production, a decade after it started producing oil in September 2008.
Post cessation, activities related to safe shutdown of the field are underway, it said in a statement.
“Production from the field had been under natural decline and facing continuous challenges due to high water production and sand ingress. The field has cumulatively produced about 0.53 trillion cubic feet of gas and 31.4 million barrel of oil and condensate and had no remaining reserves,” the company said.
For Q1 FY19, the MA field contributed less than 0.1 per cent of revenue at the consolidated level for Reliance.
The statement further said: “The Dhirubhai – 26 (D26), oil, gas and condensate deep water discovery was made in 2006... It was India’s first deep water development (water depth up to 1,250 metres), with seven wells tied back through a subsea production system to a purpose built, state of the art dis-connectable turret moored Floating Production Storage and Offloading facility.”
The relevant governmental agencies had been informed of the permanent shutdown of the field, the company said in a filing to the stock exchange. 
Reliance has till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the KG basin. It is the joint operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP Plc of the UK holds a 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources Ltd of Canada holds the balance 10 per cent.
Reliance is now focussed on developing other discoveries — R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields in KG-D6 block — at a cost of ₹40,000 crore. These fields together will bring 30-35 million metric standard cubic metres per day of peak output."

 SBI (₹270) 
SBI plummeted 7 per cent last week breaking below the key support levels of ₹275 and ₹270. The stock made an intra-week low of ₹253.6 and recovered some of the loss before closing the week at ₹270. Near-term resistances are at ₹275 and ₹278. As long as the stock trades below ₹278, the outlook will remain negative and a fall to ₹256 is possible. A bounce from ₹256 can take the stock higher to ₹270 levels again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹256 and ₹278 is possible. But if SBI breaks below ₹256 decisively, it will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹245 or ₹243 in the coming weeks. Traders can go short if SBI reverses lower from the ₹275-278 resistance region. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹291 for the target of ₹245. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹270 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹260. The outlook for the stock will turn positive only on a strong rise past ₹278. In such a scenario, a relief rally to ₹287 and ₹290 is possible.










 ITC (₹303.7) 
ITC managed to stay afloat amid a strong sell-off in the broader markets last week. The stock made a smart recovery after falling about 3 per cent intra-week and closed just 1 per cent lower for the week. This reflects the inherent strength in the stock. It will come under pressure only if it declines below ₹295. The next targets are ₹290 and ₹285. But as long as ITC sustains above ₹295, the broader uptrend will remain intact. Immediate resistances are at ₹307 and ₹309. A strong break above ₹309 will take ITC higher to ₹317 or ₹321 over the short term. Further break above ₹321 will then target ₹327 — the next crucial resistance level. As being reiterated over the last few weeks, a decisive break above ₹327 will boost the momentum and trigger a fresh rally to ₹360 over the medium term. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Traders with a medium-term perspective can make use of dips to go long at ₹298 and ₹293. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹270 for the target of ₹355.










Infosys (₹706.3)
Infosys tumbled 4 per cent last week. The sharp fall over the past week has taken the stock decisively below the 21-day moving average support that has been limiting the downside over the last five months. It also indicates early signs of the uptrend, that has been in place since September 2017, getting reversed. The region between ₹718 and ₹720 is a key resistance, which has to be breached to ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take Infosys higher to ₹740 and ₹750 levels again. But as long as the stock remains below ₹721, there is a strong likelihood of it breaking below the crucial support level of ₹690 in the coming days. Such a break will confirm the trend reversal and drag Infosys to ₹660. Further break below ₹660 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹630 and ₹625. Short-term traders with high-risk appetite can go short on a bounce to ₹710 and ₹717. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹732 for the target of ₹670. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹695 when it moves to ₹685.










 RIL (₹1,216.8) 
 RIL fell, breaking below the key support level of ₹1,225 and closed about 3 per cent lower for the week. A complex head-and-shoulder reversal pattern is visible on the chart. This is a bearish pattern indicating a reversal of the current uptrend .The neckline resistance of this pattern is poised around ₹1,237. Also, another key resistance is at ₹1,253. The outlook will turn positive only if RIL manages to breach ₹1,253. This will see the stock revisiting ₹1,300 and ₹1,320 levels. But as long as the stock trades below ₹1,253, a fall to ₹1,175 or ₹1,170 cannot be ruled out in the short term. A bounce from the ₹1,175-1,170 support zone can trigger a relief rally to ₹1,200 and ₹1,220. But a break below ₹1,170 will increase the likelihood of the stock falling to ₹1,100. Traders with a medium-term perspective can wait for a bounce and go short at ₹1,225 and ₹1,245. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,265 for the target of ₹1,120. Revise the stop-loss to ₹1,205 when the stock moves down to ₹1,190.










 Tata Steel (₹615.3) 
Tata Steel seems to have remained insulated from the broader market sell-off. Though the stock tumbled about 6 per cent intraday on Friday, it managed to recover all the loss and close the week 1.5 per cent higher. Key resistance is at ₹640. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹680 and ₹700 thereafter. But if the sell-off in the broader market intensifies, the upside in this stock could be capped at ₹640. In such a scenario, Tata Steel can remain range-bound between ₹575 and ₹640 for some time. The outlook will turn negative only if Tata Steel declines below ₹575 — the 21-week moving average. Such a break can drag it to ₹550. But the price action on the chart indicates that the stock is likely to sustain above ₹575. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹560. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹620 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹635. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹635 as soon as Tata Steel moves up to ₹655."

166,2018-10-01,Reliance,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (₹265)
SBI was range-bound between ₹261 and ₹274 and closed 1.8 per cent lower for the week. The bias remains negative and any intermediate bounce in the coming days could be short-lived. A strong break below ₹261 — the 200-week moving average — can take the stock lower to ₹255. If SBI manages to bounce from ₹255, a relief rally to ₹270 is possible. But a strong break below ₹255 will increase the downside pressure. Such a break will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling to ₹245 thereafter. On the other hand, if SBI sustains above ₹261, a bounce to ₹275 is possible. The region between ₹275 and ₹277 is a key resistance zone. A strong break above ₹277 is needed to ease the downside pressure. This break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹285 over the short term. Traders with a high-risk appetite can go short on rallies at ₹273 and ₹276. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹291 for a target of ₹245. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹267 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹259.










ITC (₹296.7)
ITC shares fell 2.3 per cent and were down for the fourth consecutive week. Clusters of moving average and trendline supports are poised in the ₹290-₹280 region, which is holding well for now. ITC made a low of ₹289.5 last week and bounced from there. If the stock sustains above ₹290, an up-move to ₹305 and ₹307 is possible. A strong break above ₹307 will take the stock up to ₹317 or even ₹321 over the short term. It will confirm the end of the corrective fall that has been in place since early September. But if ITC reverses lower from the ₹305-307 resistance region, it can fall back to ₹295 and ₹290 levels again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹290 and ₹307 is possible for some time. A break below ₹290 can take ITC lower to ₹285 and ₹280. Investors can hold their long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Medium-term traders who took long positions last week on dips at ₹298 and ₹293 can hold them. Retain the stop-loss at ₹270 for a target of ₹355.










Infosys (₹727.8)
Infosys surged 3 per cent last week, recovering most of the loss made in the week earlier. The sharp bounce in the past week has triggered the stop-loss on the short positions recommended last week. The price action over the past two weeks leaves the immediate outlook unclear for the stock. Key support is at ₹690 and resistance is in between ₹740 and ₹750. Infosys can remain in a broad sideways range between ₹690 and ₹750. A breakout on either side of ₹690 or ₹750 will then decide the next move. A strong break above ₹750 can take the stock higher to ₹757 initially. A break above ₹757 will then take the stock fhigher to ₹770 thereafter. On the other hand, if the Infosys stock breaks below ₹690, it can come under selling pressure. This break will drag the stock lower to ₹660 on the back of profit-booking. It will also confirm that the uptrend since August 2017 has reversed. Further break below ₹660 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹630 and ₹625










RIL (₹1,258.2)
Contrary to expectations, RIL surged over 3 per cent last week. The short positions recommended last week have been stopped out on the strong bounce-back move witnessed last week. The head and shoulder reversal pattern mentioned last week has got negated. A key support is at ₹1,242. As long as the stock remains above this support, an up-move to ₹1,280 is possible. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,280 will boost the momentum. Such a break will then pave way for a fresh rally to ₹1,350 or even higher levels. The bullish outlook will get negated if RIL declines below ₹1,242 decisively. Such a break can drag the stock lower to ₹1,200 or ₹1,195 in the near term. Further break below ₹1,195 will then increase the likelihood of the downmove extending to ₹1,185 or ₹1,180. The level of ₹1,180 is a crucial long-term trend-line support for the stock. The uptrend that has been in place since the beginning of this year will come under threat if RIL declines below ₹1,180.










Tata Steel (₹580.35)
Tata Steel tumbled over 7 per cent last week. The stock is poised above a crucial support level of ₹575. Whether Tata Steel bounces from this support or not will determine the next move. A bounce from ₹575 will ease the downside pressure. In such a scenario, an up-move to ₹605 or ₹615 can be seen in the near term. An inability to breach ₹615 levels can drag the stock to ₹590. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹575 and ₹615 can be seen. But if Tata Steel manages to breach ₹615, it can extend its rally to ₹637 and ₹640 thereafter. On the other hand, if Tata Steel breaks below ₹575, it can fall to ₹559. Further break below ₹559 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹540 or ₹535 thereafter. Medium-term traders can retain their long positions. Keep the stop-loss at ₹560. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹605 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹613. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹615 as soon as Tata Steel goes up to ₹630."

Reliance Industries Ltd on Wednesday posted a higher consolidated profit for the July to September period, helped by a strong profit in its petrochemicals segment.
The conglomerate, whose businesses include refining, petrochemicals, retail and telecommunications, said profit rose 17.3 percent to 95.16 billion rupees.
That was slightly below the 95.67 billion rupees average of 11 analyst estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Revenue from operations rose more than 53 percent to 1.46 trillion rupees, Reliance said on Wednesday.
Profit on a standalone basis, which excludes retail and telecoms, rose 7.2 percent from the same period a year earlier to 88.59 billion rupees."

The consolidated net profit of Reliance Industries Ltd, the oil to telecom conglomerate owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, rose 17.4 per cent in the July-September quarter to ₹9,516 crore from a year ago as revenue from operations jumped 54.5 per cent to ₹1,56,291 crore.
The consolidated net profit was ₹8,109 crore on revenue of ₹1,01,169 crore in the second quarter of FY18.
Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL, posted a net profit of ₹681 crore for the quarter under review, making its fourth consecutive quarter of profits. In the comparable year-ago quarter, the operator had posted a net loss of ₹271 crore.
The company’s EBITDA rose to ₹3,573 crore, a 148 per cent jump from ₹1,443 crore posted during the same year-ago quarter. The company added 37 million new customers during the quarter, the highest since the launch of its commercial services.
However, the company’s Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), stood at ₹131.7 during the quarter.
“ARPU has come up slightly because of the massive expansion in JioPhones due to the Monsoon Hungama, as well as because we have expanded into more tier III, IV cities and rural areas. The Jio plan of ₹99 plan has been pulling in people,” Anshuman Thakur, Head of Strategy and Planning at RJio, said.
RJio’s subscriber base crossed 252.3 million, while churn stood at 0.66 per cent.
Reliance Industries, which runs the world’s biggest refining and petrochemicals complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat, said the quarterly consolidated net profit was also boosted by higher price realisations from refinery and petrochemical products.
The gross refining margins — what a refiner earns by turning a barrel of crude oil into refined products — fell to $9.5 per barrel from $12 a year ago due to higher crude prices and shut down of the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCC).
The lower refining margins dragged down the EBIT in the refining and marketing business by 19.6 per cent to ₹5,322 crore.
The crude throughput dropped to 17.7 million tonnes (mt) from 18.1 mt a year ago.
The petrochemicals business posted a 56.2 per cent rise in revenue to ₹43,745 crore from Rs 27,999 crore in the second quarter of FY18 on the back of higher volumes and price realisations.
The throughput in petrochemicals rose to 9.4 mt from 7.9 mt a year earlier.
“Our integrated refining and petrochemicals business generated strong cash flows in a period of heightened volatility in commodity and currency markets,” Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said in a statement.
Reliance said that the ₹1 cut in petrol and diesel prices effected by state-run oil marketing companies will not have an impact on its retail expansion plans.

Italian export-credit agency SACE SpA (CDP Group) has guaranteed $500 million of credit lines granted by various banks to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).
The loan, granted by HSBC (also acting as global co-ordinator and facility agent) and a pool of global banks including BNP Paribas, DZ Bank AG, First Abu Dhabi Bank and MUFG Bank, is to facilitate participation of Italian companies in suitable procurement opportunities offered by RIL, SACE said in a statement.
“Our enterprises are ready to approach the Indian market even more firmly,” said SACE Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Decio.
“The trade relationship between the two countries is growing fast, with a 9.3 per cent in 2017 and an increase of almost 16 per cent in the first seven months of 2018: the outlook is going to remain positive even for the next years,” he added.
Push Strategy
This is transaction closed by SACE under its ‘Push Strategy’ programme, which endeavours to facilitate and sustain the competitiveness of Italian exports among selected foreign buyers. After the selection of foreign counterparts with a remarkable investments plan, this approach will provide subsidized loans for Italian suppliers.
Reliance and SACE will organise meetings and business-matching events between Reliance and Italian companies in relevant businesses, especially Small and Medium Entterprises (SMEs), interested in starting business dealings with the Reliance Group.
The deal will be addressed to a broad range of enterprises, including Italian leading-sectors like fashion and luxury, banking on the RIL’s retail business footprint in India and SACE’s knowledge base of Italian suppliers, the statement added.
India is one of the 15 ""essential"" markets for Made in Italy products, and those countries contributed for € 95 billion to the total exported goods in 2017. The Italian export to India, which currently amount to 3.6 billion, is expected to grow in the next three years with rate of 6.7 per cent on annual average, according to an SACE Export Report.
This is due to the huge investments plan of RIL and ‘Make in India’, the national program aimed at making the country a global manufacturing hub. This will open up interesting opportunities for Italian exports of investment goods, particularly machinery tools, a sector involved in various industries, from automotive to food processing, from energy to telecommunications, it added.

 The government move to make auto fuels cheaper by asking state-run oil companies take a hit will not impact Reliance Industries’ retail fuel expansion plans, a top official has said.
The official also denied notions of the company going slow on fuel retailing side.
 After the fuel price deregulation, especially that of diesel in September 2014, RIL, which has licence to operate 5,000 pumps, had begun to reopen the shut pumps in a phased manner and so far it has re-commissioned only 512 of them, much slower than the rivals like Nayara Energy (formerly Essar Oil which operates over 3,500 pumps now) and Shell.
 Reliance was forced to shut down its retailing business following the sharp increase in under-recoveries following the spike in global crude prices since 2011.
 “In a broader sense, I don’t think it (the forced price reduction) is going to affect what we are planning to do in terms of our fuel retail expansion. I don’t think we are going to let this alter our strategy in terms of what we are doing,” V Srikanth, the joint group chief financial officer of the company, told reporters Wednesday evening.
 He, however, conceded that the company will have to cut the retail price due to competitive pressures.
 It can be noted that along with a reduction in the excise duty to the tune of Rs 1.5 a liter, government had early October also asked the state-run oil marketing companies which have a dominate share of the fuel retailing market to take a hit of Re 1 on every litre of diesel and petrol.
 Many BJP-ruled states followed suit with cut in VAT, to minimise the pinch of the rise in oil prices on commoners.
 Sriknath said RIL’s dependence on the oil retailing is very minimal, stating that only up to 5 per cent of its refining output of over 60 million tonne is consumed in the domestic market and therefore, the impact from an overall numbers perspective is “very small“.
 When asked if the company is going slow on retail expansion, he denied so, saying the perception may be “in the context of some” rivals but his company is moving as per its retailing plans.
 He said RIL had signed an agreement with British oil major BP on the fuel retailing front, but it has not been enforced on the ground as it may be lacking in specifics."

 It said that Reliance has made the investment in SkyTran with the aim to foster a partnership in India, where it would work closely with them to develop pilot implementations followed by implementation of its network in the country at scale. 
 Reliance would play an active role in advancing the SkyTran solution, especially in telecom, digital platforms and services, advanced materials and electric batteries.

Reliance Industries (RIL) put up a good show in the September 2018 quarter with its consolidated profit rising about 17 per cent y-o-y to ₹9,516 crore.

Overall, the company’s revenue grew nearly 55 per cent y-o-y to about ₹1,56,000 crore.
The operating profits in the petchem, telecom and retail businesses continued growing at a brisk pace, aided by higher volumes, subscriber additions and store expansion, respectively. The gross refining margin (GRM), though, fell to $9.5 a barrel from $12 a barrel in the year-ago period.

 After catapulting India to being the world’s largest mobile data consuming nation, RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani Thursday said Jio’s fibre-based broadband offering can place the country among the top three nations in fixed broadband from a low rank of 135 currently.
Jio, which stormed the telecom industry with free calls and SMS bundled with dirt cheap data in 2016, has begun rolling out its ambitious ultra-high speed fibre-based broadband services for homes and offices.
“And from day one, JioGigaFiber will offer complete fixed-mobile convergence where Indians will travel seamlessly between mobile and fixed broadband networks 4G and 5G when on the move and Wi-Fi when indoors,” he said addressing the India Mobile Congress here.
Aiming to connect every premise with highest quality network, he said the move presents an opportunity to replicate India’s success in mobile data consumption for fixed broadband as well.
“I believe India will rise from a lowly 135th rank to be among the top three nations in fixed broadband at a pace that will surprise the world,” he said."

Possibility of Reliance Jio to offer bundled plan would negatively impact DTH players.
   -  The Hindu


 Reliance Industries’ acquisition of majority stakes in multiple system operators (MSOs) Hathway Cable & Datacom and DEN Networks augurs well for all the three firms, but will have a negative impact on broadcasters and direct-to-home (DTH) players, according to India Ratings (Ind-Ra).
In a move aimed at becoming the largest player in the broadband as well as the cable TV and DTH market, Reliance Industries (RIL) earlier this month said it will buy 66 per cent stake in Den Networks for Rs 2,290 crore and 51.3 per cent in Hathway Cable for Rs 2,940 crore.
Ind-Ra said this consolidation in the MSO space is negative for broadcasters as their bargaining power to command higher subscription revenue may be impacted. It also said that possibility of Reliance Jio (RJio) to offer bundled plan, which will include both the broadband and pay cable TV markets, would negatively impact DTH players. The acquisition enables RJio to gain a significant foothold across western, central and northern India, according to the rating agency.
Hathway has a major presence in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh and RIL will also acquire a minority stake in GTPL Hathway, which has a strong presence in Gujarat and West Bengal. Den Networks has a significant presence in northern India, it explained.
The acquisition will give RIL direct access to MSOs’ vast broadband infrastructure and large pool of pay cable TV subscribers, it said, adding the company can use this last mile connectivity to accelerate Reliance Jio Infocomm’s foray into the fibre-to-the-home market. “On the other hand, the deal will resolve four big challenges facing MSOs - high leverage, large capex requirements for broadband roll-out, lack of a wide spectrum of content and competition threat from RJio,” it said.
According to India Ratings, the rationale for the deal is to shorten the time horizon for RJio’s fibre-to-the-home foray as either competing or partnering with the highly fragmented local cable operator (LCO) universe would be a time-consuming process.
The rating agency further said that RJio’s aggressive marketing could lead to an expansion in the broadband market, somewhat similar to the one that took place in the wireless mobile data market. The deal gives RJio direct access to around 6.5 million broadband households (home-pass), which represents about 36 per cent of the country’s total fixed broadband subscriber base of about 18 million, according to the agency.
It will also get access to close to 12.5 million cable TV subscribers (nearly 7 per cent of total TV households), who may not have broadband connectivity yet, it added. India Ratings believes that that RJio’s target to reach 50 million household over the next three to four years looks achievable through the acquired subscribers of MSOs, higher penetration in existing markets and possible aggressive tariffs for other geographies.
The subscriber base of 50 million household, at the current monthly broadband tariff of Rs 500-600 per household, represents a Rs 30,000-36,000 crore market for RJio, it estimated."

In a first of its kind, HSBC India and ING Bank Brussels have executed a blockchain enabled, live trade finance transaction with Reliance Industries and Tricon Energy.
The blockchain enabled Letter of Credit (LC) transaction facilitated the shipment between Reliance Industries and Tricon Energy, USA. ING Bank issued the LC for Tricon Energy and HSBC India was the advising and negotiating bank for Reliance Industries. The end-to-end transaction was executed on R3’s Corda blockchain platform.
At present, physical copies of LCs are sent to each party in the transaction by post, courier or fax. “This transaction validates the commercial and operational viability of blockchain as an alternative to conventional exchanges for paper-based documentation,” HSBC India said, adding that time and cost involved in processing paper documents are often are deterrents for exporters and delays the pace of trade.
Hitendra Dave, Head-Global Banking and Markets, HSBC India said, “The use of blockchain is a significant step towards digitising trade and enables greater transparency and enhanced security in addition to making it simpler and faster.”
Srikanth Venkatachari, Joint Chief Financial Officer, Reliance Industries said the use of blockchain offers significant potential to reduce the time involved in exchange of export documentation from the current seven to 10 days to less than a day.
“This solution is a significant improvement for any organisation involved in buying and selling goods internationally, as it truly brings together all parties onto one platform,” HSBC India further said.
R3, HSBC, ING and six other banks including Bangkok Bank, BNP Paribas, CTBC Holding, NatWest, SEB and Standard Chartered support the Corda application and plan to expand the network on an open source basis to drive adoption across the industry."
151,2018-11-07,Reliance,"5 picks for Samvat 2075
K Venkatasubramanian
After a period of continuous disruptions, with several senior management changes over the last three to four years, Infosys (₹662) is set for a reasonably smooth digital ride. With a new CEO, the focus on growth seems to have returned for Infosys.
A rapidly expanding digital services business, healthy large-sized deal wins and solid traction in key verticals are positives for the company.
At the current price, the stock trades at a reasonable 16 times its likely per share earnings for FY20. The company’s PE multiples have hovered around 18-19 times over the past three years. Despite rallying more than 40 per cent over the past one year, the shares of Infosys still appear to be attractive for investors with a two-to three-year horizon.
There is considerable valuation comfort, with underlying earnings growth likely to take an upward trajectory over the next few years, more so as the rupee remains weak against the dollar.
In the first half of FY19, Infosys’ revenues grew by 14.7 per cent to ₹39,737 crore, while net profits rose by 7.1 per cent to ₹7,721 crore. The company’s revenues have grown at a compounded annual rate of 9.8 per cent between FY15 and FY18.
As clients increasingly demand automation of normal application services and look at increasing spends on advanced technologies, Infosys upped the focus on its digital offerings significantly. The digital business accounted for 31 per cent of the company’s revenues in the September quarter, up from 25 per cent in the same period last year. In fact, revenues from digital services have been growing in double-digits even on a sequential basis for the past four to six quarters.
The financial services vertical has picked up pace in the last few quarters, while retail and manufacturing have steadily increased contribution to revenues over the past one year.
Thanks to elevated oil prices, and the resultant increase in capex spends of clients in the space, the energy and utilities vertical has rebounded well too. These segments together contribute more than 70 per cent of Infosys’ revenues, indicating broad-based growth for the company. Over the last one year, the company has added four new clients in the $100-million bucket; three in the $50-million category and as many as 19 customers in the $10-million bracket.
In fact, in the recent September quarter, the company signed $2-billion of large-deals.

Hindustan Unilever has lost 12 per cent so far from its one-year high of ₹1,808 touched in end-August 2018. While it may still look a bit pricey trading at 60 times its trailing 12-month earnings, a solid recovery in consumption, post-demonetisation and GST move, a stronghold in the rural market (40 per cent of sales) — which is growing faster than the urban segment — and a diversified product portfolio with market leadership in several categories make HUL (₹1,633) a good long-term bet. Investors can take exposure to the stock now and also accumulate on any further dips due to market volatility.
Consumption has posted a convincing comeback after derailing due to demonetisation and GST. After recording a flat (year-on-year) growth in domestic volumes in the June 2017 quarter due to the GST transition, HUL’s volumes have gained traction, growing 10-12 per cent in each of the quarters beginning October to December 2017.
Superior product mix, as well as price increases to pass on rise in input prices, have helped the company record a price/mix led growth of 4-6 per cent over the last few quarters. Profit growth in these periods has also been strong, at 14-27 per cent in each of the last four quarters. All segments of the company — be it home care, beauty and personal care or food and refreshments — have more or less been contributing equally to the strong show.
In the near to medium term, while rising interest rates and a tight liquidity situation among lenders may dampen discretionary consumption to an extent, consumer non-durables may continue to do well.
HUL, with its wide reach as well as differentiated products across price points will be a beneficiary. Going forward, increasing consumer preference for premium products as well as the company’s pricing power to pass on any cost increases will drive improvement in realisations and margins. For the next leg of growth, HUL is focusing on widening the reach of products in under-penetrated categories in hair/personal care.
Towards expanding the market for its ‘naturals’ portfolio, the company is following a three-pronged strategy of introducing natural variants in its existing brands, building a bouquet of natural products under the ‘Lever Ayush’ brand and also building specialist natural brands such as Indulekha.

The stock of Titan Company (₹871), is a good long-term buy for your portfolio. Continued growth in market share in the jewellery segment, launches across product segments and the success of its gold savings and gold exchange schemes that bring new customers, are reasons behind the stronger-than-industry-average growth.
While the last few years have been challenging for the gems and jewellery industry with new regulations and higher import duty on gold which hit consumer sentiments, Titan has managed a decent show. Between 2013-14 and 2017-18, the company recorded revenue growth of 9 per cent and net profit growth of 12 per cent (CAGR). Operating margins of the jewellery and watches segments have improved, thanks to better product mix and cost-cutting. In the jewellery segment, EBIT margins were 9-10 per cent in 2015-16; they now stand at 11-13 per cent.
Revenue growth is likely to be higher over the next five years, given the GST-led push to shift in consumer demand from the unorganised to branded jewellers,
Higher import duties, if any, may not significantly impact Titan, as its gold exchange scheme is working well. The company sources a chunk of its requirement from old gold that customers bring for exchange.
While the Q1 2018-19 performance was not good , stronger-than-expected revenue growth is expected in Q2. The company, in its Q2 preview, reported that growth in the jewellery segment was good, despite headwinds, including higher gold prices, weak consumer sentiment and fewer wedding dates. Higher sales of diamond jewellery and launch of new collections in studded gold jewellery and silver were reasons for the healthy growth. The watches segment continued to see good momentum in the quarter, led by new products across affordable, work and fashion categories.
The stock has corrected from ₹1,000 in April. At current levels, the stock discounts its estimated earnings for 2019-20 by 40 times. It was trading at 53 times, its one-year forward earnings, a year back.

The Reliance Industries (₹1,074) juggernaut seems set to roll on, with the company firing on multiple cylinders. Its financial performance has been consistently healthy with profit growth of 19 per cent in 2016-17, 20 per cent in 2017-18 and 18 per cent Y-o-Y in the half-year ended September 2018. This has been driven by the massive investments made by the company in its mainstay hydrocarbon businesses — refining and petrochemicals — and in its new-age consumer businesses – digital (RJio) and retail. Strong growth in these segments has more than offset the decline in fortunes in the oil and gas exploration business that has shrunk sharply due to declining volumes.
RIL should continue to do well in the years ahead, thanks to its deep coffers and execution capabilities that allow it to invest big, achieve massive scale, and dominate industries. A diversified presence across businesses hedges risk. The mega investment phase in its hydrocarbon segments seems to be plateauing, for now. But growth in these cyclical businesses should remain healthy with the commissioning of some new facilities in the quarters ahead and also due to regulatory benefits such as fuel specification changes by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).
Meanwhile, RIL continues to invest aggressively in the retail and digital businesses, which are likely to keep growing rapidly. This is in line with the company’s plan to grow the profits of the consumer businesses to the extent of the hydrocarbon businesses; currently, the consumer businesses contribute about a quarter of total operating profits. Addition of retail stores and telecom subscribers are likely to continue at a brisk pace. Organic growth is being supplemented through strategic acquisitions. Listing of the digital and retail businesses sometime in the future could mean significant value unlocking for RIL shareholders. Investors with a long-term perspective can buy the stock.
The RIL stock made a roaring comeback from February 2017, more than doubling until August this year. But since then, the stock has lost about 20 per cent, largely due to the ongoing market weakness. This provides an entry point for long-term investors. The stock now trades at about 16.5 times the trailing 12-month earnings, lower than the average 17 times over the past year.

Amid the persisting challenges in the banking sector, HDFC Bank (₹1,947) has managed to put up a good show over the past few years, even as its peers have been weighed down by asset quality issues.
Strong loan growth, steady net interest margin and a stable asset quality have kept the private lender’s earnings in good stead.
HDFC Bank, the largest private bank, has been steadily growing its loan book by about 20-25 per cent (year-on-year) on an average over the last seven to eight quarters. It has been gaining market share, as public sector banks continue to consolidate their loan books. HDFC Bank has also retained its top slot within the private bank space over the past three years.
At the current price, the stock trades at about 3.1 times its one-year forward book value, lower than its three-year average of 3.4 times.
This offers long-term investors a good opportunity to buy the stock at the current levels, given that the bank’s earnings are likely to grow by 18-20 per cent over the next two years. The bank’s recent September quarter performance has also been noteworthy.
It delivered 24 per cent Y-o-Y growth in domestic loans in the September quarter, led by good traction in both retail and corporate loans. Notably, the pace of growth in the bank’s core net interest income that had moderated in the past two quarters, has witnessed a pick up in the latest September quarter.
From 17.7 per cent Y-o-Y growth in the March quarter, net interest income grew by a slower 15.4 per cent in the June quarter.
However, in the latest September quarter, HDFC Bank’s net interest income grew by a higher 20.6 per cent. Overall, the bank’s net profit for the quarter has grown by 20.6 per cent Y-o-Y, a healthy performance, given the ongoing challenges within the sector.
HDFC Bank’s GNPAs that had been hovering around the 1 per cent mark in the past, has inched up slightly over the past one year. In the latest September quarter, the bank’s GNPA stood at 1.33 per cent of loans."
149,2018-11-09,Reliance,"RIL raises Rs 3,000 cr via NCDs
Reliance Industries has raised Rs 3,000 crore through a privately placed debenture issue. The unsecured, non-convertible redeemable debentures offered 8.95 per cent return with a 10-year maturity, the company said in a regulatory filing.
The notes “shall be redeemed at par at the end of 10 years from the date of allotment -- November 9, 2028,” it said.
RIL, which had invested more than $30 billion over the past five years across energy, petrochemicals, retail, and telecom verticals, did not say where it will use the proceeds of the issue. Last month, it had picked up controlling stake in cable tv and broadband service providers, Hathway Cable & Datacom, and DEN Networks."

 Dozens of chartered planes carrying celebrities, including former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton, flew into a sleepy airport in western India for the lavish pre-wedding festivities for the daughter of India's richest man.
Isha Ambani, 27, daughter of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, will marry Anand Piramal, 33, in the financial capital of Mumbai next Wednesday, but the celebrations began this weekend in the desert city of Udaipur, with feasts, singing and dancing, and other pre-wedding rituals.
Security was beefed up as the high-profile guests started arriving at Udaipur's airport, said a source at the scene, who asked not to be identified. Outside, they were awaited by luxury sedans driven by chauffers wearing white uniforms and colourful Rajasthani turbans.
The Clintons and the Ambanis have an association that goes back more than 18 years and have met several times both in India and abroad, according to Indian media reports. Many other top industrialists, politicians, sports and Bollywood stars descended in Udaipur on Saturday to join what has been dubbed locally “the big, fat Indian wedding.”
Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and newly-weds, actress Priyanka Chopra and singer Nick Jonas were among the guests joining the bash. Former head of advertising giant WPP, Martin Sorrell, BP Group CEO Bob Dudley, Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington, 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch and Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih are also invited.
Guests for the celebrations, which will bring together two of India's most influential families, have access to an app mapping out the activities, which include a private concert by Beyonce."
141,2018-12-12,Reliance,"Reliance to boost capacity of SEZ refinery in Jamnagar by 5.8 mt 
Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd is seeking to expand the installed capacity of its export-oriented oil refinery in the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) at Jamnagar, Gujarat by 8.5 per cent or 5.8 million tonnes (mt).
In 1998, Reliance built its first refinery at Jamnagar with an installed capacity of 660,000 bpd or 33 mt. This refinery sells most of its petroleum products in the local market. When the SEZ plant was added in 2008, the Jamnagar complex became the world’s largest oil processing hub. Most of the products from the SEZ plant are sold overseas.
The SEZ refinery currently has the capacity to process 35.2 mt of crude. The proposal to expand its installed capacity to 41 mt will be discussed by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change’s Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) on December 19, according to documents filed with the EAC.
The planned expansion will increase the installed capacity of the Jamnagar refinery complex to 74 mt. However, the details of the expansion including the investment involved were not available.
The Jamnagar refinery processed 69.8 mt of crude in FY18, exceeding its installed capacity of 68.2 mt. Higher refinery utilisation helped cater to growing demand for transportation fuels.
India has emerged as a major refiner, having the fourth largest refining capacity in the world following the US, China and Russia. With 23 refineries having a combined capacity of 247.6 mt, India not only serves its domestic demand of 195.7 mt (2017-18), but also supplies petroleum products to other Asian countries.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the demand for petroleum products is expected to more than double to 458 million tonnes by 2040.
Indian refiners are adding more capacity to meet the growing demand from India, the world’s fastest growing major oil consuming country. These include a planned 60 mt greenfield refinery at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra by a consortium of Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Saudi Aramco), Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation.
Russian oil major Rosneft PJSC-backed Nayara Energy Limited, which runs India’s second largest single site refinery at Vadinar, Gujarat with a capacity of 20 mt, has applied for environment clearance to boost capacity to 46 mt.
Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd (BORL) which runs a 7.8 mt refinery at Bina in Madhya Pradesh, is working on a blue print to double the capacity to 15.5 mt. BORL is an equal joint venture between India’s state-run oil refiner Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Oman Oil Company.
State-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corporation is building a 9 mt greenfield refinery at Barmer in Rajasthan."

SBI (₹289.1)
SBI opened the week on a negative note with a wide gap-down of ₹14 at ₹261.1. The stop-loss on the long positions recommended was hit. However, the stock managed to claw-back from the low of ₹261.1, recovering all the loss and closed on a positive note. The stock was up 5 per cent for the week. A crucial near-term resistance is at ₹294. Whether SBI breaks above this hurdle or not will determine the direction of the next move. Inability to breach ₹294 can pull the stock lower to ₹278 or ₹274 in the near term. A further break below ₹274 will then target ₹269. On the other hand, if SBI breaks above ₹294 decisively, it can gain strength. Such a break can take the stock initially higher to ₹310 and ₹312. A strong break above ₹312 will then pave way for the next target of ₹322 thereafter. Short-term traders can go long on a break above ₹294. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹282 for the target of ₹318. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹307.










ITC (₹275.6)
ITC broke below the key support level of ₹271 in the initial part of the week. However, negative sentiment was short-lived as ITC reversed sharply higher, recovering all the loss from the low of ₹268.2. Though the daily candles on the chart give mixed signals, the weekly candles are relatively positive. Support is in the ₹272-271 region. As long as the stock remains above this support zone, there is a strong likelihood of it breaking above the near-term resistance level of ₹279. Such a break can take ITC initially higher to ₹285 or ₹287. A further break above ₹287 will increase the possibility of the stock extending its up-move towards the 21-week moving average resistance level of ₹293. The bullish outlook will get negated if ITC breaks and closes decisively below ₹271. The stock can, thus, fall initially to ₹267. A bounce from ₹267 can take the stock higher to ₹271 and ₹272 again. But a strong break below ₹267 will increase the downside pressure. This will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹262 thereafter.










Infosys (₹705.6)
Infosys is retaining its strength. The stock was up for the third consecutive week. It surged 3.6 per cent, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹687 and closed on a strong note. The outlook is bullish. Immediate support is at ₹698 and the next key support is at ₹688. Also, there is an inverted head and shoulder pattern visible on the daily chart. This is a bullish reversal pattern. The neckline support of this pattern is at ₹684. Intermediate dips in the near term are likely to find fresh buyers coming into the market. An up-move to ₹721 is likely in the near term. Inability to breach ₹721 can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹700. But an eventual break above ₹721 will boost the momentum. This will increase the likelihood of the stock revisiting ₹740 and ₹750 levels. Traders can go long at current levels and also accumulate on dips at the levels of ₹701 and ₹693. Keep the stop-loss at ₹675 for the target of ₹760. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹715 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹730.










RIL (₹1,111.7)
RIL fell for the second consecutive week. The stock was down about 2 per cent last week. However, the sharp bounce from the week’s low of ₹1,055 gives a breather for the stock. The 200-day as well as a trend-line, both poised around ₹1,055, has provided strong support for RIL. The near-term outlook is mixed. Resistance is at ₹1,128. If RIL manages to sustain above ₹1,100 and decisively break above ₹1,128, the near-term outlook will turn positive. An up-move to ₹1,160 is possible. A further break above ₹1,160 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹1,185. On the other hand, if RIL declines below ₹1,100, it can fall to ₹1,055 again. A further break below ₹1,055 will increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹1,030 or even ₹1,010 thereafter. Broadly, RIL has been range-bound between ₹1,050 and ₹1,200 since October. A decisive breakout on either side of ₹1,050 or ₹1,200 will determine the direction of the next move. Traders can stay out of this stock until a clear trend emerges.










Tata Steel (₹513.4)
Tata Steel snapped its three-week fall. The stock reversed higher from the low of ₹486.9, recovering all the loss and closed 1.1 per cent higher for the week. Though the stock has bounced back, the price action seems to be lacking strength. This leaves the bias negative and keeps the broader downtrend intact. Cluster of resistance is poised in the ₹530-540 region, which can cap the upside in the near term. If Tata Steel manages to breach ₹540, an upmove to ₹565 and ₹570 is possible. But while below ₹540, a fall again to ₹485 and ₹480 cannot be ruled out. A bounce from around ₹480 again can keep the stock range-bound between ₹480 and ₹540. But a strong break below ₹480 can drag Tata Steel lower to ₹460. The level of ₹460 is a crucial long-term trend support, which may have the potential to halt the downtrend that has been in place since the beginning of this year. As such, the price action around ₹460 will need a close watch to get a cue on the next move."

SBI (₹294.4) 
SBI is managing to sustain higher. The stock dipped to an intraweek low of ₹287.2, but reversed immediately higher from there. The resistance at ₹301 is likely to be tested in the near term. Inability to breach ₹301 can pull SBI lower to ₹290 and ₹287 again. But the price action on the chart leaves the bias bullish for the stock to break above ₹301 and rally towards ₹310 and ₹312. A further break above ₹312 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹320 and ₹322. The region around ₹322 is a crucial long-term resistance. The price action around this hurdle will need a close watch to get a cue on the next direction of move. Supports are at ₹287 and ₹284.5. The near-term view will turn negative only if SBI declines below ₹284.5. The next target is ₹280. But such a fall looks less probable at the moment. Traders who have taken long positions above ₹294 can hold with a stop-loss at ₹282. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock goes up to ₹307. Book profits at ₹318. 










ITC (₹281.9) 
ITC inched higher for the third consecutive week. The stock was up 2 per cent last week. Immediate resistance is at ₹284 and support at ₹278. The stock is likely to breach ₹284 and test ₹287 in the near term. A break above ₹287 can then target ₹290. The levels of ₹287 and ₹290 are key resistances, and whether ITC breaches these hurdles or not will decide the direction of the next move. A decisive break above ₹290 will boost the momentum and take ITC higher to ₹296 and ₹300 thereafter. Such an up-move will also confirm the end of the downtrend that has been in place since September. On the other hand, if ITC reverses lower from ₹287 or ₹290, it can fall to ₹280 and ₹275 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹275 and ₹290.










Infosys (₹657.6) 
Infosys fell in the initial part of the week but managed to claw-back from the low of ₹637.7 and closed 2 per cent higher. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 200-day moving average support at ₹649 is holding well . Key resistances are at ₹663, ₹666 and ₹671. As long as Infosys trades above ₹649, a test of the above-mentioned hurdles is possible in the near term. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹671 will turn the outlook to positive and take the stock higher to ₹682 and ₹686. A further break above ₹686 will then pave way for the next short-term targets of ₹700 and ₹710. The stock will come under pressure if it breaks decisively below the 200-day moving average. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹630. A break below ₹630 can then drag it to ₹600 and ₹590. Traders who took short positions last week at ₹660 should remain cautious. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹675. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹655 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹645. Book profits at ₹630. 










RIL (₹1,125.8) 
RIL reversed sharply higher last week after making a low of ₹1,066.5 and closed 2 per cent higher. The upward reversal has happened from the 200-day moving average, which has been providing strong support for the stock since October. The near-term view is positive and RIL can move up to ₹1,180 and ₹1,185. The stock has been range-bound between ₹1,050 and ₹1,185 for more than three months now. Its ability to bounce higher every time it dips to the 200-day moving average keeps the bias positive . The possibility is also high of the stock breaking above ₹1,185. Such a break will take RIL initially higher to ₹1,205 or ₹1,210. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,210 will then boost the momentum and pave way for the next target of ₹1,275. Medium-term investors can go long at current levels and accumulate on dips at ₹1,095 and ₹1,070. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,025. The outlook will turn negative only if RIL closes decisively below the 200-day moving average support. In such a scenario, the stock can fall to ₹1,000 and ₹990.










Tata Steel (₹513.7) 
After inching higher for two weeks, Tata Steel reversed last week. Trading in the stock was subdued. It was stuck in a narrow range between ₹505 and ₹521 last week. The 21-day moving average at ₹519 is restricting the upside. A strong break and a decisive close above this hurdle is needed to ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹533 or even ₹539 over the short term. Inability to breach ₹533 or ₹539 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹520 and ₹518. But a strong break above ₹539 will boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹546 and ₹550. On the other hand, if Tata Steel remains below the 21-day moving average resistance, a fall to ₹505 or ₹500 is possible in the near term. A break below ₹500 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹480. A bounce from ₹480 can keep the stock range-bound between ₹480 and ₹530 for some time. But a decisive break below ₹480 can then drag Tata Steel lower to the crucial support level of ₹460."
138,2018-12-31,Reliance,"RCom, Reliance Jio extend validity of asset sale pact to June 28 


istock.com/AlexRaths AlexRaths




istock.com/AlexRaths AlexRaths


Debt-laden Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) has extended the validity of its earlier signed deal with Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio) to June 28, 2019. “The transactions are to be consummated subject to various approvals that are presently in progress,” RCom said in a regulatory filing.
RJio, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries (RIL) also confirmed the same in a separate statement to the BSE.
The deal between RCom and RJio – signed on December 28, 2017 - is awaiting regulatory approvals, including a spectrum trading deal from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led RJio announced plans to acquire the wireless assets of RCom, controlled by his younger sibling, Anil.
Earlier on December 18 this year, RJio had asked DoT to approve the spectrum trading deal only after ensuring RCom paid up all its liabilities as per the licence conditions.
Later on December 20, RCom said that it was “committed” to settling all dues and disputes, even as it awaits DoT’s consent for spectrum sales. The Anil Ambani-led company said it had complied with all spectrum trading guidelines.
RJio, which had emerged as the successful bidder in a two-stage bidding process, signed an agreement to RCom’s more than 43,000 towers, 1.78-lakh route km of optical fibre cable network, 122.4 MHz of spectrum in the 800, 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz bands and 248 Media Convergence Nodes.
These assets were expected to contribute significantly to the large-scale roll-out of RJio’s wireless, fibre-to-home and enterprise services.
On Monday, RIL shares closed down 0.42 per cent at Rs 1,121.05, while that of RCom ended down at 2.04 per cent.

SBI (297.5) 
SBI has been struggling over the last few weeks for strong follow-through buyers to take it decisively above ₹300. But, at the same time, the stock is also not attracting fresh sellers to drag it sharply lower. This leaves the bias bullish. The 21-day moving average at ₹289 is a key near-term support. As long as SBI trades above this support, the possibility of the stock breaching the ₹300-₹302 support zone is high. Such a break will take the stock higher initially to ₹310 and ₹312. A further break above ₹312 can then target ₹320 and ₹322. As mentioned last week, a crucial long-term resistance is poised around ₹322. As such, the price action around it will need a close watch to get a cue on the direction of the next move. The near-term view will turn negative if SBI declines decisively below ₹289. In such a scenario, a fall to ₹282 or ₹280 is possible. Traders who have taken long positions above ₹294 can hold it with a stop-loss at ₹282. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹307. Book profits at ₹318.










ITC (₹280.7) 
ITC was stuck in a sideways range between ₹277 and ₹284 last week. The resistance at ₹284 is continuing to cap the upside for the third consecutive week. A strong break above this hurdle is needed to ease the downside pressure for the stock. Such a break can take ITC higher initially to ₹287 and ₹290 — the next key resistance levels. If ITC manages to breach ₹290 decisively, the stock can gain momentum and target ₹296 and ₹300. But a pull-back from ₹290 can drag the stock lower to ₹285 and ₹280 again. On the other hand, if ITC continues to trade below ₹284 in the coming days and declines below ₹277, it can test ₹275 and ₹274. The outlook will turn completely negative if the stock breaks decisively below ₹274. In such a scenario, there is a strong likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹270 and ₹268. But the price action on the chart makes the bias bullish for ITC to break above ₹284. Medium-term investors who have taken long positions at ₹282 and ₹278 can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹262.










Infosys (₹660.7) 
Infosys seems to be lacking strength. The stock inched up in the initial part of the week but failed to sustain higher. Infosys made an intraweek high of ₹677 and came-off sharply giving up almost all the gains made during the week. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 200-day moving average at ₹650 is a crucial support to watch out for. If Infosys manages to sustain above this support, a bounce to ₹675 and ₹680 is possible in the near term. A strong break above ₹680 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹700 and ₹710 levels thereafter. The region around ₹710 is a significant resistance. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹710 is needed to turn the outlook completely to positive. Such a break will then pave way for the next targets of ₹750 and ₹760. On the other hand, if Infosys declines decisively below the 200-day moving average, it can come under renewed pressure. In such a scenario, a fall initially to ₹630 can be seen. A further break below ₹630 can then drag the stock lower to ₹600 and ₹590. 










RIL (₹1,099)
RIL has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹1,050 and ₹1,150 over the last one month. Within this range, the stock fell 2 per cent in the past week. A breakout on either side of ₹1,050 or ₹1,150 will determine the direction of the next move. The 200-day moving average support is at ₹1,069. A decisive close below this support will increase the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,050. A break below ₹1,050 will take RIL initially lower to ₹1,020. A further break below ₹1,020 will then increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹900 or even ₹980 thereafter. On the other hand, if RIL sustains above the 200-day moving average support, the bias will remain positive. A strong break above ₹1,150 will ease the downside pressure. The next targets are ₹1,190 and ₹1,200. A strong break above ₹1,200 will turn the outlook to positive and will pave way for a revisit of ₹1,250 and ₹1,300. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions taken at ₹1,125 and ₹1,095. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,025. 










Tata Steel (₹487.7) 
Tata Steel tumbled 5 per cent last week. The sharp fall last week indicates that the long-term downtrend in the stock is intact. Though there is a support near current levels at ₹480, Tata Steel looks vulnerable to break below it. A break below ₹480 can take the stock lower to ₹460. A further break below ₹460 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹430. Cluster of significant supports are poised in the broad ₹460-₹430 region. There is a strong likelihood of the current downtrend halting in this support zone. A strong upward reversal from this ₹460-₹430 support zone could be a good buying opportunity for investors with a long-term perspective. As such, the price action around the ₹460-₹430 support zone will need a close watch to get a cue on the next trend. On the other hand, if Tata Steel sustains above ₹480, a bounce to ₹500 or ₹510 can be seen. But the upside is likely to be capped as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels."

Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries
   -  Reuters


 Richest Indian Mukesh Ambani has featured in the top Global Thinkers 2019 ranking of the prestigious Foreign Policy publication alongside the likes of Alibaba founder Jack Ma, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and IMF head Christine Lagarde.
 The publication on its website released a few of the names in the 2019 list of 100 Thinkers, saying the full list would be released on January 22.
 “With a fortune of $ 44.3 billion, Mukesh Ambani displaced Jack Ma in 2018 as Asia’s richest man. Ambani’s fortune comes from his holdings in the oil, gas, and retail sectors, but he’s likely to make his biggest impact on India through his new telecom venture Jio,” it said. Ambani is Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries Ltd. Reliance Jio is a subsidiary of RIL.
 “Offering cellular data and voice free for the first six months after Jio’s launch, he got more than 100 million to sign up -- accelerating a smartphone internet revolution in the world’s largest democracy,” it said. “The next stage of Ambani’s plan is to use the digital airwaves to sell content and lifestyle products, eventually competing with Google and Facebook.” Foreign Policy said 2019 marks the 10th anniversary of its Global Thinkers listing and it has decided to split the list into 10 categories of 10.
 “The first group comprises thinkers who have had an enormous impact on the world in the past decade. The other groups are for people who have been influential in the past year: thinkers and doers 40 and under, as well as those in defence and security, energy and climate, technology, economics and business, science and health, and activism and the arts,” it said adding the full list of 100 will be released on January 22 - the day its Global Thinkers special edition magazine goes live.
 Ambani is listed in the Top 10 Technology Thinkers list. In the Top 10 of the Last 10 Years listing, Jack Ma, who founded the e-commerce company Alibaba in 1999 to enable businesses to reach once inaccessible consumers, as also International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde is listed."

Mukesh Ambani could shop until his rivals drop. After upending India’s telecom industry by building an upstart data network into the world's largest, the energy billionaire wants to redefine how Indians buy things. It pits him against Jeff Bezos e-commerce giant Amazon, Walmart’s Flipkart - newly acquired at a valuation of $21 billion - and Chinese behemoth Alibaba. Past success and the deep pockets provided by a cash-cow oil business make Ambani a serious competitor.
At this month's annual general meeting of his $95 billion Reliance Industries in Mumbai, Ambani set a target of generating nearly half the group's EBITDA from consumer businesses within a decade, up from around 13 per cent today. Held in an auditorium packed with employees and shareholders, these days his yearly presentation has a flavour of former Apple boss Steve Jobs' iPhone launch appearances.
Ambani only has to look at the list of the world's most valuable companies to know that consumer-facing technology has overtaken Big Oil. And his Jio mobile network shows he's not afraid to wade into others' territory with a new model. Reliance has spent over $30 billion rolling out the giant 4G network across India. In almost two years since its launch, Jio has won over 215 million subscribers. A brutal price war has brought rivals to their knees, including Reliance Communications , run by Ambani's younger brother Anil Ambani. Even global giant Vodafone was forced last year to agree to merge its Indian business with a competitor.
Ambani now envisions rolling out broadband fibre and taking a digital, immersive shopping experience to Indians on their mobiles or large screens in their smart homes using, in his words, augmented reality, holographic technology, and VR devices. He wants to create a so-called hybrid online-to-offline platform that connects customers to the nation's small shopkeepers. Reliance is already dabbling in Jio-branded payments and cloud services, and it is a big owner of news, movies and music. The motto is to connect everyone and everything, everywhere.
The challenge is daunting. Amazon says it already offers 170 million products and serves every one of India Post's many thousand numbered delivery districts, including mountainous villages. Bezos wants to do more, and he has committed at least $5.5 billion to the country. Meanwhile, Flipkart - the creation of two Indian Amazon alumni - now has US grocery leader Walmart's muscle behind it. And Alibaba and Masayoshi Sons SoftBank have thrown money behind the smaller Paytm Mall. Even among these strong rivals, history elsewhere suggests the various models will probably converge and consolidate over time.
Yet, the opportunity is also huge. There is great demand for convenience given the infrastructure challenges that make buying everyday items a struggle. India’s population, currently 1.3 billion, will overtake that of China by around 2024, according to the United Nations. The IMF forecasts economic growth at between 7 percent and 8 percent in the coming years. And even now, e-commerce accounts for barely 3 percent of the $860 billion retail market, excluding travel and tourism, Madhur Singhal of Praxis Global Alliance reckons.
Some investors hope India will be the next China, spawning local versions of Jack Mas $500 billion Alibaba. Maybe so, but not yet. India might only lag the People's Republic by about four to five years in terms of smartphone penetration, according to Counterpoint Research. That’s important because local consumers primarily use mobile devices for shopping. On an average per-capita income basis, though, India could be as far as 17 years behind, according to Morgan Stanley estimates.
Ambani has some potential advantages as Reliance steps into this landscape. With a mobile operator, Jio-branded handsets, and a fast-growing retail network comprised of 7,500 stores selling everything from digital goods to fashion and groceries, he can already collect useful data on consumer habits. That could give him an edge.
Also in the tycoon's favour is his nationality. India has proved receptive to foreign capital. Politicians in New Delhi have so far ignored protectionist complaints about the nascent and now largely foreign-led e-commerce industry. But Chinese influence, especially, is a potential source of angst, given regular border skirmishes. And if India really is the next China, perhaps local companies will end up dominating e-commerce and adjacent markets.
Ambani’s biggest challenge may be to understand the mindset of India's burgeoning cohort of consumers. Reliance was founded as a textile company and its Vimal brand was one of the first major retail chains in the country. Until Jio, though, the bulk of the groups recent focus has been on refining and petrochemicals. Plenty of Silicon Valley types would see that as a disqualifying old-school background.
But the Reliance boss, personally worth more than $40 billion according to Forbes, has at least one aspect of the tech model down: hooking users with free stuff. Part of Jio’s enormous success is down to low pricing, and Ambani initially gave the service away. Local media are already speculating that he will do the same with broadband.
Market share is important in consumer-facing technology, and achieving it has a lot to do with rapid expansion. That often means heavy investment without regard to revenue. Huge amounts of cash handed to a No. 2 or 3 player can leave a market leader in the dust. Ambani appears to have the stomach for the fight and, like Amazon's shareholders, those at Reliance are proving exceptionally patient. Bezos, for one, needs to watch his back.

133,2019-01-19,Reliance,"Reliance’s foray into e-comm will reduce digital colonisation: Pai
 Investment guru and former Infosys CFO, T. V. Mohandas Pai, on Saturday said Reliance’s foray into the e-commerce space would allay fears of digital colonisation and dramatically lower costs, immensely benefiting consumers.
“One thing is certain that consumers and India will be a winner, and in online retail, the fear of becoming a digital colony will recede with the entry of a formidable Indian entity, Reliance,” he told PTI in an interview here.
Reliance seems to be creating a next generation retail network which has the potential to radically change the dynamics of retail in a fast growing economy, Pai said, adding that “it would dramatically lower costs, reduce inefficiencies in supply chain, reduce waste and deliver better. This will immensely benefit consumers.” 
Pai’s comments come in the wake of Ambani’s plans to create an online-to-offline platform at the Vibrant Gujarat Summit and urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take steps to end increasing “data colonisation” by global corporations.
Ambani, who is Chairman of Reliance Industries, drew parallels between Mahatma Gandhi’s movement against political colonisation and the call for a revolution against data colonisation and pressed for control and ownership of India’s data by its own people, not by corporates.
Reliance is truly a formidable competitor as it has capital, technology, networks, physical retail presence, a long-term vision and the passion to win, he said.
Reliance’s next generation retail network is powered by a robust fibre network, with an efficient supply-chain, giving consumers an online-offline experience of their choice.
Pai noted that exciting times were ahead with the entry of Reliance into the e-commerce space as the existing online players have grown on customer discounts, blowing up nearly Rs 50,000 crore in capital through discounts and infrastructure.
“Jio has created a national network of mom and pop stores and other retail, along with their own network on a broadband fibre network.
With their existing retail network they will be a formidable competitor to the big online retail players. For retail to succeed, the supply chain and distribution are critical,” he said.
Online retailers create distribution capability through their tech portals, which have a global reach, but the back-end supply chain remains the same as goods need to be delivered, the former Infosys CFO said.
“The business is now moving to an online-offline model as consumers still love the physical shopping experience in many categories,” he added."

155,2019-01-23,Reliance,"Reliance to play ball with state-run refiners on ₹1 cut in fuel prices


oil




oil


Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd will “match” the recent ₹1 per litre rate cut in petrol and diesel effected by state-run oil marketing companies, to prop-up its share in the local market.
This is unlike its stand a few years ago when it shut fuel stations, unable to match and compete with the subsidised rates charged by Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, which between themselves hold as much as 90 per cent share of fuel retailing in the domestic market. In October 2014, the government deregulated diesel prices (petrol prices were freed in 2010), enabling private refiners such as Reliance to restart pumps and claw its way back into the fuel retail business.
The rate cut effected from October 4 was to check rising fuel pump rates that soared in the backdrop of a rally in global crude prices, raising concerns that it will again create a disparity in pricing of fuels between state-owned and private refiners and clip retail expansion plans in the world’s fastest growing energy market.
“Our dependence on retail market for petroleum is obviously small. Around five per cent of our total refinery output goes eventually into the domestic retail market,” said V Srikanth, joint chief financial officer at RIL. The rest are exported.
“Does it (the ₹1 cut) have an impact on us. Of course, you cannot have two petrol pumps, one selling a rupee below the other; so, you have to effectively match it. But, in a broader sense, I don’t think it affects what we are trying to do on the retail expansion. I don’t think we are going to let this alter broadly our strategy in terms of what we are doing on the retail side,” Srikanth said after the firm announced its second quarter results last week. Assessments on (retail) expansion differ with the “times”, he said, adding it would be difficult to conclude an assessment based on “just one occasion and dramatically alter the course on what we have to do on petroleum expansion”.
Srikanth said its plans to open co-branded retail fuel stations along with BP Plc – its partner in the KG basin oil block — was yet to take concrete shape.
“We have signed a memorandum of understanding with BP, but we haven’t progressed beyond that, there is no definitive agreement. But overall, we will continue to expand our retail foot print,” he said, adding that the recent marketing changes would not change the company’s outlook.
“At this point in time, there is no change in time lines and how fast we will grow. I don’t think it is on slow track,” he added.
Currently, Reliance runs 1,345 retail fuel outlets — including 10 re-commissioned during the July to September quarter — of which 512 are owned by the company. India has 57,312 petrol stations.
During the second quarter of FY19, India’s oil product demand grew 2.7 per cent from an year ago.
The growth in petrol was 6.6 per cent while diesel grew 2.8 per cent.
Reliance said its petrol sales in the domestic market grew by 21 per cent and diesel by 8 per cent in the second quarter from a year ago on the back of strong demand for transportation fuel.
The owner of the world’s biggest refining and petrochemicals complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat said it was looking at “strategic initiatives and technology for continuous volume growth”.
These include “customised ‘state-specific’ strategies for improving market share” and roll-out of an automated price engine — a major initiative on dynamic strategic pricing."

 Reliance Industries and its group companies have announced an open offer to acquire an additional 26 per cent stake in Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd.

 In October last year, Reliance Industries had announced it will buy majority stakes in Den Networks Ltd and Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd for Rs 5,230 crore. In DEN, Reliance is making a primary investment of Rs 2,045 crore through a preferential issue and secondary purchase of Rs 245 crore from existing promoters. In Hathway, RIL is making primary investment of Rs 2,940 crore through a preferential issue. RIL had Tuesday said it has received CCI nod for the two buys."

128,2019-01-27,Reliance,"From Licence Raj to digital disruptions
 
When Reliance Industries founder Dhirubhai Ambani famously said in a 1985 interview that he is “willing to salaam anyone” in the context of managing the environment (read, the government of India), he was reflecting on the conditions that existed for the industry during the License Raj. As many as 80 approvals were required from various government departments to start a business. Once an entrepreneur managed to do it, the government decided the technology he will use, the quantity he will produce, where he will sell and how much he can price his product.
The industry felt stifled and it had no incentive to be productive (after all, they priced on a cost-plus model) or develop products by investing in R&D or modern technology (with government allowing only a modest foreign exchange outgo, all that the industry could buy was discarded technology). With no competition, there was little focus on quality or customer. To make matters worse, the private sector was seen with suspicion while public sector units were encouraged.
“The policy overburden meant growth was marginal and exports — weighed down by an artificially propped-up rupee — were non-existent,” recalls R Seshasayee, former Managing Director of Ashok Leyland and presently Chairman, IndusInd Bank.
On July 24, 1991, the Licence Raj ended, and almost four decades later, the Indian industry has come a long way. Made-in-India is no more a bad word, and exports have grown consistently. The country has come to be recognised globally for lean manufacturing and jugaad (low-cost innovations) which has since given birth to reverse innovation — products and services designed for emerging markets finding use in developed economies. India is today home to many Fortune 500 companies, satiating the country’s strong domestic consumption as well as meeting their regional export needs.
But this transformation was not easy. The first steps were taken late in 1983, eight years before India opened up, when Maruti started manufacturing cars in India. “We wanted to make cars with the same quality and cost as the Japanese, and Suzuki agreed to help, provided we listened to them,” says RC Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki.
That ushered in the Japanese system of manufacturing, including TPM/TQM, in India. It did not stop with Maruti, but spread across its supply chain. “But for this the auto sector would not have been ready to face competition post-1991,” he adds. Today, Indian auto components and cars are exported worldwide, and accounts for a large share of the country’s exports.
Nevertheless, liberalisation was painful. “We had to fight across three frontiers,” says Seshasayee. On the labour front, the hitherto virulent and confrontational trade unions had to be roped in as partners to improve productivity. Massive capital deployment had to be made to modernise plants and equipment. And finally, the industry had to look for modern technology, which came either through partnerships or collaborations. “Those who managed to do this survived, and others went down,” he adds.
In fact, the transformation post-liberalisation can be classified into four phases. In the first phase, between 1991 and 2000, manufacturing exploded with the entry of multinational companies. Some of them brought their suppliers with them. Indian companies, for their part, embraced quality and modern manufacturing practices to become competitive.
The second phase (2000-2008) saw Indian players — having fixed their shortcomings and fended off competition — expanding in a big way. The global financial crisis and its ripple effect in India ended phase-II and triggered the next phase (2009-15) — one of consolidation. Indian companies cut costs and de-leveraged their balance sheets.
The phase-IV, in play now, is one of digital transformation. How companies use digital tools in manufacturing as well as other aspects of business will determine who the winner or loser is. This has not been easy. “It is taking time for companies to redefine their process and standardise operations, which is critical for digital transformation. A cultural change is needed to work in a digital environment,” says Vinod Ramachandran, Head, Industrial Manufacturing and Automotive, KPMG India. He added: “Companies have underestimated their digital readiness.”
The industry has a few more years to get the people, processes, supply chains and the extended supply chains digital-ready as the emergence of 5G network will remove bandwidth constraints, and factories will get automated. “Many old ways of working will completely change,” says Ramachandran.
Seshasayee sees this as an opportunity to embrace Industry 4.0. Heavily automated plants may create lower jobs, but will throw open a lot of service opportunities. “We missed the manufacturing bus (in its traditional form). We should think disruptively and embrace the fourth industrial revolution.”"
127,2019-02-07,Reliance,"Reliance Ind to invest Rs 10,000 cr in Bengal for Jio expansion 
 
Reliance Industries Ltd has firmed up investment plans to the tune of ₹10,000 crore in West Bengal. A part of these proposals are already under implementation, its Chairman Mukesh Ambani said on Thursday.
Plans are also afoot to launch a ‘New Commerce’ platform (by Jio and Reliance Retail together) that will empower three crore small shopkeepers.
“We have firmed up our plan for an investment fo ₹10,000 crore. Part of it is already under implementation in West Bengal,” Ambani said at the fifth edition of the Bengal Global Business Summit, the State’s flagship investors’ meet.
Reliance Industries, he said, had made investments worth ₹4,500 crore for Jio in 2016, which at present stood at ₹28,000 crore. This, incidentally, is one tenth of the total investment the company has made so far.
According to Ambani, Reliance Retail operates 500 retail stores, 46 petro-retail outlets and 30,00,000 square feet of warehouses in the State. The warehouse and logistics operations are expected to get a boost with Reliance’s ‘New Commerce’ ventures coming into play."

   -  REUTERS


A majority of lenders to the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group has agreed to an in-principle standstill not to sell any of the promoters’ pledged shares till September, 30, 2019.
The agreement ensures that lenders, who have taken the group’s equity shares as collateral, would not enforce security and sell any of the promoters’ pledged shares on account of lower collateral cover or reduced margin due to the recent unprecedented fall in share prices of the group’s listed entities. According to sources close to the company, Reliance Group has committed to pay the principal and interest to the lenders, as per the scheduled due dates specified in the loan agreements.
The group has also appointed investment bankers to place a part of its direct 30 per cent shareholding in Reliance Power Ltd to target institutional investors, according to sources. The roadshow for the same is expected to start next week.
The sources added that the value of the promoter stake in Reliance Power, before the unprecedented fall in share prices earlier this month, was more than ₹2,500 crore, sufficient to clear more than 65 per cent of the total promoter borrowings. As Reliance Infrastructure holds 40 per cent equity in Reliance Power, majority stake and control would remain with the Anil Ambani Group even after placement of its holding by the promoters.
The group has, in total, nine lenders at the promoter level, with some of the key lenders being Templeton MF, DHFL Primeamerica MF, Indiabulls MF, IndusInd Bank and YES Bank.
The group has around ₹1,000-crore borrowings from Indian mutual funds, with Franklin Templeton having 90 per cent of the MF exposure. The fund has publicly supported Reliance Group promoters, labelling the transaction as “adequately covered”.
When contacted, a Reliance Group spokesperson said: “We are grateful to our lenders for believing in the intrinsic and fundamental value of our companies, and granting their in-principle approval to standstill arrangements.
Earlier this month, two lenders of the group – Edelweiss and L&T Finance – sold pledged shares in the open market to make up for the fall in collateral after share prices of Reliance Group companies fell sharply after the board of Reliance Communications decided to file for bankruptcy proceedings in the NCLT.
The move by Edelweiss and L&T Finance led to a near 55 per cent drop in the group’s market capitalisation, Reliance Group said, claiming the move was “illegal and motivated”.
According to the sources, the loan exposure of L&T Finance to the Group is now nil while that of Edelweiss is at ₹150 crore."

122,2019-02-19,Reliance,"RJio goes on offensive to combat ‘tower scam’


Owners of land parcels were promised a rent of ₹10,000-50,000 a month on signing a two-year contract for setting up tower sites

Owners of land parcels were promised a rent of ₹10,000-50,000 a month on signing a two-year contract for setting up tower sites
   -  THE HINDU


 After unearthing a mobile tower scam, which appears to be rampant across the country, Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio) has decided to contain the menace. 
The company discovered that scamsters claiming to be RJio representatives were mailing letters on forged letterheads to owners of land parcels, promising a rent of ₹10,000-50,000 a month (depending on the location) on signing a two-year contract for setting up tower sites. 
A person lured by the offer would be asked to deposit ₹7,000-14,000 into a bank account as a registration fee. The bank account would be kept running for another month or so in an attempt to dupe as many as possible. Then the scamsters would quietly withdraw their loot, close the account, shut down their phones and vanish. 
“A lot of farmers have fallen prey to this scam. There have been a number of instances in Jabalpur, Khadak (Pune district), Nashik, Indore and Prayagraj,” one of the sources said.
Hitting back, RJio is now filing at least 100 FIRs a month across the country, and is using social media to educate people about fake websites, rogue apps and mischievous social handles. The operator is also texting its subscribers, warning them of the scam.
“Be extra careful and verify the credentials of the person asking for money/advance for mobile tower installation. Jio never demands fee in any form for tower installation & please don’t pay if anybody asks for money,” said an SMS sent out by the company.
Additionally, RJio is issuing cautionary advertisements and working with registrars such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). 
RJio has also been fighting another scam — a mobile bill racket — since its inception. Fraudsters mail highly inflated mobile bills on forged letterheads, which are then followed up by a fake recovery team. The telco, as a policy, doesn’t mail hard copies of bills. 
A company spokesperson confirmed all the developments."

In the previous quarter, Jio topped in terms of standalone AGR

In the previous quarter, Jio topped in terms of standalone AGR
   -  The Hindu


 Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, could lose as much as Rs 150 billion ($2.1 billion) this fiscal year when costs such as handset subsidies are included, said Chris Lane and Samuel Chen, analysts at Sanford C Bernstein & Co.
That would be a bigger deficit than those of its larger rivals Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, even though the company known as Jio will probably overcome them over the next 12 months in terms of service revenue and subscribers, the analysts wrote in a note to clients dated February 26. The fiscal year of Jio’s parent, Reliance Industries Ltd ends March 31. 
Jio, part of the group controlled by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, introduced a free-for-life call service and a price war in one of the worlds most crowded mobile markets. That push, which has included offering low-cost phones, has resulted in net handset subsidies likely amounting to Rs 72 billion and a total invested capital of Rs 2.6 trillion, Bernstein estimates.
“The phone subsidies are carried by a separate unit, Reliance Retail Ltd, and so aren’t visible on Jio’s profit and loss statement, according to Lane and Chen. Jio also uses non-standard depreciation metrics in its accounting,” they said.
Ambani’s wireless phone business, which he has said may conduct an initial public offering, has reported consecutive quarterly profits. To make a positive return on investment, the carrier will have to reduce handset subsidies and increase revenue from users, according to Bernstein.
Vodafone Idea will probably post a net loss of Rs 32 billion for the year ending March. Bharti Airtel is expected to report a Rs 7.5 billion.."
120,2019-02-27,Reliance,"RJio ready to launch 5G services
Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), is ready to launch next generation 5G services in India, following allocation of spectrum by the Department of Communications (DoT). Further, Nasdaq-listed Radisys Corp, a company that was acquired by RIL in June last year, would be working with the industry to develop a 5G ecosystem in the country.
“There is no other operator in the country which is as ready as Rjio. We are the only company in the world with an Internet Protocol (IP) and all Voice over LTE (VoLTE) telecom network that can launch 5G services immediately,” RIL President Mathew Oommen told BusinessLine on the sideline of the Mobile World Congress 2019.
He, however, declined to provide a timeline for the launch, nor the spectrum frequency it would bid in case of auctions this year.
“Following the allocation of spectrum, a lot of testing and readying has to be conducted before we could launch the services,” he added.
The company has also sounded off authorities including licensor DoT and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) of its requirement of additional spectrum.
“We need additional spectrum, in addition to the 42-45 MHz we have,” he added.
Further, the company is also continuing to expand optical fibre deployments by adding “hundreds of thousands” of route kilometres. The telecom industry is expecting commercial launch of 5G services in India by end of 2020, that’s if spectrum allocation happens this year.
“We are already working on the disaggregation of network, which means that we will be vendor agnostic, we can add or remove any device making it a plug ‘n play network,” he said.
The 5G evolution, which the company is terming as the 2.0 transformation in the telecom sector, would be embarked upon “with or without” Reliance Communications (RCom) spectrum it was looking to acquire."
119,2019-03-03,Reliance,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (272.9) 
SBI began the week on a weak note and fell about 2 per cent initially. However, the stock managed to reverse sharply higher from the low of ₹266.3, recovering all the loss. The price action on the charts over the last couple of weeks leaves the near-term outlook positive. A key support is at ₹267, which is likely to limit the downside. An upmove to ₹280 and ₹285 is likely in the near term. A cluster of resistances is poised in the ₹280-285 zone. Inability to breach this resistance region can drag SBI to ₹270 again. But a strong break above ₹285 will boost the momentum and increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹295 and ₹300 in the coming weeks. Short-term traders with a high-risk appetite can go long at current levels and accumulate at ₹269. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹265 for the target of ₹285. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹276 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹279. The 200-week moving average at ₹260 is a crucial support. The outlook will turn negative only if SBI declines below this support.










ITC (₹277.8) 
ITC has been stuck in the ₹273-284 sideways range for more than a month now. Within this range, the near-term outlook is bullish. ITC has risen and closed above the 21-day moving average at ₹276.5, which will now act as a good support. As long as the stock trades above this support, an upmove to ₹284 is possible in the near term. A pull-back from ₹284 levels will keep the sideways range intact and take the stock lower to ₹277-275 again. But a decisive close above ₹284 will mark the end of the sideways consolidation. It will then take the stock initially to ₹289. A further break above ₹289 will then trigger a fresh rally, targeting ₹301. The bullish outlook will get negated only if ITC breaks below 273. The next target is ₹265. But the price action on the chart keeps the bias positive and leaves the possibility high of the stock breaching ₹284 in the coming days. As such, investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at ₹282, ₹278 and ₹272. Retain the stop-loss at ₹262.










Infosys (₹741.1) 
Infosys surged to a high of ₹757.8, but later gave back most of the gains. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 21-day moving average resistance is at ₹747. A decisive close above it is needed to turn the outlook to positive. Such a break can take Infosys higher to ₹790 and ₹800. But as long as the stock trades below ₹747, a dip to ₹725 cannot be ruled out in the near term. A break below ₹725 will then take the stock lower to ₹710 or even ₹700 thereafter. However, a further fall below ₹700 looks unlikely. A cluster of supports poised between ₹710 and ₹700 is likely to limit the downside. An upward reversal from the ₹710-700 support zone will trigger a fresh rally to ₹745 and ₹750. A further break above ₹750 will then give rise to targets of ₹770 and ₹790. Medium-term traders can make use of dips to go long at ₹725. Accumulate longs at ₹720 and ₹715. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹680 for a target of ₹790. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹735 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹755. 










RIL (₹1,226.7) 
RIL inched lower for the third consecutive week. The 21-day moving average resistance at ₹1,248 continued to cap the upside in the stock for the second consecutive week. RIL can remain range-bound between ₹1,200 and ₹1,250 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹1,200 or ₹1,250 will decide the direction of the next move. A strong break above ₹1,250 can take the stock initially to ₹1,260. A further decisive break above ₹1,260 will boost the momentum and increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹1,300 and ₹1,320 in the short term. On the other hand, if RIL declines decisively below ₹1,200, the stock will come under renewed pressure. In such a scenario, RIL can fall initially to ₹1,175. A further break below ₹1,175 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹1,145. It will also confirm the head and shoulder reversal pattern on the daily chart. This is a bearish pattern, which may keep the stock under pressure. Investors can hold the long positions taken at ₹1,260, ₹1,245 and ₹1,225. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,180 for the target of ₹1,420.










Tata Steel (₹507.1) 
Tata Steel has been moving higher as expected, but at a slow pace. The stock was up 1 per cent last week. The short-term outlook continues to remain positive. A near-term resistance is at ₹517 — the 100-day moving average. A pull-back from this resistance can trigger a fall to ₹495 and ₹490. A further fall below ₹490 looks unlikely at the moment. An upward reversal from the ₹495-490 support zone will take the stock higher to ₹515 levels again. An eventual break above the 100-day moving average resistance will then increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹545 and ₹550 thereafter. The upmove from the January low of ₹442 is significant as it happened from the 200-week moving average support. Whether the current move is a trend reversal or just a corrective rally will become clear in the coming weeks. Short-term traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹502. Retain the stop-loss at ₹480 for the target of ₹545. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹510 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹517."
118,2019-03-03,Reliance,"Five of top 10 firms together add Rs 35,503 crore in m-cap

The m-cap of SBI jumped by Rs 1,963.41 crore to Rs 2,43,597.3 crore and that of ICICI Bank rose by Rs 1,131.27 crore to Rs 2,27,770.4 crore.
On the other hand, the market valuation of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) dropped by Rs 7,110.87 crore to Rs 3,75,555.8 crore.
HDFC’s valuation declined by Rs 4,344.84 crore to Rs 3,19,880.7 crore, and that of RIL fell by Rs 3,739.81 crore to Rs 7,77,564.2 crore.

In terms of the m-cap value of these top 10 firms, RIL stood at number one place, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, HUL, ITC, Infosys, HDFC, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank.
Over the last week, the BSE Sensex rose 192.33 points, or 0.57 per cent, to close at 36,063.81."

 Reliance Industries on Wednesday said it has received final comments from market regulator SEBI for its proposed open offers to shareholders of Den Networks Limited and Hathway Cable and Datacom Limited.
The company will make the open offers in accordance with the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations 2011, RIL said in a BSE filing. “Comments on the draft letter of offer have been received from SEBI for the mandatory open offer to the shareholders of Hathway Bhawani Cabletel and Datacom Limited,” the filing said.
In October last year, Reliance Industries had announced it will buy majority stakes in Den Networks Ltd and Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd for Rs 5,230 crore. 
In DEN, Reliance is making a primary investment of Rs 2,045 crore through a preferential issue and secondary purchase of Rs 245 crore from existing promoters. In Hathway, RIL is making primary investment of Rs 2,940 crore through a preferential issue."

 Reliance Industries scion Akash Ambani on Saturday married Shloka Mehta, daughter of diamantaire Russel Mehta, at a glittering ceremony here.
The wedding took place at the country’s largest corporate house’s newly constructed convention centre in the Bandra Kurla Complex, a stone’s throw distance away from a school run by the Ambani family, where Akash and Shloka had studied together.
A concourse inside the ‘Jio World Centre’ hosted the baraat (wedding procession), which had Bollywood composers Vishal and Shekhar dishing out foot-tapping numbers.
Akash, his mother Nita, Bollywood personalities Shahrukh Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, Congress leader Rajiv Shukla, among others were seen shaking a leg, according to pictures doing the rounds on social media.
Other attendees at the wedding included Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, veteran industrialists Ratan Tata and N Chandrasekaran, and global chief executives of the Bank of America, Samsung and J P Morgan.
Former prime minister H D Deve Gowda, former British PM Tony Blair and his wife Cherie, and former UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon were also present at the wedding, celebrations for which are going to last over three days.
Tinsel town was represented by Rajinikanth, Aamir Khan, Priyanka Chopra and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, while the cricket world was represented by Yuvraj Singh, Hardik and Krunal Pandya.
The pre-wedding festivities lasted till about 8.15pm, after which the marriage ceremony began at an exquisitely decorated hall, sources said.
An elaborate spread featuring world cuisines has been prepared for the wedding, the second in the Ambani family after the December wedding of daughter Isha to Anand Piramal’s son Anant.
A key highlight of the wedding is a musical fountain-cum-dance show, which also includes aerial acts, signifying a symmetry between water, earth and sky, according to sources.
The performance, by 150 Indian and international artistes, is set on the theme of Raas Lila, they said."

112,2019-03-31,Reliance,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (320.8)
The uptrend in SBI is gaining momentum. The stock surged 7.6 per cent last week, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹305. Resistance is near current levels at around ₹321. A pull-back from that can trigger a corrective fall to ₹315. A break below ₹315 can drag the stock lower to ₹305. However, the bias continues to remain positive. So, a further fall below ₹305 looks less probable. A bounce from ₹305 will have the potential to take the stock above ₹321. In such a scenario, a rally to ₹350 is likely. The indicators on the charts are positive. The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 55-, 100- and 200-day moving averages. This is a strong bullish sign, indicating that the downside could be limited and the uptrend is likely to remain in place. Short-term traders can wait for dips and go long at ₹315 and accumulate at ₹308. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹295 for the target of ₹350. Revise the stop-loss to ₹325 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹335.










ITC (296.7)
ITC was volatile last week. The stock fell initially to a low of ₹291.2 and bounced back to make a high of ₹302.95. However, it fell in the final trading session of the week, giving back all the gains and closed on a flat note. The resistance at ₹302 is holding well. ITC has to make a decisive close above this hurdle to regain strength and move higher. The next target is ₹309. The level of ₹309 is a key long-term trend resistance. Inability to rise past this level can trigger a corrective fall to ₹302 or ₹300. But a strong break above ₹309 will increase the likelihood of the rally extending to ₹320 and ₹322 over the medium term. On the other hand, if ITC continues to trade below ₹302, a dip to ₹293 or ₹290 is possible. Investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at ₹282, ₹278 and ₹272 with a revised stop-loss at ₹289. Move the stop-loss further higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹305. Book profits at ₹310.










Infosys (₹742.3)
Infosys tumbled 3 per cent intraweek and made a low of ₹719.6. However, the stock reversed sharply higher recovering all the loss. The bias remains positive on the chart. The 21-day moving average at ₹726 is a key support. The quick bounce from ₹719 indicates that the stock is getting fresh buyers below ₹726. So as long as the stock trades above the 21-day moving average support, there is a strong likelihood of it moving higher to ₹750-₹755. A further break above ₹755 will then increase the likelihood of the uptrend extending to ₹780. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if Infosys makes a decisive close below the 21-day moving average. A fall to ₹705 or ₹700 is possible. A further fall below ₹700 looks less probable at the moment. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹725, ₹720 and ₹715. Retain the stop-loss at ₹680 for the target of ₹790. Revise the stop-loss to ₹735 as the stock moves up to ₹755.










RIL (₹1,363)
RIL opened the week with a gap-down and fell to a low of ₹1,317.15. However, the negative sentiment was short-lived and RIL clawed back, recovering all the loss and closed 1.5 per cent higher for the week. The support at ₹1,316 mentioned last week has held very well. This leaves the bullish outlook intact. A near-term resistance is at ₹1,385, which is likely to be tested in the coming days. Inability to breach this hurdle can drag the stock lower to ₹1,350 initially. A further break below ₹1,350 will then increase the likelihood of the downmove extending to ₹1,315 or ₹1,310. But, if RIL manages to break above ₹1,385, it can gain fresh strength. In such a scenario, RIL can surge to ₹1,400. A strong break above ₹1,400 will be very bullish from a long-term perspective. This will pave way for ₹1,450 and ₹1,500 over the long term. The outlook for the stock will turn negative only if RIL declines below ₹1,300. Such a break can trigger a corrective fall to ₹1,260 and ₹1,250.










Tata Steel (₹520.8)
Tata Steel continued to consolidate for the fourth consecutive week. The stock has been stuck between ₹505 and ₹532. A breakout on either side of ₹505 or ₹532 will decide the next move. If Tata Steel breaks the range below ₹505, it can fall to ₹495 or ₹490. But such a fall looks less likely as the price action on the chart leaves the possibility high of the stock breaking above ₹532. The stock is well above the 21-week moving average level of ₹507. As long as it trades above this support, the bias will remain positive. A strong break above ₹532 will take Tata Steel to ₹540. A further break above ₹540 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹560 over the medium term. Traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹518 and ₹512. Retain the stop-loss at ₹487 for the target of ₹555. Revise the stop-loss to ₹515 on a rally to ₹525.

Internet of things (IoT) provider Unlimit, a part of the Reliance ADA Group, said it is expecting revenue of around $200 million by 2020 and will soon ramp up hiring.
The Mumbai-headquartered company — which employs around 85 people — will be hiring 100 more next year, Juergen Hase, Chief Executive Officer, Unlimit told BusinessLine. 
“We are targeting a revenue of closed to $200 million by 2020 as we are growing in all the areas that we serve. We achieved this year’s targeted revenue in December,” Hase said, declining to disclose any figures.
According to sources, the company’s current revenue stands at less than $100 million. 
Speaking on the sidelines of the MG Motor India event here, where Unlimit showcased its capability in connected cars, Hase said the market for connected vehicles will grow manifold in future. 
More than 50 per cent of the company’s revenue will come from this segment. 
The company will provide the MG Hector iSmart Next Gen, which will be embedded with a machine-to-machine Sim, ensuring the car remains connected. 
The customised solution has been developed by Unlimit in partnership with Cisco and Airtel, which have collaborated with their Jasper platform and telecommunication network, respectively.
Unlimit has partnerships with many operators in the country, such as BSNL and Vodafone-Idea, for providing various IoT services.
It is also partnering with around 500 local partners in the country to provide such services, and will add more in the future as per the demand. 
“These partners have rich experience in India, which is very important. Partnering with even a top company from Silicon Valley wouldn’t make sense if it doesn’t have experience in India,” Hase said."
109,2019-04-03,Reliance,"Broker's call: Reliance Industries (Neutral)
Motilal Oswal
Reliance Industries (Neutral)
CMP: ₹1,373.8
Target: ₹1,457
Reliance Industries’s stock price has almost tripled over the last five years, outperforming the Nifty by 122 per cent on a cumulative basis. This has been driven by the strengthening refining/petrochem businesses and the significant build-up in its retail and telecom segments.
Since our upgrade in October 2017, RIL has rallied by 59 per cent, outperforming the Nifty by 44 per cent. The stock now trades closer to our fair value. Moreover, we expect the core business to face headwinds in 2019.
Global refining and petrochem peers are trading at about 6x FY20 EV/EBITDA. We value RIL’s refining and petrochemical segments at 7.5x — the premium here reflects the company’s superior capability to manage the crude basket, refinery yields, hedging and multiple feedstock for its petrochem segment.
While telecom and retail remain in a significant build-up mode, we have already factored this in our estimates. As there is limited upside from here, we downgrade the stock to ‘Neutral’ from Buy."

The app is available on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. JioNews, apart from providing news, would also offer Live TV, videos, magazines, newspapers and much more, the company said in a statement.

107,2019-04-16,Reliance,"Reliance Jio applies for in-flight connectivity licence to DoT 
 Reliance Jio Infocomm has approached the telecom department for in-flight connectivity licence, that allows service providers to offer connectivity and data services to Indian and foreign airlines, according to sources.
 Besides Jio, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has also received a clutch of other applications including those from Ortus Communications, Station Satcom and Cloud Cast Digital, sources privy to the development told PTI. Reliance Jio, however, declined to comment on a questionnaire sent in this regard.
 Sources, meanwhile, said that in some of the cases including that of Ortus Communications, the DoT has sought some clarification on the application submitted. After the government notified rules for in-flight and maritime mobile phone services in December last year, a number of companies including Bharti Airtel, Hughes Communications India, and Tatanet Services queued up for the said licence.
 In February this year, Hughes Communications India (HCIL) became the the first company to be granted the in-flight and maritime connectivity licence in the country. The following month, Tatanet Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nelco, announced that it had obtained in-flight, maritime connectivity licence from the government.
 Most recently, the DoT issued a 10-year licence to Bharti Airtel subsidiary Indo Teleports Ltd to provide such services. According to Euroconsult, over 23,000 commercial aircraft will offer connectivity to their passengers by 2027, up from 7,400 aircraft in 2017. 
 Northern Sky Research’s Aeronautical Satcom Market’s 2017 report predicts that by the end of 2019, broadband VSAT (very small aperture terminal) connectivity will be installed on one out of every three commercial passenger aircraft, and will rise to two out of every three by the end of 2026.
 Fuelled by rising demand for broadband connectivity, this installed base is estimated to generate over $ 32 billion in revenue over the next decade, as air travel continues its rise around the world.
 The connectivity needs in maritime industry are also growing leaps and bounds, as increasing number of vessels look to stay connected to provide their crew and passengers high-speed internet access, monitoring weather patterns to cut fuel costs, filing regulatory documents, ordering supplies from sea to save time in port, and generating business intelligence."

Reliance Industries stock posts biggest intraday per cent gain in over two weeks.
   -  Reuters


Shares of Reliance Industries rise as much as 3.1 per cent to Rs 1,385, their highest since April 3. The stock posts biggest intraday per cent gain in over two weeks as the company is scheduled to report March quarter results later in the day.
Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, is in talks to buy a stake in co's refining and petrochemicals businesses, sources said on Wednesday. The stock is the biggest boost on the broader NSE index.
Reliance Industries was in talks to buy British toy store chain Hamleys, according to media reports. However, Reliance declined to comment.
Up to Tuesday's close, stock was up 19.84 per cent so far this year. The stock of Reliance Industries was ended higher by 2.79 per cent to Rs 1,382.90 in the BSE index while in the broader Nifty the stock closed 3.15 per cent higher at Rs 1,386.05"

 A marriage of convenience?
In February Saudi Arabia’s National Oil Company, Saudi Aramco’s, CEO, Amin Al Nasser, said, “India is an investment priority for Saudi Aramco. There is a lot of growth potential. We are looking at additional investments in India. We are in discussions with other companies as well, including Reliance Industries.”
And a few days back news came that Mukesh Ambani’s RIL is reportedly in talks to sell a 25 per cent stake in its refinery and petrochem business to Saudi Aramco for an estimated $10-15 billion. This of course got the oil and trading industry talking. Why would Ambani do it? Refinery and Petrochem are his premium assets and a revenue earner he doesn’t need money for the business. Is it to revive his petroleum retail business or is it to foot the bill for Reliance Jio’s expenses?
While Aramco can fulfil its desire to tap the huge petroleum retail business of India, Ambani would get assured crude oil supply, if the deal is indeed struck.
Debates and discussions continue with some even stating that the deal will close in the next few months. While those closely associated with the developments maintain there is no finality as yet, we probably have to wait for Ambani and his core team to unravel the mystery behind this.
Data disturbance
Missing links in the network seem to be causing disruptions for the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. Once a very transparent Ministry, this nodal point for implementation of clean energy projects used to regularly publish installed capacity numbers for solar and wind energy. There also used to be a column for renewable energy equipment manufacturing facilities. But, the release of this data has been on the back burner for a while. And no reason has been given. Is it because of disappointing installation numbers and stagnation in new manufacturing facilities?
Boon or bane?
The Odisha government’s ad hoc implementation of the KALIA scheme promising financial aid to small and marginal farmers could prove to be either a boon or a bane for the ruling Biju Janta Dal.
While some policy watchers are of the opinion that the inclusion of some undeserving people in the list of beneficiaries and the exclusion of many deserving farmers could result in the Naveen Patnaik government losing some votes there are others who think the opposite. They argue that those left out would want Patnaik back in the hope that he would fulfil his promise of including them in the list after the elections. Which way the tide will turn will be clear only after the completion of the election process next month. Till then the contestants might as well keep their fingers crossed!
The AAP-Cong tie-up saga
In Delhi, AAP and Congress have been blowing hot and cold over a pre-poll alliance. For the nth time talks have broken down and both party leaders tweeted their angst. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi even said they were willing to give four seats to AAP. 
According to a source the bone of contention is the East Delhi seat. AAP candidate Atishi Marlena has put in enormous work in the constituency beginning her campaign fairly early. However, reportedly the Dikshits want the seat — at first Sandeep Dikshit’s name was suggested, but that was not acceptable to the AAP.

Public sector lenders not giving a helping hand to Jet Airways has left may of us confounded. Consider this. 
The government’s enthusiasm has now clearly waned, according to banking industry insiders. Moreover, several of the banks did not want good money to be thrown after bad, a lesson learnt by them the hard way in the Kingfisher Airlines saga!
And finally several bankers, it seems, have strong memories of a Bank Chief (IDBI) still behind bars for supporting the cause of the aviation industry.

 Shares of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), the country’s most valued company with a market capitalistion of over Rs 8.82 lakh crore, can be found in the portfolios of several leaders, while stocks and mutual fund units of the firms from younger brother Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group are also a common sight, as per disclosures made in election affidavits of the contestants.
 However, some top leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi have no stock market or mutual fund exposure at all and their financial savings are limited to deposits in banks, tax-free bonds, insurance policies and instruments like National Savings Certificate.
 The direct equity investments for a few are limited to unlisted companies, including those owned by their families.
 BJP President Amit Shah has disclosed a long list of listed and unlisted shares in his name and in the name of his spouse. The listed shares in his name, totalling over Rs 17.5 crore, include companies from Aditya Birla Group, Bajaj, L&T, Tata and both Reliance groups, as also several PSUs.
 Congress chief Rahul Gandhi has disclosed equity holding in Young Indian and investments in several mutual funds. The portfolio of his mother and senior party leader Sonia Gandhi includes equity shares of Young Indian and Maruti Technical Services Pvt Ltd and mutual fund units of HDFC, Kotak, Motilal Oswal and Reliance MF.
 NCP’s Supriya Sule, daughter of veteran leader Sharad Pawar, has got unlisted shares worth over Rs 1 crore and listed shares worth over Rs 6 crore, besides some mutual funds.
 The listed shares include those of Adani Group firms, the two Reliance groups, several Tata firms and even Kingfisher Airlines as also of some other companies from the erstwhile UB Group, including United Spirits which was sold by defaulter businessman Vijay Mallya to global liquor giant Diageo Plc.
 Kingfisher shares have long been delisted from the stock exchanges, though they quoted at above Rs 300 apiece once. The stocks eventually slipped below Re 1 and trading was eventually suspended in 2014-end after mounting troubles for the erstwhile luxury airline had led to its closure.
 Union minister and BJP candidate from Nagpur Nitin Gadkari has equity shares of Purti Power and Sugar Ltd, among other investments.
 Poonam Mahajan, BJP candidate from Mumbai North Central, has disclosed listed equity investments by her spouse in Kingfisher Airlines, as also in Reliance Industries, TCS, Vodafone Idea Cellular and Reliance Power.
 Her Congress rival Priya Dutt has listed several mutual fund and portfolio schemes totalling about Rs 14.92 crore, while the listed shares disclosed in the name of her spouse include Reliance Industries, Reliance Infra and Reliance Power.
 Congress candidate from Mumbai South, Murli Deora, has disclosed multiple bonds, structured market products, PMS account, mutual funds and FMPs (fixed maturity plans).
 Actress-turned-politician Urmila Matondkar, Congress candidate from Mumbai North, has disclosed Rs 28.28 crore worth investment in shares, bonds and mutual funds and PMS (portfolio management service) investments worth about Rs 6 crore, but the individual stocks/units were not disclosed.
 Jaya Prada, another former actress and the BJP candidate from Rampur in Uttar Pradesh, has also disclosed investments in some listed companies such as Energy Development Company Ltd (which has got her political mentor Amar Singh as a promoter), Coal India, HDFC Bank, ITC, MCX and Reliance Industries.
 Actor-politician Raj Babbar, the Congress candidate from Fatehpur Sikri, has investments in IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd.
 Among other Uttar Pradesh candidates, Union minister and BJP leader Satyapal Singh has disclosed investments worth Rs 1.5 lakh in mutual funds and bonds in his name and some equity shares held by his spouse including of Reliance Capital and Reliance Industries.
 Another union minister V K Singh and his spouse have also invested in various mutual funds.

101,2019-04-30,Reliance,"Can Reliance repeat its telecom success in e-commerce? Experts are divided
As Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Retail, the retail arm of Reliance Industries, gears to enter e-commerce in the next few months, the key question is whether it can disrupt the market the way Reliance Jio did in telecom. 
Reliance already has a presence in the online segment with its fashion portal Ajio.com and Reliancetrends.com which compete with fashion e-tailers Myntra, Jabong and Koovs. Soon, it will launch a consolidated e-commerce platform to take on Amazon.in and Walmart-owned Flipkart.com that currently sell everything from vegetables to large home appliances. 
However, Amazon and Flipkart are marketplaces and not e-tailers governed by FDI rules. 
Reliance might enter the segment as a pure-play online retailer since it is an Indian company and has no external investors. While experts believe that Reliance — which currently owns the largest network of offline retail stores across categories selling vegetables, grocery, electronics, jewellery, fashion and appliances — can have an edge over existing players who depend largely on third-party sellers, it is unlikely to make much of a difference to customers as Amazon and Flipkart already control about 90 per cent of the total e-commerce market.
“We understand that Reliance can afford to offer massive discounts in its e-commerce business, but that is not a sustainable leadership strategy since Amazon and Flipkart have essentially acquired most of the market share, using aggressive discounting,” said Devangshu Dutta, Founder of consultancy firm Third Eyesight.
On whether Reliance will do to e-commerce what it did with telecom, Dutta said that the telecom market was constrained by high prices when Reliance launched its mobile business and Reliance actually expanded the market hugely with handsets, calls and data at lowest rates. “But retail is not the same story. In shopping, there is no price barrier to market explosion,” Dutta said. 
N Chandramouli, CEO of research advisory firm TRA, said, “Reliance is definitely going to be a game-changer in the online retail business in India as it has an integrated approach, which is unparalleled across the world due to its network, offline retail, songs and Jio TV to provide an overall customer experience.” 
He added that majority of Jio customers are low ARPU rurban (rural+urban) users and are a largely untapped market for many e-commerce players. If it manages to make the last mile delivery to the customer smooth, it will be able to build their trust and grab a share of the e-commerce space.
Earlier this year, the company had announced acquisition of a logistics company called Grab-a-Grub and is likely to make a few more. Reliance Retail, with a revenue of more than ₹100,000 crore, is likely to optimise the company-owned supermarkets, hypermarkets, and wholesale and kirana stores to make a significant mark in the e-commerce space that is likely to touch $84 billion by 2021. The company is already piloting its B2B e-commerce venture for sellers in Telangana.
“There is definitely space for another large player in the e-commerce segment,” said Anil Kumar, CEO of Redseer Consulting, adding that Reliance initially is likely to launch a marketplace and then slowly turn inventory-led by creating complex back-end structures/companies for a more sustainable model. 
He further said that players like Amazon and Flipkart might look like marketplaces, but are actually running as inventory-led models, where they can standardise the products and keep prices under their control, a feature that marketplace lacks which leads to bad customer experience."
100,2019-05-05,Reliance,"Six of top-10 companies lose Rs 64,219 cr in m-cap 
 The combined market valuation of six of the 10 most valued Indian companies plunged by Rs 64,219.2 crore last week, with IT giant TCS suffering the biggest drop.
ITC, HUL, Infosys, SBI and ICICI Bank were the other firms which witnessed a slide in their market capitalisation (m-cap) for the week ended Friday, while Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), HDFC Bank, HDFC and Kotak Mahindra Bank finished with gains.
The m-cap of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) slumped Rs 39,700.2 crore to stand at Rs 8,00,196.04 crore.
HUL’s valuation tumbled Rs 11,029.2 crore to Rs 3,66,441.16 crore and that of Infosys dropped Rs 5,832.53 crore to Rs 3,16,201.41 crore.
The market cap of ICICI Bank eroded by Rs 3,558.82 crore to Rs 2,59,087.06 crore and that of SBI declined Rs 2,811.25 crore to reach Rs 2,75,904.37 crore. ITC’s valuation fell by Rs 1,287.15 crore to Rs 3,72,172.06 crore.
In contrast, the m-cap of HDFC Bank zoomed by Rs 25,492.79 crore to Rs 6,45,508.46 crore. The valuation of RIL jumped Rs 9,888.45 crore to Rs 8,91,893.89 crore and that of Kotak Mahindra Bank climbed Rs 7,654.43 crore to Rs 2,70,701.52 crore. HDFC’s m-cap advanced Rs 6,102.5 crore to Rs 3,46,008.92 crore.
In the list of top-10 firms, RIL was placed at the number one position, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, ITC, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), HDFC, Infosys, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank.

Indian carrier Bharti Airtel registered profit bolstered by one-time gains
   -  Reuters




In a war for the control of India’s billion-plus mobile-services market, tycoon Sunil Mittal seems to be floundering in the face of a juggernaut unleashed by Mukesh Ambani.
For at least a fourth quarter in a row, Mittal’s Bharti Airtel Ltd. shored up its profits with one-time gains, masking headwinds posed by upstart Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Jio’s roll-out, after its 2016 debut, has knocked Airtel from its perch in a consolidation that shrank the industry to three players from about a dozen four years ago.
Read also: Bharti Airtel Q4 consolidated net up 37%
Airtel is struggling to add subscribers in a saturated market after Jio managed to lure more than 300 million users over the past three years -- a quarter of the world’s second-largest market. The aggressive expansion of Jio with free calls and cheaper data, backed by the deep pockets of Asia’s richest man, was bad news for highly indebted incumbents engaged in a tariff war that had pushed call rates to less than a cent.
Shriveling earnings portend further trouble for Airtel. Already saddled with more than $17 billion of debt -- the highest among Asian peers -- it is also preparing to spend billions more on 5G airwaves at a government auction in coming months. Adding to its woes, Moody’s Investors Service cut its rating to junk earlier this year.
The New Delhi-based company is counting on some asset sales, a rights issue and an initial public offering in London of its Africa unit to bolster its finances.
Airtel said in an exchange filing on Monday that a one-time net gain of ₹ 2,020 crore ($291 million) on account of a credit related to re-assessment of levies boosted its net income to ₹ 110 crore for the quarter through March. 
Although revenue rose 6 percent to ₹ 20,600 crore in the period, data provided by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India show Airtel added a net 53,493 subscribers in the first two months of the year, compared with Jio’s 17.1 million. While Airtel didn’t provide user addition data for the quarter, Jio reported an increase of 26.6 million."
98,2019-05-12,Reliance,"Consider bear put spread on RIL
Though the long-term outlook for Reliance Industries (₹1,246) remains positive, in the short term, it may remain volatile with a negative bias.
The stock faces an immediate support at ₹1,220, and a close below that will drag it towards ₹1,108 or even to ₹1,027.
A close below the latter will alter even the long-term bullish view. On the other hand, a close above ₹1,372 will trigger a fresh rally.
F&O Pointers: Open interests remain stable at around 4.2 crore despite the stock remaining under pressure in the past few days.
Options trading indicates a range of ₹1,200-1,400 for the stock.
Strategy: Traders could consider a bear put spread on RIL. This can be done by buying the ₹1,260 put and simultaneously selling the ₹1,220 put. These options closed with a premium of ₹50.5 and ₹33.05, which means one has to shell out ₹17.45 a contract.
The maximum loss would be ₹8,725 as the market lot is 500 units, and that will happen if the stock rises and closes above ₹1,260 at the time of expiry.
A maximum profit of ₹11,275 is possible if RIL closes below ₹1,220.
We advise traders to hold the position till expiry. Traders should bear it in mind that selling options costs higher margin commitments.

Resistance may cap upside in SBI
SBI (₹308.05)










SBI tumbled over 5 per cent intra-week, breaking below the key support level of ₹302. However, it clawed back from the low of ₹292.2, recovering almost all the loss after the fourth-quarter results announcement on Friday. Though the weekly candle gives a mixed signal, the daily chart is relatively positive. A key support is at ₹302, which can limit the downside; resistance is at ₹313. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹321-322. A pull-back from ₹322 can trigger a corrective fall to ₹312. But a strong break above ₹322 will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹330-335. Given the weakness in the broader markets, such a strong rally looks less probable. So the upside is likely to be limited to ₹322 at the moment. On the other hand, if SBI fails to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹313, a fall to ₹302 or even ₹297 is possible. As such, the impact of Friday's results will be short-lived and the overall negative sentiment in the market could weigh on the stock. In that case, SBI can fall to ₹ 290 and ₹287.
Uptrend in ITC under threat
ITC (₹297.7)










ITC moved up in the initial part of the week but failed to sustain higher. The uptrend that has been in place since late February seems to be under threat. A key support is at ₹295 which is likely to be tested in the near term. The stock has to hold above this support in order to keep the sentiment positive. A break below ₹295 can drag the stock initially lower to ₹288-287. A further break below ₹287 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹280-278. Such a fall to ₹280-278 will be a good buying opportunity from a long-term perspective. Investors with a long-term perspective can take long positions at ₹285 and accumulate at ₹282 and ₹278. On the other hand, if ITC manages to sustain above ₹295 in the coming days, a bounce to ₹302 — the crucial 21-day moving average resistance — is possible. The stock has to surpass this hurdle to bring back the bullish momentum. Else, a pull-back to ₹295 is possible again. In that case, ITC can remain range-bound between ₹295 and ₹302 for some time.
Infosys can witness a fresh fall
Infosys (₹716.05)










Infosys has crucial supports in the ₹706-703 region, which can be tested in the near term. It’s ability to sustain above this support zone will decide its next move. A bounce from the ₹706-703 support region will ease the downside pressure. It will increase the possibility of the stock moving higher to ₹730-735 in the short term. It will also keep the broader ₹700-775 sideways range intact. Infosys has been trading in this range since mid-January. But if the stock breaks below ₹703 in the coming days, it will come under renewed pressure. Such a break will take the stock initially lower to ₹690-685. A further break below ₹685 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹670-665 on profit-booking. Indicators on the chart favour a decline below ₹703 and a fall to ₹670-665 in the coming weeks. However, the region between ₹670 and ₹665 is a crucial long-term support, which may halt the fall. A decisive bounce from the ₹670-665 support zone could be a good buying opportunity from a long-term perspective.
Outlook turns bearish for RIL
RIL (₹1,250.5)










Contrary to an expectation of a rise, RIL tumbled 11 per cent last week. Morgan Stanley, a global brokerage firm, downgrading the stock seems to have made investors book profits, triggering this sharp sell-off. The uptrend that has been in place since October 2018 has reversed, and the outlook has turned bearish. Though there is some support near the current levels, the broader picture is negative. So, any bounce from the current levels may be short-lived and could be restricted to ₹1,300-1,320. A further fall to ₹1,200-1,180 is possible in the coming days. The region around ₹1,180 is a strong long-term trend support which can halt the fall. A bounce from there will be bullish from a long-term perspective. Investors can start buying RIL at ₹1,200 and also accumulate at ₹1,285 and ₹1,295. However, the possibility of a prolonged sideways move between ₹1,180 and ₹1,300 cannot be ruled out after this fall. As such, the rally to fresh highs thereafter might take time. So, investors buying around ₹1,200 will need to be patient and hold the stock for a long period of time.
Down-move to extend in Tata Steel
Tata Steel (₹487.3)










Tata Steel tumbled 11 per cent last week. Reports that the company’s joint venture with German steel maker Thyssenkrupp may not go through was a major trigger for the sell-off in the stock last week. The resistance at ₹560 has held well. It also keeps intact the downtrend that has been in place since January 2018. A strong resistance is in the ₹505-510 region which can cap the upside. A rally beyond ₹510 looks unlikely now. Also, an intermediate bounce to this resistance zone is likely to find fresh sellers coming into the market. A fall to ₹455-450 or even ₹440 is likely in the coming days. A further break below ₹440 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹425 or even ₹400. Traders with a short-term perspective can make use of rallies to go short at ₹498 and ₹505. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹522 for the target of ₹455. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹490 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹475.

 Nine of the 10 most valued Indian companies suffered a combined erosion of Rs 1.60 lakh crore in market valuation last week, with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) taking the biggest knock.
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) was the lone gainer among the 10 frontline companies, while the rest nine saw their market capitalisation (m-cap) plummet for the week ended Friday.
RIL’s valuation plunged Rs 99,212.9 crore to Rs 7,92,680.96 crore. 
 HDFC Bank’s market cap eroded by Rs 19,634 crore to Rs 6,25,874.51 crore and that of HDFC dropped Rs 13,573.5 crore to Rs 3,32,435.38 crore.
The M-cap of ICICI Bank dived Rs 10,974.8 crore to Rs 2,48,112.25 crore and of ITC tumbled Rs 7,232.6 crore to Rs 3,64,939.46 crore.
 The valuation of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd diminished by Rs 4,409.41 crore to Rs 2,66,292.11 crore and that of Infosys decreased by Rs 3,364.07 crore to stand at Rs 3,12,837.34 crore.
 HUL’s m-cap fell by Rs 1,233.88 crore to Rs 3,65,207.28 crore and of SBI declined Rs 981.71 crore to Rs 2,74,922.66 crore.
 In contrast, TCS added Rs 1,144.48 crore to its valuation to reach Rs 8,01,340.52 crore.
 In the order of top-10 firms, TCS was at the number one position, followed by RIL, HDFC Bank, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), ITC, HDFC, Infosys, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank.
 Markets buckled under selling pressure for the eighth straight session Friday -- marking their longest losing streak since mid-February -- as investors remained on the sidelines amid the US-China trade tensions and lacklustre corporate earnings.

 Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Monday surpassed Reliance Industries (RIL) to become the most valued firm by market valuation.

94,2019-06-15,Reliance,"Weekly Trading Guide 
SBI (₹343.8)
SBI was stuck in a narrow range between ₹339 and ₹349 last week. The near-term outlook is mixed. SBI can trade sideways between the significant support at ₹335 and resistance at ₹350 for some time. Within this range, there is a strong likelihood of the stock falling to ₹335 — the lower end of the range in the early part of this week. A breakout on either side of ₹335 or ₹350 will decide the direction of the next move. A break below ₹335 can take SBI lower to ₹325 and ₹320. As being reiterated over the last couple of weeks, the region around ₹320 is a strong long-term resistance-turned-support, which can limit the downside. Fresh buyers are likely to emerge around this level. As such, a fall to ₹325-₹320 will be a good buying opportunity from a medium-term perspective. On the other hand, if SBI breaks above ₹350, it can move up to the next crucial resistance level of ₹362. SBI has to rise past ₹362 decisively to gain fresh bullish momentum. Targets above ₹362 are ₹390 and ₹400.










ITC (₹277.9)
 ITC has been managing to sustain above the crucial long-term support level of ₹275. However, the stock is not gaining strength for a strong rally. This indicates lack of fresh buying interest in the stock. ITC has to break above ₹282 to get a breather. Such a break can take it up towards ₹287 and ₹290. Only a strong rise past ₹290 will confirm the trend reversal, which will then pave way for the next targets of ₹300 and ₹310. But such a strong upmove looks unlikely at the moment. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average and is now on the verge of crossing below the 100-day moving average. This is a negative signal, indicating that the upside could be limited. It also keeps the possibilities open of the stock breaking below `275. As such, if ITC breaks below ₹275, the downside pressure will increase. In such a scenario, the current downtrend will remain intact and the stock can extend the fall to ₹265 and ₹260 thereafter. 










Infosys (₹740.4)
 Infosys moved up last week as expected, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹758.9 and reversed sharply lower, giving back almost all the gains. The resistance at ₹755 has held well. Key near-term supports are at ₹734 (21-week moving average) and ₹730 (21-day moving average), which are likely to limit the downside. A break and fall below ₹730 looks less probable now. As long as the stock trades above ₹730, the outlook will remain positive. An upward reversal from the ₹734-₹730 support zone can take the stock higher to ₹755 again. An eventual break above ₹755 will then take Infosys up to ₹770 and ₹775 — the upper end of the ₹695-₹775 sideways range. The stock has been stuck in this broad sideways range since mid-January this year. If it manages to rise past ₹775, it can gain fresh momentum and target ₹790 and ₹800. But a pull-back from ₹775 will keep the sideways range intact. In such a scenario, Infosys can fall-back initially to ₹760-₹750 and even lower thereafter. 










RIL (₹1,316.95)
RIL managed to sustain above ₹1,300 but is not gaining strength to move higher. The price action over the last few weeks increases the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,300. Inability to rise past ₹1,338 (55-day moving average) and a subsequent fall last week, strengthens the case for a fall below ₹1,300. RIL will come under renewed pressure on a break below ₹1,300 and can move lower to ₹1,280-1,275. This move could be sharp and swift. A further break below 1,275 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to 1,250 and even 1,220 over the medium term. On the other hand, if RIL manages to sustain above 1,300, a bounce to 1,338 is possible again. A break above 1,338 will then increase the possibility of the upmove extending to 1,350 and 1,360. The region between 1,360 and 1,365 is a crucial resistance. RIL has to rise past 1,365 to gain fresh momentum and target 1,400 and 1,430. But such a strong upmove looks unlikely at the moment. 










Tata Steel (₹501.4)
 Contrary to our expectation of a fall, Tata Steel surged last week. The stock was up 4 per cent. Support for the stock is in the ₹490-488 region. As long as the stock trades above this support zone, the near-term outlook will remain positive. A rise to ₹515-520 is likely. The region around 520 is a crucial long-term trend resistance. As such, Tata Steel has to rise past ₹520 decisively to turn the outlook bullish and also to signal a trend reversal. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹527-530. A further break above ₹530 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its upmove to ₹560 over the medium term. Inability to breach ₹520 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹500 and ₹490. A break below ₹490 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹460. In such a scenario, Tata Steel can trade in a sideways range between ₹460 and ₹520.

SBI fell about 3 per cent in the initial part of the week. However, the stock managed to claw-back from the low of ₹333.75, recovering all the loss and closed 1.6 per cent higher for the week. An immediate resistance is at ₹352 for the stock which can be tested in the near future. A strong rise past this hurdle will take the stock higher to the next crucial resistance level of ₹362. 










As mentioned last week, SBI has to breach ₹362 decisively to gain fresh bullish momentum and target ₹390 and ₹400. But a pull-back from ₹362 can drag SBI lower to ₹350 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹335 and ₹362 for some more time. On the other hand, if SBI fails to surpass the immediate resistance level of ₹352, it can fall to ₹335 again. In that case, SBI can trade between ₹335 and ₹352 for some time. The stock will come under pressure if it declines below ₹335 levels. Such a break can take the stock lower to ₹325-320. The region around ₹320 is a strong long-term support and a further fall below it is unlikely.
 
ITC (₹274.2)
ITC continued to trade lower and has declined below ₹275 as expected. The stock was down 1.3 per cent last week. The outlook is bearish. Strong resistance is in the ₹280-282 region, which has been capping the upside over the last few weeks. Intermediate support is at ₹272.5. If this support holds, a range-bound move between ₹272.5 and ₹282 is possible for some time. 










However, the bias will continue to remain negative as the indicators on the charts are negative. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 100-day moving average as expected. This indicates that the downtrend is intact and the upside could be limited. An eventual break below ₹272.5 will bring renewed pressure on the stock. Such a break below will increase the likelihood of it tumbling towards ₹265 and ₹260. The levels of ₹262 and ₹257 are crucial long-term supports. The current downtrend is likely to find a bottom around these levels. A strong bounce from these supports will mark the beginning of a long-term uptrend in this stock.
 
Infosys (₹750.7)
Infosys has been stuck inbetween its support at ₹735 and resistance at ₹759 over the last couple of weeks. Within this range, the stock fell to ₹735 and bounced sharply from there to close 1.4 per cent higher last week. The 21-week moving average support level of ₹735 has held very well as expected and keeps the bullish view intact. 
 










The immediate resistance level of ₹759 is likely to be tested in the near term. The bias on the chart is positive. The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 55-day moving average. This is a bullish signal, which indicates that Infosys is likely to breach ₹759 and rise to ₹770 and ₹775 again. Inability to break above ₹775 can drag the stock lower to ₹755 and ₹750 again. Such a pull-back move will keep the broader ₹695-775 sideways range intact. The stock has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time since mid-January this year. On the other hand, if Infosys manages to surpass ₹775 decisively, it will gain fresh momentum and target ₹795 and ₹800 thereafter.
 
RIL (₹1,279.2)
As expected, RIL declined below the psychological level of ₹1,300. The stock was down about 3 per cent last week and closed decisively below the 21-week moving average level of ₹1,309. The level of ₹1,300 will now act as a strong support-turned-resistance and cap the upside. As long as the stock trades below ₹1,300, the outlook will remain negative. RIL has to rise past ₹1,300 decisively to negate the bearish view and rise to ₹1,320 and ₹1,350 levels again. 










But such a strong up-move looks unlikely now. As such, a fall to ₹1,240 can be seen in the near term. If the RIL stock manages to bounce from ₹1,240, a relief rally to ₹1,300 is possible. But a break below ₹1,240 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹1,220 and ₹1,200. The region between ₹1,220 and ₹1,200 is a strong long-term support for the stock. A further fall below ₹1,200 looks unlikely as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at those levels. A strong bounce from ₹1,200 may indicate the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend for the stock.
 
Tata Steel (₹497.75)
Tata Steel tumbled over 7 per cent intraweek, but managed to bounce-back, recovering almost all the loss. The near-term outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹492 and resistance at ₹506. A breakout on either side of ₹492 or ₹506 will decide the direction of the next move. 










A break above ₹506 will ease the downside pressure. Such a break will take the stock higher to ₹515 and ₹520. The region around ₹520 is a crucial long-term resistance, which has to be breached decisively to turn the outlook bullish. A break above ₹520 can take Tata Steel up to ₹530. But if the stock breaks below ₹492, it can fall initially to ₹475. A further break below ₹475 will then increase the likelihood of the stock revisiting ₹465-460 levels. Tata Steel can trade in a wide range of ₹460-520 in the coming weeks. A breakout on either side of ₹460 or ₹520 will set the direction of the next move.

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) on Tuesday went past Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to become the most-valued firm in terms of market valuation.
RIL’s market capitalisation (m-cap) was at Rs 8,11,048.27 crore at the close of trade, which was Rs 11,246.23 crore more than that of Tata Consultancy Services’ (TCS) Rs 7,99,802.04 crore valuation on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
Shares of RIL settled at Rs 1,279.45, up 2.20 per cent on the BSE. Intra-day, it rose 2.55 per cent to Rs 1,283.85.

It was a muted June 2019 quarter for Reliance Industries (RIL) with consolidated net profit growing just about 7 per cent y-o-y to Rs 10,104 crore. And this growth too, was thanks largely to the push provided by the new-age consumer facing business – retail and digital. The profit of the company’s standalone business – that does not include retail and digital – grew only 2.4 per cent y-o-y to Rs 9,036 crore. Also, this small increase in standalone profit was thanks to lower tax cost – the company’s standalone profit before tax was down 1.7 per cent y-o-y. On a sequential quarter comparison basis, even the consolidated net profit was down about 2.5 per cent.
Both the core hydrocarbon-based segments – refining and petrochemicals – were on the back-foot due to a tough operating environment. This included slow global economic growth that dented demand and new global supplies that put pressure on product margins. The gross refining margin (GRM) in the June 2019 quarter fell to $8.1 a barrel from $10.5 in the year-ago period - this translated into a dip of nearly 15 per cent y-o-y in the segment’s operating profit despite volume-aided growth in revenue. The petrochemicals segment too struggled with a 4.4 y-o-y dip in operating profit – hit by both lower volumes and fall in price realization in some products. The oil and gas exploration business saw some decline in losses despite continued dip in volumes — the segment’s contribution though has become marginal over the years.
While the hydrocarbon businesses did badly, consumer-facing businesses perked up the overall performance and saved the day for RIL. Operating profit in the organised retail business was up about 66 per cent y-o-y – this was aided by store expansion in smaller cities that translated into 47 per cent growth in the segment’s revenue. The planned launch of its e-commerce platform is expected to give further heft to the retail business.
The digital services business segment that includes the telecom operations was the best performer for the company - the segment’s operating profit grew nearly 80 per cent on the back of 55 per cent growth in segment revenue. Continued subscriber additions have seen RJio move up to become the second-largest telecom operator in the country replacing Bharti Airtel. RJio’s net profit in the quarter rose nearly 46 per cent y-o-y to Rs 891 crore. The proposed Rs 25,000 crore deal with Brookfield for the tower unit should arm RJio with more financial muscle to fund its expansion plans including the roll-out of its broadband business and 5G bidding.
The consumer-facing segments have been steadily increasing their share of overall profits in line with the company’s plan of their achieving an equal footing with the hydrocarbon business. In the June 2019 quarter, the consumer-facing segments contributed 32 per cent of the consolidated segment EBITDA. This hedged business model approach has stood RIL in good stead in what has been a difficult quarter for the core hydrocarbon business. Value-unlocking, when it happens by the listing of the retail and digital businesses, can provide a good uptick to the RIL stock."

Mukesh Ambani, Chairman, RIL




Mukesh Ambani, Chairman, RIL


 Richest Indian Mukesh Ambani has kept his annual salary from his flagship firm Reliance Industries capped at Rs 15 crore for the eleventh year on the trot.
Ambani has kept his salary, perquisites, allowances and commission together at Rs 15 crore since 2008-09, forgoing over Rs 24 crore per annum. This is at a time when remunerations of all whole-time directors of the company, including cousins Nikhil and Hital Meswani, saw a handsome increase in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
“Compensation of Shri Mukesh D Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, has been set at Rs 15 crore, reflecting his desire to continue to set a personal example for moderation in managerial compensation levels,” RIL said in its latest annual report.
His remuneration for 2018-19 included Rs 4.45 crore as salary and allowances, which is marginally lower than Rs 4.49 crore he got in the previous 2017-18 fiscal.
Commission has been unchanged at Rs 9.53 crore, while perquisites have risen to Rs 31 lakh from Rs 27 lakh. Retirement benefits were Rs 71 lakh.
Ambani voluntarily capped his compensation at Rs 15 crore in October 2009 amid a debate over right-sizing of CEO salaries. The salary cap continued even as all other executive directors saw their remunerations go up.
Ambani’s cousins Nikhil R Meswani and Hital R Meswani saw their compensation rise to Rs 20.57 crore each. They earned Rs 19.99 crore each in 2017-18 and Rs 16.58 crore in 2016-17. In 2015-16, Nikhil got Rs 14.42 crore, while Hital took home Rs 14.41 crore. In 2014-15, they got Rs 12.03 crore each.
 Also, one of his key executives, Executive Director, P. M. S. Prasad saw his remuneration go up to Rs 10.01 crore from Rs 8.99 crore in the previous year. He, too, has seen his remuneration rise steadily -- from Rs 6.03 crore in 2014-15, to Rs 7.23 crore in the next fiscal and Rs 7.87 crore in 2016-17.
 Refinery chief Pawan Kumar Kapil saw his compensation rise to Rs 4.17 crore from Rs 3.47 crore in 2017-18. In the previous fiscal, his remuneration had fallen to Rs 2.54 crore, from Rs 2.94 crore in 2015-16. He had earned Rs 2.41 crore in 2014-15. The two, however, did not get any commission in 2018-19.
“Performance criteria for two Executive Directors, entitled for Performance Linked Incentive (PLI), are determined by the Human Resources, Nomination and Remuneration Committee,” RIL said in the annual report.
RIL’s non-executive directors, including Nita Ambani, also got Rs 1.65 crore each as commission, besides sitting fees. The commission was Rs 1.5 crore in 2017-18 and Rs 1.3 crore in the previous year.
Former State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya got only Rs 75 lakh as commission as she was appointed to the board of RIL only with effect from October 17, 2018.
Ambani’s wife Nita Ambani, a non-executive director on the company’s board, earned Rs 7 lakh as sitting fee, up from Rs 6 lakh in the previous year.
Apart from Ambani, the RIL board has Meswani brothers, Prasad and Kapil as whole-time directors.
Besides Nita Ambani, other non-executive directors include Mansingh L Bhakta, Yogendra P Trivedi, Dipak C Jain, Raghunath A Mashelkar, Adil Zainulbhai, Raminder Singh Gujral, Shumeet Banerji and Aruundhati Bhattacharya."
89,2019-07-21,Reliance,"A Peek Within: RIL - Muted performance 
 
It was a muted June 2019 quarter for Reliance Industries (RIL) with consolidated profit growing just 7 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹10,104 crore. This growth too was thanks to the consumer-facing business that offset weakness in the core hydrocarbon segments.
Slow global growth that dented demand and new supplies that squeezed product margins took a toll on the hydrocarbon segments. The gross refining margin in the quarter fell to $8.1 a barrel from $10.5 in the year-ago period. Lower volumes and realisations saw the petchem segment’s profit fall about 4 per cent Y-o-Y.
 










 
But consumer-facing businesses saved the day for RIL. Operating profit in the retail business was up 66 per cent Y-o-Y, thanks to store expansion in smaller cities. The operating profit of the digital services business, that includes RJio, grew nearly 80 per cent, aided by subscriber additions.
Value-unlocking, when it happens by the listing of the consumer businesses, can provide a good uptick to the RIL stock."

Motilal Oswal 
RIL (Neutral)
CMP: ₹1,280.5
Target: ₹1,400
Capex intensity remains high with total investment of ₹22,600 crore in 1QFY20, of which Jio accounted for ₹8,500 crore, RIL standalone for ₹6,000 crore and retail for ₹2,000 crore. There is no specific guidance on capex going forward. The petcoke gasifiers appear to have been fully commissioned, which should reduce capex, at least in the standalone business.
 SG refining margins have been recovering over the past few weeks, primarily due to large shutdowns that are being taken globally — either unplanned or to align production with IMO 2020. As these refineries come on stream, SG refining margins will likely stabilise at $6/bbl over the medium term, in our view.
Petrochem margins are expected to be weak in light of the expected expansions. Incremental capacity addition in 2019 is expected to be more than that in 2017 and 2018 combined, against which there is no commensurate demand.
We value RIL using SOTP. Core segment of refining and petrochem is valued at 7.5x FY21E EV/EBITDA. Peers trade at ~6.0x FY20E EV/EBITDA. RIL's premium is due to its ability to optimize crude basket, product yield, risk management and multiple feedstock availability for its petrochem segment.
We reiterate our Neutral stand on the company with a target price of ₹1,400, which leaves limited upside from the current levels."
87,2019-07-24,Reliance,"Communications panel okays ₹3,050-cr penalty imposed on Airtel, Voda-Idea
The Digital Communications Commission (DCC) on Wednesday approved the penalty imposed on Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea amounting to ₹3,050 crore (cumulative) for not providing points of interconnection to Reliance Jio. 
The decision comes after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) recently maintained its stand that t is not in a position to modify its previously recommended penalty on the operators as it is bound by the provisions of the TRAI Act.
“The DCC has accepted TRAI’s recommendation on penalty on Airtel and Vodafone Idea. It will send the same recommendation to the competent authority in the government for its decision,” Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary, Department of Telecom (DoT), told reporters here.
In October 2016, TRAI had recommended imposing a total penalty of ₹3,050 crore on Airtel, Vodafone and Idea (now merged) for allegedly denying inter-connectivity to Reliance Jio.
The DCC, the apex decision-making body of DoT, last month approved imposing a penalty on both the operators for not providing points of interconnection to Reliance Jio. But, before imposing the penalty, the Commission decided to seek TRAI’s views on revising the ₹3,050-crore suggested penalty, citing the ‘present financial health of the sector’.
Reacting to the latest development, both Airtel and Vodafone Idea said that they were disappointed with the decision to impose penalty. 
“This is despite the fact that the total number of POIs (points of interconnection) provided were more than sufficient for the projections provided on the number of customers. Further, the requested POIs were provided within the prescribed time limits and were more than the numbers requested for. All these facts were presented to the authorities. It is, therefore, disheartening that those facts have not been considered while taking this arbitrary decision of imposing the penalty,” an Airtel spokesperson said. 
Given the recent forced consolidation due to the financial stress that the sector is going through, this decision will impose an additional burden on the already stretched balance sheets of the operators, and will adversely impact the government’s vision of a digitally inclusive and empowered India, he said. 
“Upon receipt of the formal communication intimating the levy of penalty, we will approach the appropriate forum. We have complete faith in the judicial process and the law of the land,” he added."

Reliance Jio Infocomm won more subscribers to become India’s biggest telecom operator, as companies prepare for the planned rollout of a 5G network next year.
Reliance Jio’s subscriber base grew to 331.3 million in the quarter ended June, the company reported last week. That’s higher than nearest rival Vodafone Idea Ltd., which on Friday said its users fell to 320 million from 334.1 million last quarter.
Launched three years ago, RJio’s rapid growth has been fuelled by more than $36 billion in spending. Deep pockets helped the company lead intense competition that has driven India’s data tariffs to the lowest in the world. Bruised by the price war, firms have either been forced to shut down or combine with other players, such as the local unit of Vodafone Group Plc that merged with Idea Cellular Ltd.
Reliance Jio ranked second 2 in May, when its market share increased to 27.8 percent, according to data released by the industry regulator TRAI. Vodafone Ideas market share was 33.4% and Bharti Airtel Ltd. had 27.6% of the wireless market.
Most of Asia’s largest wireless carriers are in the process of testing 5G networks, with plans to introduce them commercially in 2020."
85,2019-07-27,Reliance,"Weekly Trading Guide 
SBI (₹342.5)
SBI tumbled 3.8 per cent last week, breaking below the key support level of ₹350. The next support near ₹335 is holding well as of now. As long as SBI sustains above this support, a corrective rally to ₹350 is possible in the near term. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹350 are needed to ease the downside pressure and bring back the bullish sentiment. But a rally beyond ₹350 looks less probable now as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels. A pull-back from ₹350 can drag the stock lower to ₹335 again. An eventual break below the key base level of ₹335 will then increase the likelihood of the downtrend resuming and declining to ₹328. The level of ₹328 is a strong support where both the 21-week moving average as well as a trend-line support are poised. As such the current down-move can halt around ₹328 and a bounce to ₹335-340 is possible from there. But if SBI declines below ₹328, the down-move can extend to ₹320 in the ensuing weeks.










ITC (₹270.3)
ITC fell over a per cent in the initial part of the week, but managed to bounce thereafter. The stock made a low of ₹264.4 and reversed higher recovering all the loss. The 200-week moving average support is holding well as of now. However, a key resistance is at ₹273 (21-day moving average) which has to be breached to get a breather. A strong break above ₹273 can trigger a corrective rally to ₹278 and ₹282. The region between ₹282 and ₹285 is a strong resistance which is likely to cap the upside. A rise past ₹285 looks unlikely at the moment. On the other hand, if ITC fails to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹273 in the coming days, it can dip to test ₹263 again. A sideways consolidation between ₹263 and ₹273 is possible for some time. The bias will remain bearish. An eventual break below ₹263 can take the stock initially lower to ₹257. A further break below ₹257 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹245 – a strong long-term support.
 






Infosys (₹787.3)
Infosys rose last week to test ₹800 as expected, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹804.25 and oscillated between ₹782 and ₹805 all through the week. The near-term outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹780 and resistance at ₹800. The stock can trade sideways between ₹780 and ₹800 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹780 or ₹800 will then determine the direction of the next move. A break below ₹780 can trigger profit-booking and drag the stock lower to ₹765. A cluster of supports is poised in the band between ₹765 and ₹750. So the downside could be limited to ₹750 if the stock declines below ₹780. On the other hand, if Infosys manages to sustain above ₹780, the bias will remain positive. It will keep the possibility high of the stock breaking above ₹800. Such a break above ₹800 will give a fresh boost to the stock. It will also indicate the resumption of the uptrend and take the stock up to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks.










RIL (₹1,214.1)
RIL tumbled 2.8 per cent, breaking below the crucial support level of ₹1,250. The price action over the last month indicates that the stock has been lacking strong buyers to take it above ₹1,300. This coupled with the sharp fall below ₹1,250 gives an initial sign of the long-term uptrend getting reversed. A further fall below the psychological level of ₹1,200 will confirm the same. Such a fall will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹1,130-1,120 in the coming weeks. The move below ₹1,200 could be sharp and swift as it could trigger strong profit-booking. But, if RIL manages to sustain above ₹1,200, a bounce to ₹1,250 is possible. In such a scenario, a sideways move in the ₹1,200-1,250 band can be seen for some time. RIL has to rise past ₹1,250 decisively to ease the downside pressure. A rise to ₹1,300 is possible on a break above ₹1,250. But such a strong up-move looks unlikely at the moment as fresh sellers are likely to emerge around ₹1,250 levels and cap the upside. 










Tata Steel (₹445.2)
Tata Steel extended its fall and kept the downtrend intact. The stock was down 2.8 per cent last week. An immediate resistance is in the ₹448-450 region and the next significant one is at ₹470, which can cap the upside. A rise past ₹470 looks unlikely. Tata Steel is likely to tumble towards ₹400 in the coming weeks. The region around ₹400 is a key support. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement support is also poised around ₹400. As such, the current fall can halt at ₹400. A corrective rally to ₹450 is possible if Tata Steel manages to bounce from ₹400. But the upside of this corrective rally is likely to be capped at ₹450. But if the stock fails to bounce from ₹400 and falls further, the downside pressure will increase. The break below ₹400 will see the stock tumbling to ₹350 or lower over the medium term.

Reliance agreed to buy a controlling stake in Shopsense Retail, which operates the Fynd platform.


 Reliance Industries agreed to buy a stake Shopsense Retail Technologies Pvt, technology start-up funded by Google, scooping up an inventory-management platform and adding to the list of smaller deals the conglomerate has assembled to take on Amazon.
The Mukesh Ambani’s group agreed to buy a controlling stake in Shopsense Retail, which operates the Fynd platform, according to a statement dated August 2. The investment unit of Reliance will pay as much as ₹2.95 billion in cash, with an option to plow in a further ₹1 billion. Once completed by December 2021, the total investment would translate to an 87.6 per cent stake, the company said.
Reliance is adding Fynd as part of its focus on consumer businesses and mobile phone services as growth areas for the sprawling energy-to-retail conglomerate. India’s largest retailer has said it intends to transform itself from a grocery and neighbourhood store-based empire to an online powerhouse as India becomes a battleground for giants such as Amazon Inc. and Walmart’s Flipkart Online Services Pvt.
Shopsense, which started out as an online fashion portal, has attracted investments from Alphabet Inc’s Google, among others, and has shifted its focus to helping stores boost sales by managing inventory. Ambani has said the key to his e-commerce push will be empowering mom-and-pop retailers with technology to improve their sales and better serve customers.
The deal for Fynd will enable the groups digital and new commerce initiatives, according to the statement. The transaction doesn’t require regulatory approval, the company said. Fynd, which was incorporated about seven years ago, had a ₹186.4 million net loss in fiscal 2018 on sales of ₹48.4 million, according to the statement."

SBI (₹291.3)
SBI continued the fall for the fifth consecutive week. The stock tumbled 5.5 per cent last week. With this fall, the stock has plummeted 21.4 per cent over the last five weeks. On the charts, there is room for the fall to extend further in the coming days. The levels of ₹304 and ₹307 are the key near-term resistances which can cap the upside. There is possibility of a sideways consolidation between ₹285 and ₹307 (200-day moving average) in the near term. But a strong rise past ₹307 looks less likely now as the broader bias continues to remain negative. As such, SBI is likely to decline eventually below ₹285 and extend the current downtrend to ₹275-273 or even ₹269. The broad region between ₹275 and ₹269 is a strong support zone, which can halt the current fall. A corrective rally to ₹290-300 is possible from this support zone on short-covering. But if SBI declines below ₹269, it will come under more pressure. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹245-240 or even ₹230.










ITC (₹254.2)
ITC fell about 4 per cent last week breaking below the support level of ₹263 (200-week moving average) as expected. The downtrend remains intact. However, ITC is coming closer to an intermediate support level of ₹250. If it manages to bounce from this support, a corrective up-move to ₹260 or ₹265 is possible. ITC may, thus, remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. However, a strong rally beyond ₹265 looks unlikely. An eventual break below ₹250 will see the stock resuming the downtrend to ₹240 — possibly the last leg of move in the current downtrend. The level of ₹240 is a strong long-term trend support, which can halt the current downtrend. A strong bounce from ₹240 can take the stock up to ₹260-265. There is possibility of the stock forming a base by consolidating between ₹240 and ₹265. A decisive break above ₹265 can start a fresh rally, targeting ₹290-300 over the medium term. But if ITC declines below ₹240, the fall can extend to ₹230-228 band.










Infosys (₹790.1)
Infosys has remained stuck between ₹755 and ₹805 over the last four weeks. Within this range, the stock rose about 2 per cent last week. The near-term outlook continues to remain unclear. The up-move in the past week looks weak. This reduces the possibility l of the stock breaking above ₹805 — the upper end of the range at the moment. The stock can reverse lower again towards ₹765 and ₹755 and maintain the sideways move t for some more time. A breakout on either side of ₹755 or ₹805 will determine the direction of the next move. If Infosys manages to break above ₹805, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break will indicate the resumption of the broader uptrend. It will then take the stock up to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if Infosys breaks the range below ₹755, it can come under pressure. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹740. A further break below ₹740 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending towards ₹715 and ₹700 on profit-booking.










RIL (₹1,162.0)
RIL tumbled over 7 per cent intra-week to a low of ₹1,095.65. However, the stock has managed to claw-back sharply from the low. But this bounce-back is just a short-covering rally which may not last long. A further rise to test the immediate resistance level of ₹1,190 is possible in the near term. A break above ₹1,190 will extend the corrective rally to ₹1,220. However, a further rise past ₹1,220 is less likely as fresh sellers can emerge at higher levels. Also, the indicators on the charts are bearish. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average. This is a bearish signal, indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, RIL is likely to reverse lower either from ₹1,190 or ₹1,220. It will then take the stock lower to ₹1,100-1,090 levels again. Inability to break below ₹1,090 can keep the stock sideways between ₹1,090 and ₹1,220 for some time. But the bias will continue to remain negative and RIL is likely to decline below ₹1,090 eventually. Such a break will then drag the stock lower to ₹1,050 and ₹1,030










Tata Steel (₹362.3)
Tata Steel is on a free fall and has declined to ₹360 as expected. The stock tumbled 11.4 per cent last week. Tata Steel has plummeted over 28 per cent in the last six weeks. An immediate support is at ₹358. If Tata Steel manages to bounce from this support, a corrective rally to ₹385 or ₹400 is possible on short-covering. A rise past ₹400 is unlikely now as fresh sellers can emerge at higher levels and keep the broader downtrend intact. As such, an eventual break below ₹358 will see the current fall extending to ₹330 and ₹325. As cautioned last week, from a long-term perspective, the current downtrend which had begun in 2018 is looking strong. This downtrend may have the potential to drag Tata Steel to ₹250-230. An intermediate halt and a corrective bounce is possible from the ₹310-300 support zone before the targets of ₹250-230 are achieved.

BL Research Bureau
Reliance Industries (RIL) decision to sell a 20 per cent stake in its refining and petrochemicals business to Saudi Aramco at an enterprise value of $75 billion has many positives for the Indian behemoth.
One, it could help the company pare its debt, that has risen significantly in recent years. The deal should fetch RIL about $15 billion; this should help the company deleverage significantly and also aid in its expansion plans across businesses. A recent Credit Suisse report had raised some concerns about RIL’s debt levels. The brokerage had said that RIL’s financing liabilities had increased from $19 billion in FY 2015 to $65 billion in FY 2019, while its net debt had risen from $2.7 billion to $12.4 billion in this period and additional debt at the consolidated balance sheet rose from $9.4 billion to $20.6 billion. This had led to an increase in interest cost for the company from has risen $1.2 billion in FY 2015 to $4 billion in FY19 (including both reported and capitalised interest cost). To be sure, much of this increase in debt was to finance business expansion – in both the core hydrocarbon businesses (refining and petrochemicals) and the aggressive rollout of the new-age consumer-facing businesses – digital including RJio and retail, that have helped the company grow profits sharply. Seen in conjunction with the recent deals with Brookfield for the tower business and with BP in the fuel retailing business, this latest deal with Saudi Aramco should position RIL well. It should lead to sharp cuts in debt levels and also give the company additional firepower to continue its expansion drive, especially in the telecom business where the auction for 5G waves is on the anvil.

Next, it will further bolster RIL’s formidable crude sourcing capabilities that have traditionally given it an edge over many other competitors and aided its gross refining margin (GRM) - the difference between the price of the petroleum product slate and the cost of crude oil. Reports say that Saudi Aramco, among the largest oil producers in the world, will supply 500,000 barrels per day, or 25 million tonnes per annum, of crude oil to RIL’s twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat. Not just the added security of supply, the deal could also bring RIL pricing advantages given that a key supplier will now also be an investor in the business. This will also have a positive knock-on effect on the petrochemicals business, which has crude oil as the main raw material. It will also, to an extent, cushion RIL from the uncertainties in the global crude oil market due to the US – Iran tensions.
Besides, this stake sale should help RIL accelerate its move towards increasing the share of the consumer businesses in the overall profit pie. The company has a plan of the consumer businesses achieving an equal footing with the hydrocarbon business, and they have been steadily increasing their share over the past few years. In the June 2019 quarter, the consumer-facing segments contributed 32 per cent of the consolidated segment EBITDA. This hedged business model approach has stood RIL in good stead. For instance, in what was a difficult June 2019 quarter for the core hydrocarbon business, the retail and digital businesses saved the day for RIL. The move helps RIL reduce its dependence on the hydrocarbon business, at a time when globally, and including India, the move towards electric vehicles (EVs) is picking pace.
The market, when it opens tomorrow, is likely to react positively to this stake sale move by RIL. Besides, value-unlocking, when it happens by the listing of the retail and digital businesses, can provide a good uptick to the RIL stock.
For Saudi Aramco, the 20 per cent stake buy in one of the world’s largest refining and petrochemicals businesses gives it a much sought after foothold in India – the third-largest consumer of crude oil in the world."

   -  Paul Noronha


Though it was the shareholders’ meeting with arguably the most number of big ticket announcements, the offer to give bundled television sets and simultaneous movie releases on its digital platform caught investors’ fancy at Reliance Industries’ 42nd annual general meeting here on Monday.
The response to the slew of consumer-centric announcements was a higher than to the assurances of “abundantly” rewarding shareholders through higher dividends and periodic bonuses, usually the most keenly tracked aspects at any AGMs.
In his nearly two-hour-long speech in the packed Birla Matoshri hall in south Mumbai, Chairman Mukesh Ambani spoke on a variety of initiatives, including tie-ups with two companies, wherein the partners are valued at over $1 trillion each.
The first is a 20 per cent stake buy by Saudi Aramco– the world’s largest company if listed today as it owns nearly fifth of the world’s oil reserves– in RIL’s oil and chemicals assets for $15 billion.
The second is an exclusive partnership with the global tech giant Microsoft on the cloud computing front to help local small businesses. There was also a $7000 crore investment into RIL fuel retailing by the British energy major BP. But none of them got the due attention from the shareholders.
While there were the frequent appreciative claps at every assertion and announcement by the Chairman, the one on to release films on same day on its digital platform and bundling in of TV sets received the highest response.
Not just the stadia-like hall, giant screens locked on the front row– members of the Ambani family and other key executives– showed in an eruption of joy at the ‘first day first show’ announcement.
A similar response was seen when Ambani announced free TV sets for its broadband users.
“Jiofiber customers who opt for our annual plans which we call Jioforeever plans, will get an HD or 4K LED television and a 4K set-top box absolutely free,” Ambani said, with a huge plasma displaying the “ABSOLUTELY FREE” in strikingly high font size.
In the question and answer session that followed the speech, there was some evidence of the investors’ skepticism, as some of them went public with their unhappiness on dividends being paid by the company.
In a departure from the last year’s AGM, when Ambani had desisted from making any reference to the government or its schemes ahead of the elections, the AGM was pregnant with such mentions.
He thanked Prime Minister Modi and Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammad bin Salman al Saud for blessing the deal where Aramco will be buying a fifth of its oil to chemicals business for $15 billion, and also mentioned about the re-elected PM’s aspiration to make the country a $5-trillion economy over the next five years."

 Mukesh Ambani struck the right political notes at the annual general meeting of Reliance Industries Ltd on Monday unlike some of his peers in the industry, who have blamed the government for the lacklustre performance of the Indian economy.
Backing the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call after the abrogation of Article 370, Ambani said Reliance “stand committed to support the people of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh in all their developmental needs”. “Reliance will create a special task force and you will see a lot of announcements on Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh and our developmental initiatives in the coming months,” he said.
Referring to the slow down in some sectors of the economy, he said it was only “temporary”. This was because “the fundamentals of the Indian economy are very strong and opportunities will grow further with structural reforms”. 
Besides, Ambani said now “India has political stability”.
The government, according to him, is laying the foundation of new institutions for business promotion and regulation.
“New long-term measures are being taken to improve ease of living for all citizens and reduce income inequality… India is rising and no power on earth can stop India from rising higher,” he said.
Borrowing a leaf out of Modi’s oft repeated words “New India”, Ambani said that “as India is getting transformed into New India, Reliance will also transform itself into New Reliance”.
Ambani “fully endorsed” Modi’s ambitious goal of making India a $5-trillion economy by 2024 and even went a step further by saying that he clearly saw “India becoming a $10-trillion economy by 2030, with every Indian as a beneficiary”."

Reliance Industries soared the most in more than two years after billionaire Mukesh Ambani revealed a plan to sell a stake to Aramco as part of efforts to pare debt that piled after racking up $76 billion in capital expenditure in the last five years.
The conglomerate aims to be a zero-net-debt company in 18 months, Asia’s richest man told shareholders Monday. Aiding that effort would be a proposed sale of 20% of Reliances oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Arabian Oil Co. at an enterprise value of $75 billion. The company will also start preparing to list its retail and telecommunications units within five years, Ambani said.
Shares of Reliance jumped as much as 8.8% in Mumbai, the biggest intra-day gain since Feb. 22, 2017.

The tycoon is cleaning up the groups finances following years of spending on his wireless carrier, whose entry in 2016 with free calls and cheap data upended the industry and spurred a consolidation. The $50 billion plowed into the phone venture, mostly in debt, has raised concerns among analysts including at Credit Suisse Group AG that Reliance’s ballooning borrowings could weigh on growth. Ambani sought to allay those fears.
With these initiatives, I have no doubt that your company will have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world, he said. We will also evaluate value unlocking options for our real estate and financial investments.
The Aramco deal should be completed by March and is subject to due diligence, definitive agreements and regulatory and other approvals, Ambani said. He didn’t say how the deal would be structured."

 Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Aramco) buying a 20 per cent stake in Reliance Industries’ oil-to-chemical business will help it regain the position of being the biggest supplier of oil to the world’s fastest-growing oil market.
Saudi Arabia, which traditionally has been India’s top oil source, lost the slot to Iraq during the last two financial years.
This will change with Aramco buying 20 per cent stake in RIL’s oil-to-chemical (O2C) business, which has an enterprise valuation of $75 billion as it will be accompanied with a deal to supply 500,000 barrels per day or 25 million tonnes a year of crude oil.
“Crude supplies of 500,000 b/d represents about 40 per cent of Reliance’s crude intake, significantly higher than the stake taken, although Saudi Aramco historically supplied 20 per cent of Reliance’s crude oil requirements,” said Alan Gelder, vice-president refining and chemicals at Wood Mackenzie.
Saudi Arabia in the 2018-19 fiscal exported 40.33 million tonnes of crude oil to India, over 15 per cent short of the 46.61 million tonnes sold by Iraq, according to data sourced from the Directorate-General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics.
Additional oil supplies following the Reliance deal will catapult Saudi Arabia to the top spot again.
The O2C business includes Reliance’s refining and petrochemical divisions, and its 51 per cent stake in its fuel marketing business. The remainder 49 per cent stake in the fuel marketing business, which comprises 1,400 petrol pumps and aviation fuel facilities at 31 airports, has been sold to BP for Rs 7,000 crore.
The terms of the deal are yet to be finalised, but Reliance, going by the enterprise value announced by its Chairman Mukesh Ambani on Monday, will get roughly $15 billion, including some debt adjustments, for the 20 per cent stake when the sale closes later this year.
Read also: RIL-Aramco deal: A win-win for Reliance Industries
Gelder said the deal is further evidence that Saudi Aramco is executing on its long-term strategy to increase its refining and petrochemical capacity.
Saudi Aramco continues to show a keen interest in accessing the Indian market, which has the strongest long-term growth prospects, he said.
Following the same strategy, it along with UAE’s ADNOC had signed up to take 50 per cent stake in a planned 60 million tonnes a year refinery on the west coast. Aramco and ADNOC are to supply half of the crude oil required for the proposed refinery that will come up not before 2025.
Saudi Arabia is keen to get a foothold in the world’s fastest-growing fuel market to get a captive customer for the crude oil it produces. Crude oil is the basic raw material for the manufacturing of petrochemicals.
Like other major producers, it is looking to lock in customers in the world’s third-largest oil consumer through the investment. Kuwait is also looking to invest in projects in return for getting an assured offtake of their crude oil.
Saudi Aramco is also keen on retailing fuel in India. A refinery in India can also be a base for it to export fuel to deficit countries in Europe and the Americas. India has a refining capacity of 247.6 million tonne, which exceeded the demand of 206.2 million tonne.
Reliance’s refining and petrochemicals assets include 1.2 million b/d of highly-sophisticated refining assets at Jamnagar in Gujarat. Both its refineries in Jamnagar are heavily integrated with petrochemicals.
The company also has a world-leading position in polyester and intermediates, as well as steam crackers and polyolefins capacity at another four locations in India.
“This strategy is being achieved through a combination of project and acquisitions, with this acquisition following on from last year’s acquisition of SABIC and SASREF, and the memorandum of understanding Aramco signed this year to acquire a 9 per cent stake in Zhejiang Petrochemical’s 800,000 b/d integrated refinery and petrochemical complex in Zhoushan, China,” he said."

Saudi Aramco’s proposed purchase of part of Reliance Industries Ltd will allow it to regain its grip on the world’s fastest-growing oil market, where suppliers including the US and Russia are making inroads.
Aramco’s plan to buy 20 per cent of the oil-to-chemicals business of Reliance — which includes the world’s biggest refining complex at Jamnagar — comes with an assurance to buy half a million barrels a day of the kingdom’s crude on a long-term basis. That is around 25 million tons a year and will allow Saudi Arabia to easily reclaim the top supplier spot from Iraq.
Asia has traditionally bought the bulk of its oil from West Asia, but thats changing as the US ramps up shale exports, Russia looks for new customers and Saudi Arabia leads OPEC efforts to curb production to prop up prices.

It is not only Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd that would gain from the proposed deal with Saudi Aramco, but the Saudi Arabian oil giant as well as the Indian consumers will benefit too. The deal, once formalised, will see a new combination coming into play in India’s petroleum retailing business — RIL plus Aramco in partnership with BP.
Earlier this month, BP and RIL had announced that they have agreed to form a new joint venture that will include a retail service station network and aviation fuel business across India. In the joint venture, 51 per cent will be held by RIL and 49 per cent by BP. The JV will assume ownership of RIL’s existing Indian fuel retail network and access its aviation fuel business.

Earlier this week, Ambani, at his company’s annual general meeting, announced that Saudi Aramco and Reliance have agreed to form a long-term partnership in oil to chemicals (O2C) division. Aramco will invest in Reliance for a 20 per cent stake in O2C at an enterprise value of $75 billion. The partnership will cover all of RIL’s refining and petrochemicals assets, including 51 per cent of the petroleum retail JV.
With this deal the play has slightly changed in India’s petroleum retail. It will be O2C (RIL plus Aramco) in joint venture with BP. Sources said, while talking with Aramco, RIL had kept BP informed as well.
According to sources in the know, the joint venture will now be formed between the proposed O2C and BP. The name of the JV is also yet to be worked out. The three players will work out the name of the retail brand.

The coming together of the giants in the petroleum retail business will open up a new identity to the segment in India which till now has been dominated by the public sector undertakings, said an industry tracker.
But, BP already has licences (for 3,500 outlets) to retail fuels and jet fuel in India, so why did it need RIL’s partnership? BP said, “The idea is to bring together the strengths of both partners. Building on Reliance’s existing Indian fuel retailing network and aviation fuel business, the partners expects the venture to expand rapidly to help meet the country’s fast-growing demand for energy and mobility.”
RIL and BP’s venture will incorporate and build on RIL’s current fuel retailing network of over 1,400 sites across India, which the partners aim to grow rapidly to up to 5,500 sites over the next five years. RIL’s aviation fuel business currently operates at over 30 airports across India, providing participation in this rapidly-growing market.
But what does it mean for Aramco? Vandana Hari, Founder and CEO of Vanda Insights, said, “The RIL stake purchase fits in well with Aramco’s strategy of diversifying internationally and downstream. The deal to supply the Jamnagar refinery with 500,000 barrels per day of crude gives Aramco an assured market on a long-term basis.”
“Further, if we take the view that OPEC capacity being surplus compared with demand for its oil is the new normal in the decades to come, that crude supply contract is especially desirable for Aramco,” she added.
Aramco also has ambitious plans to grow its international trading business. It may find synergies with RIL's product exports from Jamnagar. “The mega refinery (in India) is also a good fit but it's down the road. The RIL stake will be the one that counts when Aramco goes for its IPO,” she said."

   -  Bloomberg


 Fitch Ratings on Friday raised the outlook on Reliance Industries (RIL) to positive from stable due to the company’s potential to further deleverage following its announcement to eliminate its net debt by March 2021.
In a statement, Fitch said it is revising “the outlook on RIL’s Long-Term Local-Currency issuer default rating (IDR) to Positive from Stable and has affirmed the rating at ‘BBB’. At the same time, the agency has affirmed the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR at ‘BBB-’ with a Stable Outlook, as RIL’s Foreign-Currency IDR is capped by India’s (BBB-/Stable) Country Ceiling of ‘BBB-’.”
The revision in the outlook follows RIL announcing plans to sell a 20 per cent stake in its oil-to-chemical division to Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco). This provides RIL potential to “further deleverage” after eliminating its net debt by the financial year 2020-21.

“We forecast its adjusted net debt/EBITDAR to reach 1.5x over the next 18 to 24 months,” Fitch said. The rating affirmation reflected RIL’s strong business profile - a large-scale refinery with a capacity of around 1.2 million barrels a day and dominant market position in petrochemicals. “The company has completed capex to increase its downstream integration, which has improved feedstock flexibility,” the rating agency said adding it expects RIL’s digital-services business, Jio, to continue its strong growth.
Jio has achieved a leading position in its wireless subscriber base, though it is still evolving, as reflected in the recent spinoff of its tower and fibre assets to investment trusts and plans to roll out a fiber-to-the-home business."

 Morgan Stanley has re-rated the stock of Reliance Industries Ltd from ‘equal weight’ to ‘over-weight’ after its promoter Mukesh Ambani announced major decisions at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) held last week.
“In our view, as supply-side re-balancing helps refining markets improve, significant fall in costs of feedstock like ethane reduces challenges for RIL’s petrochemical division and downside risks ease in the aromatic value chain. RIL’s AGM announcement also provided a path to de-lever the balance sheet (debt/liabilities account for a third of RIL’s enterprise value). This should address investor concern about the balance sheet,” the Morgan Stanley research report said.
PTI adds
RIL’s faster asset monetisation, together with the rebalancing of oil refining market and cheaper feedstock, could help drive up the company’s price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, Morgan Stanley said in the report. Including RIL in its ‘Three in Three’ report for Asia-Pacific, the brokerage firm upgraded the company’s stock to ‘overweight’.
“RIL has corrected 12 per cent in three months as both refining and chemical industry margins hit cash cost (or operational cost),” Morgan Stanley said in the research report.
At close of trade on Monday, RIL’s market capitalisation (m-cap) stood at ₹8,19,073.62 crore, which is ₹7,226.43 crore more than that of Tata Consultancy Services’ ₹8,11,847.19 crore on the BSE. Shares of RIL rose by 1.15 per cent to close at ₹1,292.10 on the BSE, while those of TCS closed flat at ₹2,163.55. 
Since August 9, RIL shares have gone up by over 11 per cent.
RIL and TCS have in the past also competed with each other for the No 1 position in terms of market capitalisation.
 In the domestic m-cap ranking, RIL was at No 1 position followed by TCS, HDFC Bank (₹6,03,371.38 crore), HUL (₹3,94,145.32 crore) and HDFC (₹3,64,763.82 crore) in the top-five list."
71,2019-08-21,Reliance,"How a gas glut has taken the wind out of RIL’s $4-b bet 


A global glut in natural gas is threatening to undermine a $4 billion investment by Reliance Industries aimed at boosting profits at the worlds largest oil refining complex.
The project made all the sense in the world when energy magnate Mukesh Ambani’s conglomerate announced it in 2012: convert petroleum coke, or petcoke, one of the cheapest and dirtiest refinery by-products, into gas needed to power the massive Jamnagar complex on India’s west coast. Then it hit about three years of delays, and global gas markets crashed amid a growing supplies of liquefied cargoes from the US, Australia and Russia.
The 10 synthetic gasifiers that make up the project are now finally commissioned. But the imported LNG they are meant to displace has fallen from about $15 per million British thermal units in 2012 to less than $5. And that price slump has reduced the projects viability, according to a person with knowledge of the company’s finances.
Reliance predicted in 2014 that the project would boost Jamnagar’s refining margins by as much as $2 a barrel. Now, Mumbai-based Centrum Broking sees an uplift of about $1.30 to $1.50 a barrel by the 2021-2022 fiscal, according to a July 21 report by analysts Probal Sen and Akshay Mane.
It’s not the most conducive environment to bring the petcoke project on stream, said Somshankar Sinha, head of India equity research at Jefferies Financial Group. The LNG surplus has caused prices to fall much more than the usual decline in summer months, the Mumbai-based analyst added. Jefferies said it expects a full ramp-up of Reliance project in financial year 2021.
Project status
The gasifiers, originally scheduled to begin operations in 2016, are now in the final stages of being stabilised and integrated with other facilities, with an expected increase to full capacity in March, according to people with knowledge of operations, who asked not to be identified as information is not public.
Reliance has said the units are still profitable at current LNG prices and it will cut down on imports of the fuel when they come online. Whenever it comes, gasification will be cost-effective, Joint Chief Financial Officer V. Srikanth said in Mumbai last month.
With the plant still not fully operational, the company is still importing LNG, recently picking up several cargoes for delivery between July and October. Meanwhile, it has also been selling petcoke, according to a trader who distributes the product. Reliance spokesman Tushar Pania did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Refining returns
A recovery in LNG prices should aid economics for the gasifier, according to Centrum Broking, even as LNG prices are set to stay low due to surging supplies from US.
Based on the forward curve for Asia’s dominant LNG benchmark for supplies in Japan and South Korea, the super-chilled gas is priced at between $5.50 and $8 per million Btu from 2020 to 2023. Prompt LNG prices are pegged at around $4.70 per MMBtu.
Low LNG spot prices could encourage Reliance to take more spot volumes in the coming quarters, although the company wont shift its long-term strategy away from eliminating petcoke residue, said Senthil Kumaran, a Singapore-based analyst at industry consultant FGE.
The payoffs from Reliance investment in gasifiers, however, will not be as rich as it was originally thought, he added."

SBI can face resistance ahead
After taking a breather in the week earlier, SBI resumed its fall and tumbled 6.8 per cent last week. Though there is a possibility to see a near-term corrective bounce, the broader picture remains weak. A strong resistance at ₹280 can cap the rally. A consolidation between ₹260 and ₹280 for a week cannot be ruled out. The indicators on the charts remain bearish, keeping the doors open for further fall. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average — a bearish cross-over indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, SBI is likely to keep the downtrend intact and break below ₹260 in the coming days. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹250-245. A further break below ₹245 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹230. The broad region between ₹240 and ₹230 is a strong support zone which can halt the current downtrend. A corrective rally, thereafter, to ₹270-280 cannot be ruled out. But a strong break below ₹230 will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling further to ₹190-180 over the medium term.










ITC breaks crucial long-term support
ITC is under pressure. The stock plummeted 6.8 per cent last week. This sharp fall has dragged the stock well below the crucial long-term support level of ₹240. We will have to wait and see if ITC sustains below ₹240 and confirms the break. It has to reverse sharply higher and close decisively above ₹243 to get a breather. In such scenario, the chances of seeing a further fall will get reduced, and a corrective rally to ₹255 and ₹260 is possible. But an inability to bounce above ₹243 can take ITC lower to the next key support level of ₹228.5. If it manages to hold above this support, it can consolidate between ₹228 and ₹243 for some time. But as long as ITC trades below ₹243, it will remain under pressure. An eventual break below ₹228.5 will confirm the break of the long-term uptrend and intensify the fall further. Such a break will see the stock tumbling further towards the next major support levels of ₹211 and ₹207. It will also keep the possibilities high of the stock extending the fall even up to ₹200 and ₹190.










Infosys to remain range-bound
Infosys broke the ₹755-805 range on the upside last week, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹809.95 and came off slightly from there to close just below the upper end of the ₹755-805 range. The stock was up 3.5 per cent last week. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹805 are needed to confirm the range breakout. A key support is at ₹789. As long as Infosys remains above this support, there is a strong likelihood of the stock breaking the range above ₹805. Such a break will boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks. But if the stock remains below ₹805, a narrow range-bound move between ₹789 and ₹805 is possible in the near term. A break below ₹789 will reduce the chances of the stock breaching ₹805. Such a break will see an initial dip to ₹785. A further break below ₹785 will then strengthen the downmove and drag the stock lower to ₹768 and ₹763. In that case, the ₹755-805 range will continue to remain intact.










 
Near-term outlook is unclear for RIL
RIL fell sharply by 4 per cent intra-week to make a low of ₹1,226.8. However, it managed to claw back on Friday, recovering all the loss. RIL has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹1,225 and ₹1,304 over the past couple of weeks. This leaves the near-term outlook mixed. As mentioned last week, RIL can consolidate sideways between ₹1,215 and ₹1,305. A breakout on either side of ₹1,215 or ₹1,305 will determine the direction of the next move. Though the strong bounce on Friday keeps the bias positive, weakness in the broader markets may play spoil sport. As such, the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,215 in the coming days cannot be ruled out. Such a break will bring renewed pressure on the stock and increase the chances of it revisiting ₹1,150 and ₹1,100 levels in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if RIL breaks above ₹1,305 decisively, it will gain fresh momentum. In such a scenario, the stock can surge to ₹1,400. An eventual break above ₹1,400 will then pave way for a further rally to ₹1,480 over the medium term.










The downtrend remains intact in Tata Steel. The stock tumbled 5 per cent last week. It has plummeted over 30 per cent over the last eight weeks. The support in the ₹330-320 zone mentioned last week is holding well as of now. But the indicators on the charts are bearish. The 21-week moving average is on the verge of crossing below the 200-week moving average. This is a negative signal indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, it can continue to remain under pressure and any intermediate bounce could be short-lived. An immediate resistance is in the ₹353-355 region which can cap the upside in the near term and keep the stock under pressure. An eventual break below ₹320 will see the fall extending to ₹300 and even lower going forward. Also, as being reiterated in this column over the past few weeks, the current downtrend — which has been in place since 2018 — looks strong. It has the potential to drag Tata Steel lower to ₹250-230 in the coming months.

69,2019-08-27,Reliance,"Reliance Jio Infocomm becomes market leader on ‘AGR’ basis




Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio), a subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries (RIL), has reported a marketshare in terms of 31.7 per cent Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) for the quarter ended June 30. 
In June, RJio had emerged as the largest operator with a subscriber base of 331 million. 
Bharti Airtel ranked second with a 30 per cent marketshare, followed by Vodafone Idea with a 28.1 per cent share, according to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) data.
“RJio’s AGR (including National Long Distance) rose 9 per cent YoY to ₹10,900 crore, and finally became the number one operator,” said brokerage firm ICICI Securities, which analysed the data.
It added, “RJio’s AGR grew strong at 12.3 per cent in A circles and in metros grew 5.1 per cent. AGR growth in B and C circles was 8.6 per cent and 9.8 per cent, respectively. Its ARPU (based on AGR) rose 0.2 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis to ₹114.” 
In comparison, RJio’s AGR was at 31.6 per cent in the previous fourth quarter and 22.4 per cent in the comparable previous year-ago quarter. AGR is defined as gross revenue minus access and pass-through charges. ARPU, or Average Revenue Per User, is a financial metric for a telecom firm.
Bharti Airtel’s AGR (including NLD) stood at ₹10,300 crore during the quarter under review. 
The New Delhi-based company had posted a 27.2 per cent market share in the fourth quarter of FY19, and 31.7 per cent in the comparable year-ago quarter. “Bharti is gaining higher incremental market share in its traditionally weaker 1,800 MHz circles where revenue AGR grew 17.9 per cent YoY to ₹2,400 crore. These were leadership circles of Vodafone and Idea Cellular. Bharti’s AGR grew 8.1 per cent in its traditional 900MHz leadership circles,” said the brokerage firm.
Vodafone Idea’s AGR stood at ₹9,600 crore. The company posted a 28.1 per cent AGR market share in the first quarter of this fiscal, compared with 34.7 per cent in the year-ago period. 
It posted an AGR market share of 32.1 per cent in fourth quarter of last financial year."

India’s three big wireless carriers have been locked in a brutal price war, leading to mounting debts for the companies and declines in subscribers for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea.
   -  Bloomberg


 
The wireless carrier controlled by Reliance Industries’ arm (RIL) will probably keep drawing users away from rivals, reaching a market share of as much as 45 per cent by fiscal year 2022, from 30 per cent as of March, a unit of Fitch Group said.
Reliance Jio Infocomm, which has been offering data tariffs that are as much as 30 per cent lower than competitors, is in a position to take advantage of intensifying competition, the unit, India Ratings and Research, said Thursday in its mid-year outlook for telecommunications.
India’s three big wireless carriers have been locked in a brutal price war, leading to mounting debts for the companies and declines in subscribers for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. The companies elevated debt levels and reliance on capital infusions for debt servicing and expenditures prompted India Ratings to maintain its negative outlook for the industry, it said in the report.
RIL stormed into the industry in 2016 and has bet his carrier can outlast rivals while offering some of the lowest prices for services and handsets.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone idea will probably see their slice of the market drop to between 25 per cent and 27 per cent, according to the outlook, India Ratings predicted.
India has said it may seek to raise $84 billion from a sale of airwaves, including some to be used for 5G services. Plans for the auction have raised concern that carriers will have to borrow even more to pay for building the new network. Any incremental capital expenditure toward spectrum or 5G technology will derail the fragile recovery and be negative for ratings, according to the India Ratings report by Prashant Tarwadi, a director."

Setting the agenda for future opportunities in the New India, Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of the Board of Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU), stated that riding on the digital transformation, the country is standing at the threshold of a historic opportunity.
Addressing the 7th Convocation of the University in Gandhinagar on Thursday, Ambani expressed confidence on the transformative power of digitisation at play in India. He said that in the last 24-36 months, India has jumped to the top from the 155th position in terms of mobile data consumption globally.
“India's digital transformation, driven by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Digital India programme, is unmatched and unprecedented...In the next 24 months, India will similarly be among the leading nations in the world in the adoption of Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Blockchain, Cloud computing and other technologies of the 4th industrial revolution,” he said.
The chairman of India’s largest industrial conglomerate - Reliance Industries Limited, Ambani underlined that the 4th industrial revolution will essentially work towards doubling the income of farmers and enriching small traders and entrepreneurs.
India will use these technologies to make villages and cities smarter and to becoming a leading digital society in the world. “This is the new India I would like all of you to prepare yourself for,” he told the graduating students.
Union Home Minister Amit Shah was the chief guest of the Convocation. In his convocation address, Shah stated that the Government would give PDPU ₹100 crore for a National Institute of Excellence and ₹50 crore each for a startup incubation centre and an advanced energy research centre on its campus.
He said, “Today India’s macro-economic indicators are strong even as it remains the fastest growing economy in the world. The growth rate of India is currently above 7 per cent and by 2022, it will be among top three economies in the world. It needs to achieve eight per cent growth if it seeks to be a 5 trillion dollar economy. India is moving ahead to achieve this goal with micro-plannning.”
Also present were Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Chief Secretary J N Singh and State Cabinet ministers."
66,2019-09-02,Reliance,"The metamorphosis of Reliance Industries
Stock charts often reveal the stories and journeys of companies. Sure enough, the chart of market behemoth Reliance Industries (RIL) over the past decade tells many a tale. From mid-2009 to early 2017 — nearly seven-and-a-half years — the RIL stock moved in and around a narrow range of ₹350-550 (adjusted for bonus issues).
Investors were understandably glum about this long hibernation, given the company’s reputation of rewarding shareholders. But then, the stock broke out — more than doubling over the past two-and-half years. Its moves over the past few months are also striking. After losing nearly 20 per cent since April due to concerns over high debt, the stock has made a comeback over the past few weeks, following RIL’s deal to sell 20 per cent of its oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco.
These long-term and short-term stock movements have many inter-connected threads. They reflect the company’s metamorphosis over the past decade from an energy-focused giant to an energy-plus-consumer business play, investor concerns about the mammoth investments and debt that have accompanied this huge DNA change, and how the company has sought to address these issues. They also offer glimpses into where the RIL juggernaut seems headed and the challenges ahead. But first, let’s cut back to a slice from the past, a crucial turning point in RIL’s evolution.
 
In May 2010, Mukesh Ambani’s RIL scored a landmark legal victory in the Supreme Court over his brother Anil Ambani’s RNRL in their bitter dispute over gas from the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin. This set into motion a chain of events that, in a few years, sent waves of disruption and upended the telecom industry.
Soon after the Supreme Court verdict, the Ambani brothers scrapped the non-compete agreement they had entered into in January 2006 as part of the family arrangement to divvy up various businesses; Mukesh had retained the core energy business while Anil got telecom, financial services, infrastructure and power.
With the non-compete clause out of the way, Mukesh lost no time in clawing his way back into telecom in which he was the original price warrior with the erstwhile Reliance Infocomm. In June 2010, Infotel Broadband, a relatively unknown entity, emerged as the sole nationwide player in the wireless broadband auction. Soon, RIL acquired 95 per cent stake in Infotel Broadband and marked its re-entry into the telecom business. RIL was already betting big on high-end data services and the wireless broadband segment. Data, as it would turn out, would be the new oil.
It helped RIL that in 2013, the new unified licence regime allowed companies with broadband spectrum to also offer voice services after paying a relatively low cost.
Competitors cried foul but this move paved the way for RIL to launch its full-fledged telecom operations under the RJio banner in September 2016. RJio announced in February 2017 that it would start its tariff plans from April 2017.








 
With worries about commercialisation of the service easing, the RIL stock took off.
Since its launch, the intense competitive pressure exerted by RJio with cheap tariffs and aggressive expansion has pushed most incumbents, including Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications, out of business. The number of telecom players in the country has shrunk from about a dozen to three major ones — RJio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea.
RJio has risen rapidly to pole position with about 330 million subscribers — a market share of over a third and growing; it targets 500 million subscribers. Even as the remaining players have been struggling with declining profits and losses, RJio has been reporting strong growth in its financial metrics — its operating revenue increased to ₹46,506 crore in FY 2019 from ₹599 crore in FY 2017, and its operating profit (EBIT) is ₹8,784 crore in FY 2019 from a loss of ₹52 crore in FY 2017.
RIL’s successful return into telecom is a game-changer for the company, primarily because RJio is the fulcrum around the company’s strategy to increasingly focus on its major consumer-facing businesses — digital and organised retail.
This September 5, RJio plans to launch its Jio Fibre service, comprising broadband, TV and landline. With proposed attractive pricing and offers, and an underpenetrated market, this too has the potential to be a big revenue driver for the company. It could disrupt the business of direct-to-home operators among other players. Also, the proposed ‘First-Day-First-Show’ to premium JioFiber customers could shake up the business of cinema operators.
Over the years, RIL has, through what resembles a ‘string of pearls’ approach, made a host of acquisitions to build a comprehensive ecosystem and integration in the digital, media and entertainment business. Besides the telecom business, the acquisitions and investments in various media, entertainment and online channels such as Network 18, Colours, Viacom and Moneycontrol, content providers such as Balaji Telefilms, and in multi-service operators and cable broadband service providers such as Hathway Cables, Den Networks and Datacom give RIL the advantages of medium, content and last-mile connectivity. While the media and entertainment business does not contribute to the bottom-line (loss of ₹52 crore in FY 2019), it gives RIL the power of content and influence. Going forward, RJio plans to set up data centres and provide various technology-based solutions to enterprises in collaboration with Microsoft.
Along with telecom, RIL has also expanded its organised retail business by leaps and bounds over the past few years. Reliance Retail started operations in 2006 and achieved cash break-even in FY2013. While the sector witnessed significant consolidation, Reliance Retail expanded rapidly to become the country’s largest retailer; it is now much bigger in revenue terms than the next five players combined. With store additions across product categories and store formats, Reliance Retail’s store count increased to 10,415 as of March 2019 from 2,621 as of March 2015. The company’s revenue grew to ₹1,30,566 crore in FY 2019 from ₹14,556 crore in FY2014, while operating profit increased to ₹5,546 crore from ₹118 crore in this period.
In addition to continuing to expand its physical store presence, Reliance Retail now plans to enter e-commerce in a big way — a space currently dominated by Amazon and Flipkart (Walmart). This, it plans to do through the online-to-offline model, in which customers search for products or services online and buy it through offline channels. Besides using its own vast network of stores, Reliance Retail plans to tie up with other local merchants for this. RIL plans to provide various technology-based services and solutions to merchants and kirana shop-owners, and sees big potential in this opportunity that it calls ‘new commerce’.
The stricter rules announced by the Government earlier this year for online marketplaces with foreign direct investment — restrictions on keeping own inventory, exclusive deals with brands and deep discounts — could end up helping Reliance Retail’s online retail foray.
That said, both Amazon and Flipkart are formidable global players with deep pockets and the early-mover advantage. They continue to invest big in the high-potential Indian online retail market. Also, they are stitching up alliances (Amazon – Future Retail, for instance) to prepare for the big fight ahead. For RIL to be as disruptive a force here, as it was in the telecom market, will not be easy.
The massive ramp-up over the past few years in the digital and retail segments has helped RIL diversify its offerings and hedge its business model to a good extent, by reducing dependence on the core hydrocarbon segments — refining and petrochemicals. In the June 2019 quarter, the consumer-facing segments contributed 32 per cent of the consolidated segment EBITDA, compared with single-digit contribution a few years back. This is in line with the long-term plan of the consumer businesses contributing equally to overall earnings as the core hydrocarbon business.
This hedged business model approach has stood RIL in good stead. For instance, in what was a difficult June 2019 quarter for the core hydrocarbon business, the retail and digital businesses saved the day for RIL. The move helps the company reduce its dependence on the oil and gas business, at a time when globally, and in India, the shift towards electric vehicles is picking pace.
Even as RIL’s large bets in the consumer-facing businesses were under way, the company invested big money in the mainstay refining and petrochemical businesses over the years. Among other initiatives, the petrochemicals capacity was nearly doubled, and the company set up its refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) complex and petcoke gasifiers as part of the facilities’ upgradation. This led to improvement in the company’s product basket, reduced dependence on imported gas and improved the gross refining margin to double-digits. RIL’s refineries and petrochemicals plants are among the world’s largest and most integrated facilities, strengthened by the paraxylene and ROGC plants.








 
The benefits of these expansions and upgrades started reflecting between FY2016 and FY2019. The operating profit of the refining business rose from ₹15,827 crore in FY2015 to ₹19,868 crore in FY2019, while that of the petrochemicals business shot up from ₹8,291 crore in FY2015 to ₹32,173 crore in FY2019. While both refining and petrochemicals are cyclical businesses, better volumes and margins have helped improve their performance over the years.
The refining and petrochemicals businesses are also major cash generators; this helped supplement the funding for the major expansion across businesses. Going forward, RIL is working on a strategy that will reconfigure its refineries to produce only jet fuel (ATF) and petrochemicals. This will hedge it against the risk of expected lower demand for transport fuels such as petrol and diesel with the advent of electric vehicles. The demand for petrochemicals is expected to continue growing at a good pace, especially in India. RIL, as the biggest domestic player and also among the largest globally, seems well-positioned.
In the wake of the deal with Saudi Aramco to sell 20 per cent of the refining and petrochemicals business, there is some speculation that the promoters will eventually exit the hydrocarbons business. While their stake (about 47 per cent currently in RIL) will come down post the deal, the promoters would still retain substantial holding and their full exit seems unlikely given the high growth potential and profitability of the businesses.
The only major business that did not click for RIL over the past decade is oil & gas (exploration and production). Its major bets — both in the domestic market (KG fields) and in the international market (US shale gas) — did not live up to expectations. A variety of problems, from pricing disputes to production declines, has seen the segment languish for many years now. In FY 2019, the business posted an operating loss of ₹1,379 crore on revenue of ₹5,005 crore. Even so, RIL, along with its partner BP (30 per cent stake), plans to invest $5 billion in the development of three projects in the KG D6 block, with the first project expected to go onstream in 2020.
Over the past five years, RIL has made massive investments of ₹5.4-lakh crore in its various businesses, a chunk of it (about ₹3.5 lakh crore) in telecom. This has started paying off well, with net profit rising from ₹23,566 crore in FY2015 to ₹39,588 crore in FY2019, a growth of nearly 70 per cent. The smart jump in profits in FY2017 and FY2018, coupled with the commercialisation of RJio’s services in early 2017, seems to have assuaged investor’s worries, and the RIL stock has rallied handsomely.
Yet, the heavy debt taken to finance the growth has increased the strain on the balance-sheet and raised some concerns. A recent report from brokerage Credit Suisse had said that RIL’s financing liabilities had increased from $19 billion in FY2015 to $65 billion in FY2019; its net debt had risen from $2.7 billion to $12.4 billion in this period and additional debt in the consolidated balance-sheet rose from $9.4 billion to $20.6 billion. This had led to an increase in interest cost from $1.2 billion in FY2015 to $4 billion in FY2019. The report had said that RIL had been free cash-flow negative for six years, and that its interest cost amounted to a high 44 per cent of operating profit (EBIT). Concerns about high debt levels, along with a muted June 2019 quarter and market weakness, saw the RIL stock slip about 20 per cent since April this year.
So, the announcement made three weeks back about the RIL-Saudi Aramco deal saw the stock take wing again. RIL’s agreement with Aramco, subject to approvals, to sell a 20 per cent stake in its oil-to-chemicals business at an enterprise value of $75 billion has many positives for RIL. One, the valuation is quite attractive. Two, the deal should fetch RIL about $15 billion (about ₹1-lakh crore) and help the company deleverage significantly. Next, it should bolster its crude oil sourcing capability, given that a key oil supplier will also become an investor in the business. Besides, it fits in with RIL’s strategy to increase the share of the consumer-facing segments to overall profits. The deal with Aramco covers RIL’s refining and petrochemicals assets as well as RIL’s 51 per cent stake in the proposed fuel retailing business joint venture with BP.
In recent times, RIL has also entered into other deals that should help reduce its debt levels. The fuel retailing joint venture with BP should fetch RIL about ₹7,000 crore, and asset manager Brookfield has agreed to invest about ₹25,000 crore in RIL’s telecom tower assets. Besides, RIL is looking at value-unlocking options from its real estate and financial investments. Seen together, all this fits in well with Mukesh Ambani’s announcement to make RIL a zero net-debt company in 18 months. As of March 2019, the company’s net debt (debt less cash and marketable investments) was about ₹1.54 lakh crore.
Historically, RIL’s philosophy has been to build businesses on equity capital and rely less on debt. The Aramco deal is in line with this approach. RIL’s debt-to-equity ratio at a consolidated level (0.74 as of March 2019) has stayed reasonable at under one time, despite the huge capex over the past few years, and recent deals should help bring it down further.
The good growth prospects for the company’s main businesses — oil-to-chemicals, digital and retail — bode well for investors. So do the proposed deleveraging plans. Besides, the planned move to list Reliance Retail and RJio within the next five years could result in value-unlocking for RIL’s investors. Also, Mukesh Ambani’s assurance of rewarding shareholders through higher dividends, periodic bonus issues and other means should keep interest in the stock ticking.
In the near term, the troubles in the global and domestic economy could affect RIL’s businesses — especially the cyclical refining and petrochemicals segments. But the company has the muscle to weather the tide. Once the proposed deals with Aramco and BP are completed, there will be a dip in RIL’s revenue due to reduced stake. But this should be more than offset by lower interest cost. At about ₹1,250, the stock trades at a reasonable 13.5 times FY2021 estimated earnings as per Bloomberg consensus estimates, just a tad higher than the three-year average of about 12.5 times.
There are some external risks though. Over the years, RIL’s, especially RJio’s, breakneck growth has invited allegations from the competition, even if sotto voce, of partisan policy benefits and regulatory capture.
From many players, the telecom sector in the country has now become an oligopoly and runs the risk of becoming a duopoly or even a monopoly in the coming years. This could eventually see the competition law kick in and bring about curbs."
65,2019-09-05,Reliance,"RJio rolls out broadband operations with slew of freebies
Mukesh Ambani’s RJio on Thursday launched its optical fibre broadband services starting at ₹699 per month for an 100 Mpbs connection bundled with 100 GB of data.
High-end consumers can get up to 500 GB of data at 1 Gbps speeds by paying ₹8,499 a month. There is a one-time upfront fee of ₹2,500, of which ₹1,000 is non-refundable.
Though the tariffs per se are not the cheapest in the country, RJio is bundling a whole host of services with the broadband connection. Every user gets a fixed line phone which can be used to make free voice calls to anywhere within the country. Also available for free are video-conferencing facilities on TV and gaming and security services. Tariff plans above ₹3,999 offer access to virtual reality experiences. High-end users also get to watch movies on the same day they are released in theatres.
As an introductory offer, RJio is giving away its 4K set-top box worth ₹6,400 and Jio Home Gateway worth ₹5,000 bundled with all tariff plans. It has also bundled three-month subscriptions of OTT platforms with each connection though it is not clear which applications will be made available.
RJio is also offering annualised plans starting at ₹8,388 for 100 Mbps speed with 1,200 GB for 12 months. The top-end annual plan is priced at over ₹1 lakh, which offers 1 Gpbs speed and 60,000 GB data. This plan comes with a 4K 43-inch TV worth nearly ₹45,000."
64,2019-09-06,Reliance,"RJio eyes new markets to fire its optical fibre dreams
Reliance Jio’s new optical fibre broadband service is not the cheapest in the country, it but offers a slew of added services and hardware bundled with a connection.
RJio’s lowest tariff plan starts at Rs 699 a month. There are many local players such as ACT Fibre which offers broadband services at lower price points. Even state-owned BSNL offers plans that are cheaper.
 
However, there is no other operator that can match Reliance Jio’s coverage of 1,600 cities. Most of the other private players are focused on the top urban areas. Airtel, which is RJio’s top rival, offers fibre broadband in about 90 cities. BSNL’s national network primarily runs on copper wires, which has a lesser capacity compared to optical fibre cables.
“Unlike mobile services where RJio disrupted the market by dropping data tariffs, in the case of broadband services, RJio’s disruption is in creating infrastructure,” said a market analyst.
When it comes to adopting digitisation and online platforms, Indian users are among the top consumers globally. The growth in consumption of video and online content has been growing exponentially over the last two years.
However, when it comes to network quality, Indian consumers are behind global benchmarks. Until recently, mobile operators were adopting a piecemeal approach in establishing a high-speed broadband infrastructure.
The scenario changed in 2016 after RJio launched 4G services at price points that were drastically lower than the prevailing tariffs. Since then, data consumption has shot through the roof, with over 500 million users having access to data services. But when more Indians come online and start consuming data, then the existing wireless networks will not be enough to support that demand.
Optical fibre networks have the capability to carry more data than a wireless network because the latter’s capacity is dependent on the quantum of radio spectrum. Spectrum, being a finite resource, can only be useful for carrying applications that do not require large bandwidth. Mission-critical applications such as healthcare and education can proliferate only when there is a robust optical fibre broadband backbone.
Analysts said that the company could not have played the pricing game, given the pressure on its balancesheet. Recently, Mukesh Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Industries, announced his mission to cut down debt to zero in 18 months. “Given that RJio has already leaked money on its mobile services, it would not have been wise to play the pricing game in broadband,” said a former executive of a top telecom company.
Unlike in mobile services, where competition is high, the market for fixed broadband is very small. Therefore, RJio’s focus seems to be on growing the market, rather than fighting for the existing pie.
The other big disruption that could come about with RJio’s launch is the way consumers watch TV content. By offering bundled TV channels and OTT applications, RJio is hoping that viewers of DTH and cable TV will switch to broadband-based entertainment.
To drive this shift, RJio is bundling a host of services with the broadband connection. Every user gets a fixed line phone, which can be used to make free voice calls anywhere within the country. Also available for free are video-conferencing facilities on TV and gaming and security services. Tariff plans above ₹3,999 offer access to virtual reality experiences.

63,2019-09-08,Reliance,"RIL seeks $5.4 per unit for new gas from KG-D6 block


KG-D6 block.




KG-D6 block.


 Reliance Industries is seeking a minimum price of USD 5.4 per unit for the natural gas it plans to produce from newer fields in the Bay of Bengal block KG-D6 as it changed parameters to suit government policies.
Reliance and its partner BP Plc of the UK have sought bids from potential users for the 5 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas they plan to produce from the R-Cluster Field in KG-D6 block from the second quarter of 2020, according to the bid document.
Bidders have been asked to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required. Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.
It set a floor or minimum quote of 9 per cent of dated Brent price -- which means bidders would have to quote 9 or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.

At USD 60 per barrel price, the gas price comes to USD 5.4 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). E-bidding would happen on October 10, the bid document said.
The rate compares to the government-mandated USD 3.69 rate that its currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 fields in KG-D6 block are getting.
The government gas pricing policy, however, provides for a higher cap price for future gas produced from difficult fields like those in deepsea. This cap currently is fixed at USD 9.32 per mmBtu. Reliance and BP are developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites and MJ by 2022.
The document said the gas price would be lower of the quoted rate or the government-mandated ceiling for the difficult fields. The formula Reliance is using to price gas for R-Series fields is different from its last price discovery it made for the coal seam gas (CBM) from its Sohagpur coal-bed methane blocks in Madhya Pradesh.
For Sohagpur CBM, it had in 2012 sought bids at a benchmarked rate at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu.
The formula was the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public sector oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to buy long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.
At USD 60 per barrel oil price, CBM from its Madhya Pradesh block was to cost USD 7.8. That formula was, however, rejected by the oil ministry even though 59 valid bids seeking about 70 mmscmd of gas were received in the open tender.
It in 2017 changed the formula by seeking bids in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of prevailing Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.52 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, according to the bid document of CBM pricing.
Reliance ended up buying the CBM gas from its block after it bid deducting USD 1.836 per mmBtu, lower than USD 3.156 bid by rival Piramal Glass and USD 3.495 bid by state-owned GAIL."
62,2019-09-12,Reliance,"Reliance moots ‘supply or pay’ model for new gas fields
With gas output from its fields not matching commitments in the past, Reliance Industries is offering ‘supply or pay’ contracts for natural gas it plans to produce from newer fields beginning mid-2020, with an obligation to pay if it is unable to supply.
Reliance and its partner BP of UK, in a notice inviting offer (NIO) for sale of gas from R-Series fields in the KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal have, for the first time, offered to pay the buyer for the purchase of alternative fuel for the default quantity.
This clause is in addition to the take-or-pay clause requiring the buyer to offtake the committed quantity or pay for it.
“If a shortfall quantity arises in a quarter, then, sellers shall reimburse buyer as liquidated damages for the purchase by buyer of a quantity of gas equal to such shortfall quantity,” according to the gas sales purchase agreement (GSPA) accompanying the NIO. It provides for the buyer procuring the replacement quantity on a competitive price and provides the sellers detailed documentary evidence of all costs.
Reliance had in the past committed to supplying as much as 60 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) of gas from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&D3) and MA fields in the KG-D6 block and signed committed GSPAs with fertiliser, power and other consumers.
But output lagged commitment with gas production beginning to dip within two years of the start of production in April 2009. The production now is 1.3 mmscmd, leaving several committed customers having to buy gas from other sources or shut plants.
MA field ceased to produce last year.
Reliance-BP are developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block — R-Cluster, Satellites and MJ by 2022 that can produce a peak of 30 mmscmd of gas. The quantity offered for bidding in the NIO is 5 mmscmd from R-Series fields which will start production in mid-2020.
Officials said peak output from R-Series is 12 mmscmd, while Satellites will produce another 7 mmscmd beginning mid-2021. MJ field, which will start production in the second half of 2022, also has a planned peak output of 12 mmscmd.
While Reliance-BP is confident of meeting supply commitments from these fields, they are offering additional comfort to buyers through the supply-or-pay clause, they said.
The GSPA has also introduced anti-bribery and anti-money laundering clauses that provide for “immediate termination” of the agreement and recovery of any losses in case of violation.
Reliance and BP sought an undertaking that the buyer or its affiliates had not bribed anyone in the past five years and none of their directors, officers, or key employees has been convicted or investigated of any offence involving money laundering in the past 10 years.
It sought indemnity for the sellers (Reliance and BP) from any loss or damage due to failure of contractors or third parties associated with buyers to comply with bribery and anti-money laundering laws.
The company asked the seller to inform it in writing of any breach of these laws by any of the contractors or third parties to the gas sale agreements.
Reliance, which is the operator of KG-D6 with 60 per cent stake, has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block.
Of these, Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 & D3) — the largest among the lot — were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put to production in September 2008.
BP holds 30 per cent stake in the block while the remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources of Canada."

SBI (₹291.7)
After trading within a range, SBI began to head north and gained throughout the week, breaking above the critical resistance at ₹280. In fact, it was the biggest weekly gain for the stock in the past 16 weeks, moving up by 6.5 per cent. The weekly chart of SBI shows a morning star candlestick pattern, indicating a potential reversal in the medium-term trend. The stock has also moved past its 21-day moving average, which also indicates strongbuying interest in the past week. The daily relative strength index has crossed the mid-point level of 50 after nearly two months, and the moving average convergence divergence indicator also points upwards, implying considerable strength in the bullish trend. Assuming that the prevailing bullish sentiment will help the stock go up further, breaking a resistance at ₹292 will help the stock move towards the ₹300 levels and beyond in the medium term. But if the stock witnesses profit-booking or reacts to the resistance and slides lower, it might decline to ₹288 levels, below which the support is at ₹280.
 










 
ITC (₹239.9)
ITC continues to be held within the ₹240-247 limits. After testing the upper limit of the range at ₹247 — where the 21-day moving average level too coincides — failed to break above and corrected from that level towards the lower limit of the range at ₹240. Most of the decline was during the last two trading sessions, when the stock lost 1.6 per cent. The daily relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator remains flat, implying a lack of trend. Hence, unless the stock breaks either of the limits of the consolidation range, it is better to stay away from initiating new positions. If the weakness in the latter part of the previous week pulls down the price of the scrip further and it goes below ₹240, the immediate support lies at ₹236. If the stock declines below ₹236, the sell-off could intensify and the price might tumble to ₹224 levels. Alternatively, a bounce from the current level will result in the stock inching up towards ₹247 in the upcoming week, beyond which it will face a resistance in the band between ₹250 and ₹252 levels.
 










 
Infosys (₹829.3)
The stock of Infosys could not continue its uptrend. The stock corrected in the past week when the price dropped to a low of ₹810.85, after opening the week a bit lower at ₹836.80 against ₹840.15 — its previous week close. The stock was supported by 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bullish swing at ₹814. And, on Friday, the stock recovered some of its losses as it opened the session at ₹818.65 and closed higher at ₹829.3 levels. The scrip still trades above 21-day moving average, thereby not posing any immediate threat to the prevailing bullish trend. The relative strength index continue to feature in bullish zone. Hence, if the stock regains the momentum and goes up, it will most likely appreciate towards a lifetime high at ₹847 and even to ₹875 levels in medium term. On the other hand, if the stock is weighed down by factors such as profit-booking or a stronger rupee, it is most likely to drift towards the support band between ₹800 and ₹804 — the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of previous swing in the coming week.
 










 
RIL (₹1225.6)
Reliance Industries continues to trade within a tight range — between ₹1,200 and ₹1,240. The upside for the stock is blocked by the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, essentially lying in the same price area, near the ₹1,240 levels. A prolonged consolidation might reduce the significance of both the moving averages, unless the stock moves out of the band. . The relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator plotted on the daily chart of the stock stay direction-less, failing to provide any clue about the upcoming trend. So, until the stock breaks out of the tight price range within which it is oscillating, it might prove costly to make any directional bets. In case the stock moves up buoyed by the positive sentiment in the equity benchmarks and breaches ₹1,240, it is very likely that the price will appreciate to ₹1,300 levels, thereby moving past both the moving average, which may also push RSI above 50. However, if the stock breaks the lower boundary of the range, immediate support is at ₹1,180 and ₹1,140 thereafter.
 










Tata Steel (₹367.35)
Tata Steel edged up last week and closed with a weekly gain of 3.4 per cent. Thus, the share price of the steel major has posted gains for the second consecutive week. The stock has moved beyond the 21-day moving average, as it witnessed some buying interest in the past two weeks. On Friday, the scrip, after opening at ₹367.05, closed the day at ₹367.35 — the 38 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend. Though the stock made a high of ₹379.5 on Thursday, it could not hold on, declining and closing the session at ₹365.05, witnessing some selling pressure. Daily candle on Thursday is a shooting star pattern, meaning there are chances for reversal in the trend. The relative strength index too is nearing the mid-point of 50, and a decisive break above that level may help the stock appreciate further towards ₹395 levels. On the other hand, if the stock price depreciates from the current levels, it will most probably retest ₹350 — the 21-day moving average — below which it could tumble to ₹330 levels."
60,2019-09-15,Reliance,"Reliance, BP take over Niko’s 10% stake in KG-D6 block 
 Reliance Industries and UK’s BP Plc have taken over the 10 per cent shareholding of their partner Niko Resources in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block after the Canadian firm defaulted on paying for its share of gas field development cost.
Sources with knowledge of the development said the oil minister has given ‘unconditional’ nod to Reliance and BP for taking over 10 per cent interest of Niko in KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal.
Reliance and BP split Niko’s share in proportion to their existing shareholding in the block.
Subsequently, Reliance’s stake in KG-D6 has gone up to 66.67 per cent from previous 60 per cent and that of BP to 33.33 per cent from 30 per cent, the sources said.
E-mails sent to Reliance and BP for comments remained unanswered.
Niko, which defaulted on payment of loans to its lenders, has been unsuccessful in seeking a possible buyer for its 10 per cent stake in Bay of Bengal block KG-D6 or securing financing for its share of the $5 billion R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ development projects in the block. This led to the company defaulting in making payments for its share of development cost in early October 2018.
Reliance, being the operator of KG-D6 block, slapped a default notice on Niko soon after, sources said.
Under the terms of the joint operating agreement (JOA) between the participating interest holders in the KG-D6 production sharing contract (PSC), during the continuance of a default, the defaulting party shall not have a right to its share of revenue (which shall vest in and be the property of the non-defaulting parties who have paid to cover the amount in default)."

 Billionaire Mukesh Ambani has raised promoter stake in flagship Reliance Industries by 2.71 per cent to 48.87 per cent, according to regulatory filing by the company.
Reliance Services and Holdings Ltd, controlled by promoter group firm Petroleum Trust, acquired 17.18 crore shares or 2.71 per cent stake in Reliance on September 13, it said. The acquisition was pursuant to a scheme of arrangement not directly involving Reliance, the filing said without giving details.
Ambani and his private firms held 47.29 per cent stake as on June 30, 2019 in India’s second-most valuable company. As on June 30, FIIs held 24.4 per cent stake in the firm, mutual funds had 4.56 per cent and insurance companies 7.1 per cent. The remaining share was with public.

 Reliance Industries on Thursday clarified that promoter and chairman Mukesh Ambani has not acquired any new shares in the company and that his stake has not increased.
 This statement comes after the company had on September 17 through a ‘Disclosure under Reg/29(2) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011’ said that Reliance Services and Holdings Ltd (controlled by Petroleum Trust - a part of promoter/promoter group) has acquired 17.18 crore or 2.71 per cent stake in the company “pursuant to a scheme of arrangement not directly involving the target company (Reliance)”.
 “The aggregate shareholding/voting rights of the Promote and Promote Group now stands at 309.8 crore shares - 48.87 per cent,” it had said. The company’s filing to stock exchanges for the shareholding pattern for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, showed promoter group holding at 47.29 per cent. The company in an emailed statement said: “There has been no transaction of purchase of shares”.
 It said: “41.28 crore treasury shares of Reliance Industries were held as follows by (a) by Petroleum Trust 24.09 crore shares; and (b) by subsidiaries of RIL 17.19 crore shares. “As a part of an ongoing internal restructuring of RIL subsidiaries, 5 subsidiaries holding 17.19 crore shares have merged with Reliance Services and Holdings Ltd (RSHL), a company controlled by Petroleum Trust,” it said. Petroleum Trust has been named as a promoter group entity since its inception in 2002.
 “The sole beneficiary of Petroleum Trust is Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL), a 100 per cent subsidiary of RIL and hence the ultimate beneficiaries of these shares are the shareholders of RIL,” it said. “RIL’s filings on the shareholding pattern with the regulatory authorities have always included Petroleum Trust as part of the promoter group.” 
“Since the 17.19 crore shares have come under the control of Petroleum Trust, requisite disclosure under the Takeover Regulations have been made by RSHL. Thus, this disclosure is only a re-categorisation of the existing treasury shares. No new shares have been acquired and Mukesh Ambani’s stake in RIL has not gone up,” it added."

SBI began the week marginally lower at ₹288.2 compared with the previous week close of ₹291.7. The stock declined further to ₹273 levels during the earlier part of the week. However, on Friday, it surged with huge volumes and closed the day with 10 per cent gain. It also moved past resistances at ₹292 and ₹300, closing the week at ₹301.7, posting a considerable weekly gain of 3.4 per cent. Before moderating to ₹301.7, the stock registered a high of ₹307.65, where the 50-day moving average lies. There’s a resistance in the band between ₹305.1 — the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level — and ₹307.65. With the daily relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator pointing upwards and the stock breaking above ₹300, the current rally may continue to push the stock price up to ₹318 and then to ₹320 levels. Alternatively, if the stock slides down after testing the resistance band between ₹307.65 and ₹305.1, it might decline to ₹292 levels.










ITC (₹238.05)
ITC, the stock price of which has been trading in a range between ₹240 and ₹247, declined below the lower limit on Tuesday. The stock retested a support at ₹234.65, from where the price attempted to recover twice in the past one month. However, on both occasions, the recovery was blocked by resistance at ₹247. As a result, the stock seems to have formed a broader range between ₹234.65 and ₹247. Even on Friday, after appreciating to the resistance at ₹247, the stock could not hold on and gave up most of its gains towards the end of the session. The scrip closed the week at ₹238.05. Hence, for the stock to start trending, it must either decisively break above ₹247 or below ₹234.6. In case the stock attracts buying interest and moves past the resistance at ₹247, it may appreciate towards the resistance band between ₹250 and ₹252. But if the stock slips below ₹234, the sell-off could intensify and the price might tumble to ₹224 levels.










Infosys (₹805)
The stock of Infosys was consolidating for the week after a mute opening on Monday. But on Friday, the stock price of the IT major slumped and it lost 1.9 per cent during the session. It closed below 21-day moving average, indicating a potential reversal in short-term trend. With a close at ₹805, the stock has also breached a support at ₹814, where the 38.2 per cent of Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bullish swing coincides. Currently, the fall is arrested by a support in the band between ₹800 and ₹804. The relative strength index has crossed below the mid-point of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence too shows weakness, indicating further depreciation. Hence, if the price breaks below ₹800, it could fall to the support at ₹793, where the important 61.8 Fibonacci retracement level coincides. The 50-day moving average is at ₹792, making that price area a significant support. But if the price recovers from the current level, it may rally to ₹814.










RIL (₹1254.35)
The stock price of Reliance Industries was trading without showing any trend till Thursday. However, on Friday, after making an intra-day low of ₹1,174.3, the stock price rose rapidly and closed at ₹1254.35. Intra-day gain of the stock stood at 6.4 per cent. It registered an intra-day high of ₹1,269.9, which is also the month-to-date high. That way, it has breached a considerable resistance at ₹1,240. The stock has also zoomed past both the 21- and 50-day moving averages. Hence, the prevailing positive sentiment opens the door for the stock to appreciate towards ₹1,300, which is a key level from a medium-term perspective. This is because beyond ₹1,300, the stock has the potential to turn the medium-term trend bullish. Alternatively, in a less likely scenario where the stock moderates from the current levels, the price band between ₹1,230 and ₹1,240 will act as a solid support, limiting the correction. The probability of the price declining below these levels is low.










Tata Steel (₹368.55)
The share price of Tata Steel looked unsteady as it began the week at ₹362 and slid to ₹342 levels, moving below the support at ₹350. On Friday though, on the back of broad-based buying, the stock price went up, reclaiming the previous week high of ₹379.5. Interestingly, the stock faced selling pressure towards the close of Friday’s session, giving up some of its gains and wrapped up for the week at ₹368.5. Comparing this with ₹367.3 — the previous week closing price — there is essentially not much change. Hence, it is reiterated that a close above ₹380 is a prerequisite for the stock to move to higher levels. Noticeably, both the relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator point upwards, indicating a build-up in positive sentiment. In such a case, the stock may appreciate to ₹395, beyond which it will face a hurdle at ₹400. But, if the stock is sold off from the current levels, it may decline to ₹350."
55,2019-09-23,Reliance,"Corporate tax cuts: Stocks that gain the most
Earnings growth for India Inc, which has been on first gear in recent times, is all set to receive a boost from lower tax outgo, with the reduced corporate tax rates. For many manufacturing companies, the savings on this front could give them room to reduce prices or improve other spends, thereby spurring demand. Many companies in sectors such as infrastructure, capital goods and FMCG stand to gain. Some others in the auto, steel, oil and gas, and real-estate segments could also get a leg-up. IT companies may be better off under the current regime though, given the lower tax incidence at present.
Most companies in the information technology space will not be enthused by the corporate tax rate cuts announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. There are two reasons. Many companies have an effective corporate tax rate below 25.17 per cent (including surcharge and cess) and they get the benefit of profit-based deductions for exporting their services from special economic zones in India.
Also, IT and software companies that build their own intellectual property get a weighted deduction under the income-tax laws on the R&D expenses that they have incurred to build their IP.
Now, such companies might have to pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) calculated on their book profits.
The Finance Minister has slashed MAT from 18.5 per cent to 15 per cent. That puts the effective tax rate, including surcharge, for companies paying MAT at 17.5 per cent compared with 21.6 per cent earlier.
This means that IT companies that get tax deductions on their export revenues earned from operating in SEZs, and pay MAT, wouldn’t want to opt out of claiming these deductions. They would also have to forego the weighted deduction on R&D that brings down the effective corporate tax rate.
Besides, if they opt for the lower effective corporate tax rate of 25.2 per cent, they will have to take a one-time charge of any MAT credit that might be in their books.
In 2018-19, out of the top-tier IT companies in the S&P BSE IT Index, only Infosys (26 per cent) had an effective tax rate of over 25 per cent at the standalone level, while TCS (21.3 per cent), HCL Technologies (23.7 per cent), Wipro (23.02 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (19.6 per cent) had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
Even most mid-tier IT companies such as Mphasis (20.5 per cent), Hexaware (22.3 per cent), Mindtree (24.9 per cent), L&T Infotech (21.7 per cent) and L&T Technology Services (24.2 per cent), had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
In all, IT companies won’t be rushing to opt out of their export-based tax incentives until the benefit of paying lower taxes on export revenues runs out.
With major players such as Hindustan Unilever, Nestle, Britannia, GSK Consumer and Colgate-Palmolive suffering an effective tax of 32-36 per cent, the FMCG segment could be a beneficiary of the new 25.17 per cent tax rate.
At the same time, home-grown companies such as Dabur, Jyothy Labs, Godrej Consumer, Bajaj Consumer and Marico may not choose to move to the new regime, considering that their effective tax rates are either on a par with or lower than 25.17 per cent.
Overall, for shareholders in FMCG stocks, this move could result in the 2018-19 profits of listed FMCG players, on an aggregate, inching up by 9 per cent.
However, FMCG companies can choose to retain a portion of the benefits to increase advertising spends and/or pass it on as price cuts to boost demand. In the quarter-ended June 2019, for instance, major FMCG companies clocked single-digit growth in sales due to poor volumes.
Going by the 2018-19 numbers, Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motors and Maruti Suzuki and Eicher Motors have an effective tax rate of 29-33 per cent and could benefit from the reduced rates. However, the rates of Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland, are much lower. Taking M&M ‘s reported tax expenses (standalone) for 2018-19, the effective tax rate is only at 24.17 per cent (21.3 per cent, considering the current year's tax expense alone).
The company also has a MAT credit of ₹1,116.35 crore in its books as on March 31, 2019. Ashok Leyland’s effective tax rate, given the reported tax expense for 2018-19, is 20.6 per cent (15.14 per cent taking the current year's expense alone). The company has availed itself of benefit to the extent of ₹233 crore on tax concessions and tax holidays in 2018-19 and has MAT credit on its books.
In such cases, companies may choose to continue under the current regime till the tax holiday/concessions exist. Since MAT also continues at a reduced rate of 15 per cent, these companies can choose to pay tax as per normal rates or as per MAT, whichever is higher — as has been the case until now. MAT credit can also be set off against the tax liability in future years.
Among auto ancillaries, MNC players such as SKF India, Goodyear and Bosch that have high effective tax rates of 33-36 per cent could be major beneficiaries. Put together, listed companies in the auto and auto ancillaries space may see a 3-5 per cent addition to their profits of 2018-19, if they choose to avail themselves of the 25.17 per cent tax rate.
For infrastructure companies, the effective tax rates in FY19, after taking into account all eligible exemptions and tax holidays, work out to 27-35 per cent of their standalone PBT. For companies such as Engineers India, Ircon International, Ashoka Buildcon and RITES, availing themselves of the lower tax rate of 25.17 per cent could translate to a 14-18 per cent jump in earnings, going forward. Whereas, giants such as Larsen & Toubro and IRB Infra developers could witness only a 2 and 5 per cent rise in PAT led by tax savings.
Among the pure construction players, NCC, Welspun and Sadhbav Engg could benefit. Certain companies have effective tax rates of less than 25 per cent, which can be on account of payment of minimum alternate tax, or availing themselves of benefits of differential depreciation on fixed assets under the IT Act. The effects of the amendments announced will hence have to be evaluated on a case-to-case basis.
For instance, Dilip Buildcon has an effective tax rate of 16 per cent in FY19 on account of MAT provisions (inferred from the annual report). Hence, the lowered MAT rates could bring down its effective tax rate further, and the company would also get the existing MAT credit entitlement.
On the other hand, Adani Port and SEZ now enjoy an effective tax rate of 21 per cent, after availing itself of deductions under Section 80IAB of the Income Tax Act for 10 years, with effect from FY07-08. This apart, it has several subsidiaries and joint ventures that can get tax holiday benefits under Section 80IA.
The company is also likely to benefit from the grandfathering of taxes on buyback, as the management had made a public announcement of the share buyback of ₹1,960 crore on June 4, 2019.
Among the cement manufacturers, the effective tax rate in FY19 for most companies (on a standalone basis) is less than 25 per cent — they may refrain from foregoing their exemptions and deductions. This includes large players like Ultratech and Shree Cement. However, there could be savings in PAT in the range of 11-15 per cent for Himadri, Deccan and India Cements if they opt for the subsidised rates, as their current effective tax rate is more than 25.17 per cent.
The impact of the lower corporate tax on the steel industry is expected to be mixed, at least in the near future.
The tax incidence on companies such as Tata Steel, Kalyani Steels and Jindal Stainless Hisar in FY19 was 39 per cent, 33 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively. Note that these are the tax rates after taking into account the tax exemptions that the companies are eligible for. Thus, these companies stand to gain in a big way if they opt for the reduced tax rate of 22 per cent (25.17 per cent including surcharge and cess).
Companies such as JSW Steel and Tata Metaliks with effective tax rates of 20 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, may not opt for the reduced tax rate immediately. Meanwhile, SAIL, Jindal Steel and Uttam Galva had zero current tax for FY19. This could be either due to companies making losses in FY19 or accumulated losses from previous years, setting off the year’s profits. If the new reduced tax rate is opted, setting-off of losses will not be possible, making it unattractive. However, in the long run, when the companies turn profitable or become eligible to pay MAT, they can opt for the new tax rates, which could reduce their tax outgo.
The move to reduce corporate tax seems largely positive for real-estate companies reeling under pressure due to tight liquidity in the market. For most realty companies, the effective tax rate is higher than 25.17 per cent (including cess and surcharge), based on standalone profit before tax. For instance, for Oberoi Realty and Ashiana Housing, the current tax rate is 29 per cent, while for Kolte-Patil, it works out to around 45 per cent.
These companies, if they adopt the new corporate tax regime, could improve their earnings, even if they forego their exemptions and MAT credit.
If players pass on the benefit to home buyers, it could spur demand in the market.
But for companies such as Sunteck Realty and Prestige Estate Properties, for which the effective current year tax rates work out to less than 5 per cent, and Brigade Enterprises and Sobha with 23 per cent rate, continuing with the existing tax structure may be better.
For the oil and gas sector, the cut in corporate tax rate seems largely positive. Going by their FY19 standalone financials, the effective tax rate for most companies in the sector is higher than the 25.17 per cent rate (including surcharge and cess) that will apply to them now. For instance, in FY19, the current tax provision of city gas distributors Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas was about 31 per cent of their profit before tax.
The effective tax rate for the PSU hydrocarbon explorers, ONGC and Oil India, and gas transmitter GAIL (India) was 27-28 per cent, while it was about 29 per cent for PSU refiner HPCL. The highest tax rate — about 32 per cent — was borne by Gujarat-based gas transmitter GSPL. For the above companies, the new tax rate of 22 per cent plus surcharge of 10 per cent and cess of 4 per cent — totalling 25.17 per cent — should translate into lower tax outgo. Even if these companies have to give up some investment-based tax exemptions and credit of minimum alternate tax carried forward from earlier years, they should be better off under the new tax rate regime.
On the other hand, there are a few companies such as Reliance Industries, PSU refiners Indian Oil and BPCL, and gas importer Petronet LNG that may not benefit from the new tax rate. In FY19, the current tax provision of Reliance Industries, Indian Oil and BPCL was about 20 per cent of their profit before tax — this is lower than the new effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
It is the same case for Petronet LNG, which had an effective tax rate of about 24 per cent last year. For these companies, it may be worthwhile continuing with their existing tax structure, taking the benefits, if any, of investment-based tax exemptions, and carried forward MAT credit and carried forward loss.
In the case of Reliance Industries, for instance, while the applicable tax rate in FY19 was 34.94 per cent, it was able to reduce the effective rate (excluding deferred tax adjustments) to about 20 per cent, thanks to exempted income, and additional allowances net of MAT credit.
The company may likely find it more beneficial to continue with this arrangement until the tax breaks that keep the effective tax low are exhausted.
Later, it could shift to the new regime with the effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman opened the liquidity tap for corporates on Friday by announcing a sharp tax cut and leaving more money in their hands for capacity expansion. The statutory tax rate for corporates has been lowered to 22 per cent from 30 per cent. This benefit, though, is only for companies that wish to give up their tax exemptions. Given that most tax incentives and exemptions have been phased out over the past few years, companies may prefer to forego the few they enjoy now, and opt to be taxed at the lower rate of 22 per cent.
New manufacturing companies incorporated after October 1, 2019, can benefit from an even lower rate of 15 per cent tax if they don’t claim the tax benefits they are eligible for. India Inc will also get relief on MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax). The Finance Minister has reduced MAT to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent. This would benefit companies located in SEZ developers, infrastructure, cement companies, companies with units in specified locations in the North-East and exporters. There is also relief on buyback tax.
The 20 per cent tax on buybacks by corporates, which was announced in the Budget on July 5, 2019, would not apply to companies that announced them before the Budget day. According to data from nseinfobase.com, companies, including Sasken Technologies, Greaves Cotton, Welspun Corp, Star Cement and Eris Lifesciences, whose issues are on the way, but were announced before July 5, and for companies such as Infosys, which had buybacks ongoing in July, will benefit from the change. Wipro is also set to benefit as it announced its buyback on June 5.
Companies that pay corporate taxes under the new rates of 15 and 22 per cent will be charged a flat surcharge of 10 per cent, irrespective of their taxable income. The companies that choose the existing regime, availing exemptions and deductions, will have to pay a surcharge only if their total income exceeds ₹1 crore. The rates of surcharge for them will continue to be at 7 per cent and 12 per cent, for total income between ₹1 crore and ₹10 crore and more than ₹10 crore, respectively.
The stock market on Friday cheered the Finance Minister’s move to cut taxes. While companies that are currently paying lower rates due to various deductions and exemptions, such as many information technology players, are unlikely to shift to the new regime, there are many companies across sectors that are likely to see their tax incidence move lower, thus translating to higher profits. If the lower tax incidence is passed on to customers in the form of price cuts, it can help spur demand.
 








 
Ever since the late Finance Minister Arun Jaitley kick-started the process of a phased reduction in corporate tax in 2016-17 and elimination of exemptions, the effective tax rate for India Inc has only gone up.
This is because, while smaller companies were given the benefit of a lower tax rate each year, the phasing out of some tax deductions began impacting the tax outgo of larger companies.
Further, in 2015-16, the Finance Minister also increased the surcharge on corporate tax. That year, for companies with income of up to ₹10 crore, the surcharge was increased to 7 per cent from 5 per cent, and for firms with income above ₹10 crore, it was increased to 12 per cent from 10 per cent. Thus, the effective tax rate in 2017-18 came to 29.49 per cent; it was 23.22 per cent in 2013-14. This increase — evident in the numbers of the past one year — was due to larger companies coughing up more.
In 2017-18, the effective tax rate for companies making profit of more than ₹500 crore was 26.3 per cent; in 2016-17, it was 23.94 per cent. The effective tax rate for smaller companies making profit of ₹1-10 crore came down to 27.38 per cent from 29.2 per cent. So far, withdrawal of tax exemptions has made the effective tax rate of larger companies move higher. It is from here on that these companies will start benefiting.
Now, all companies that are willing to give up their tax incentives can pay taxes at a fairly lower rate of 22 per cent.
 
India is now among the countries that have a low corporate tax rate, and can compete better globally. For the current year, KPMG data show that the statutory tax rate in Myanmar is 25 per cent; in Malaysia, it is 24 per cent; 25 per cent in Indonesia and Korea and 28 per cent in Sri Lanka. Even Chinese companies cough up more — as they pay a tax of 25 per cent — and in Brazil, it is 34 per cent.
The global average corporate tax rate is 23.79 now, and the Asian average is 21.09 per cent. That said, the current move to cut taxes is going to make a hole in the government’s tax kitty. Last year, as per the Budget estimates, the revenue foregone by the Centre on various tax incentives was ₹1.08-lakh crore. Now, with tax cuts, there will be an additional revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore.
 
Bond investors who have been basking in the double-digit return glory over the past year may be in for a bumpy ride ahead. While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s corporate tax rate cut has cheered India Inc and the equity market, the move is a dampener for bond markets.
This is because the revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore owing to the cut will throw the Centre’s fiscal deficit target off track. The RBI’s surplus transfer to the Centre, at best, makes up for the existing shortfall in income tax and GST collections. While higher proceeds from disinvestment and some tax buoyancy (towards the end of the fiscal), on account of the growth-boosting measures, can aid revenues, for now, the ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue loss appears to have left a big hole in the Centre’s kitty. The fiscal deficit target could well move up to 4 per cent (from the projected 3.3 per cent), implying additional borrowings.
Based on the Controller General of Accounts’ (CGA) provisional figures for FY19 (in which income tax grew by a modest 7 per cent), the estimated growth in income tax collections for FY20 works out to 23 per cent. For April-July, CGA data suggest that the growth in net income tax was just about 6 per cent. There is also a significant shortfall in GST collections.
The surplus transfer by the RBI as recommended by the Bimal Jalan Committee has offered a much-needed respite to the Centre in the current fiscal. Excluding the ₹28,000-crore interim dividend already paid by the RBI to the Centre last fiscal, the net transfer in the current financial year amounts to ₹1,48,051 crore. But while optically, the surplus transfer appears to be a massive figure, essentially, it is about ₹60,000 crore above what was estimated in the Budget. Hence, this additional bonanza can help make good the shortfall in tax revenues.
On the disinvestment front, the Centre has set a target of ₹1.05-lakh crore (above the ₹85,000 crore achieved the previous year), which may be achievable. But given that the Centre has been missing its target on spectrum, it is unlikely to meet its estimate of ₹50,500 crore for FY20.
On balance, before the corporate tax rate cut, the Centre could have still pulled off the 3.3 per cent (risk of missing GDP growth assumptions though remained). The substantial ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue foregone on account of the corporate tax rate cut is an additional burden for the Centre that can take its fiscal deficit target to 4 per cent levels.
The joker in the pack is still the underlying growth in the economy. While the real GDP growth has fallen from 8 per cent last year to 5 per cent this fiscal in the April-June quarter, the sharp fall in nominal GDP growth from 12.6 per cent to 8 per cent during this period is worrisome.
The Centre’s fiscal deficit target assumes a 11 per cent growth in nominal GDP growth for FY20 (from the Central Statistics Office’s FY19 estimates), which is a tall task. If growth falters further, the fiscal deficit target can even move beyond 4 per cent levels.
The biggest overhang for Indian bond markets has been the huge gross market borrowings by the Centre pegged at a high ₹7.1-lakh crore in the current fiscal (from ₹5.71-lakh crore last year). But given that the borrowing calendar has been front-loaded, the market was factoring in the easing of supply of bonds in the second half of the fiscal.
For the April-September 2019 period, issuance of government securities amounts to ₹4.42-lakh crore; the balance ₹2.68-lakh crore of gross borrowings will come in the second half. But the supply of bonds in the second half could go up now. The stimulus announced by the Centre would lead to additional borrowings, which implies more supply of bonds and higher yields (bond prices and yields are inversely related).
Going ahead with the foreign sovereign bond issuance could be a saving grace. The ₹70,000-odd crore of foreign sovereign bonds pegged in by most economists can help lower bond yields in the domestic market.
Even though the RBI cut its policy repo rate by a notable 35 basis points in its August policy, Indian bond yields have only inched up. From 6.3 per cent levels in the beginning of August, the yield on 10-year government bonds has increased to 6.6 per cent levels, already factoring in expectations of a fiscal stimulus from the Centre. Post the FM’s move on corporate tax rate, the yield has moved up by another 20 basis points.
Given that expectations of fiscal slippage has been factored into bond yields to some extent, bond yields could remain range-bound in the near term, until there is more clarity on foreign sovereign bond issuance, GST collections and the disinvestment agenda. Expectations of the RBI cutting rates further, given the sanguine inflation trends, may also cap the upside in bond yields. That said, notable rise in yields cannot be ruled out in the coming months, given the significant slip on fiscal deficit and volatile rupee.
Given the uncertainty around various factors impacting bond yields, investors must cap their expectations and tread with caution. Long-term gilt funds as a category has delivered 15-16 per cent returns over the past year, thanks to the sharp rise in bond prices. A rise in yield (fall in prices) hereon can impact returns.
Hence, investors should avoid duration and credit risk in their portfolio. A chunk of your debt fund investments should be in short-term debt funds that carry less volatility in returns. Short- and medium-duration debt funds having a duration of up to 3-4 years are ideal for investors with medium risk appetite. Opt for corporate bond funds that invest a chunk of their assets in high-rated debt instruments."

The Mukesh-Ambani firm is now the most valued company in India

Earnings growth at Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd is starting to be de-risked on the back of better refining margins, lower tax rate and cheaper gas feedstock costs, Morgan Stanley said in a note.
“Confidence in earnings should rise with higher refining margins as we count down to IMO 2020. Lower taxes and cheaper gas feed costs should de-risk outlook and boost earnings CAGR to 17 per cent F2019-21e — top quartile amongst global oil majors,” the brokerage said in the note while maintaining its stock rating of Reliance Industries at overweight.
As headwinds of the first half of 2019 turn and become key tailwinds in 2020, refining margins rise with improved demand and slower capacity growth, cheaper gas costs and improved margins from a slowdown in petrochemical capacity growth in 2020, in particular for polyethylene, supporting the rise in chemical margins and telecom subscriber adds remain steady.
“There is increased evidence of these factors playing out, which should raise investor confidence on the 17 per cent EPS growth we expect over FY2019-21,” it said.
As one of the most complex refiners, RIL should be the biggest beneficiary in Asia from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations set to start in January 2020, driving a 50 per cent plus earnings growth until FY21.
As shippers prepare for IMO, Asian refining margins have risen and diesel, which forms nearly half of RIL’s refined product output, has seen near-record high margins.
On the impact of corporate tax rate reduction, Morgan Stanley estimates “a 400bp reduction in the consolidated tax rate RIL’s businesses paid in FY2019 of 29-35 per cent, much higher than the new corporate tax rate of 25.2 per cent”. RIL also has deferred tax liabilities of $6.5 billion as of FY2019, which could reduce with a lower tax rate.
RIL’s energy earnings with a CAGR of 13 per cent over FY2019-21 is amongst the highest versus global integrated oils and Asian peers. 
With 350 basis points higher Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) than Asian energy peers and a focus on balance sheet de-leveraging, we find the valuation attractive, the brokerage said explaining the reasons for raising the price target to ₹1,469 per share in a base case scenario from ₹1,349.
“One of the interesting things in the Morgan Stanley report is a bullish case scenario of ₹2,000 a share based on five specific assumptions, all of which looks feasible,” an analyst said.
These five assumptions include slow refining capacity additions, leading to 30 per cent higher margins than in base case, 10 per cent higher chemical division margins as paraxylene supply surprises on the downside, 6-8 per cent CAGR in telecom ARPU, progress on asset monetization and 10 per cent above mid-cycle multiple.
Morgan Stanley said it is “more bullish on Reliance Industries”. “The bullish scenario shows that Saudi Aramco has got a great deal,” the analyst said.
In August, Ambani announced that Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Saudi Aramco), the world’s largest oil producer, will buy a 20 per cent stake in the oil to chemicals business of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) for $15 billion, pegging the enterprise value of the Mukesh Ambani-led company’s most valuable business division at $75 billion."
53,2019-09-29,Reliance,"Weekly trading guide










 
SBI opened the week strongly at ₹307.5 against the previous close of ₹301.7, up nearly 2 per cent. The stock appreciated further to a high of ₹316, briefly trading above the 50-day moving average. However, the stock reversed abruptly as it could not sustain the bullish momentum and the price began to decline, breaking below the key supports at ₹300 and ₹292.
Thus, the near-term outlook seems weak as rallies are sold-off. The relative strength index has dipped below the 50-mark, indicating weakness. On the downside, supports are at ₹273.7 and ₹267. Resistances are at ₹292 and ₹300. The next leg of trend can be expected only if the stock price breaks either to ₹300 or ₹267.
In case it goes above ₹300, the stock will face a hurdle at the resistance band between ₹305.1 and ₹307.6, beyond which it may potentially retest the ₹316 levels. But if the stock breaks below ₹267, the sell-off could intensify and the stock will most likely tumble to ₹260. The return last week was minus 6.2 per cent.










 
The stock price of ITC took a huge leap as it opened the week at ₹250 against the previous close of ₹238.05, which is a solid 5 per cent gain. It extended the rally and went on to make a high of ₹260.5. However, the stock could not move beyond that level and the price started to soften and slumped to ₹242.7, from where it bounced off from the 21-day moving average support.
Studying the chart, one can observe that the stock is consolidating sideways as the price oscillates in the band between ₹247 and the resistance band ₹258-260. If the stock manages to breach the upper limit of the range at ₹260, it is likely that it will appreciate towards ₹270 levels, beyond which there’s an immediate resistance at ₹273.
However, if the stock weakens and slides below the lower limit of the range, that is, ₹247, the price may depreciate to ₹240, below which it can even drop to ₹234 levels. Last week’s return was plus 6.5 per cent.










 
Infosys witnessed considerable selling immediately after the previous week opened. As a result, it tumbled below the key level at ₹800. A stronger rupee weighed down the stock. The fall extended to ₹741.9 before the stock recouped some if its losses, closing the week at ₹782.
Recoveries are strongly resisted by the price band between ₹793 and ₹800. Hence, the near-term outlook remains weak. It has also moved below the 50-day moving average, potentially shifting the medium-term trend to bearish. The RSI has dipped below the 50 midpoint and the moving average convergence divergence indicator too appears weak. So, if the scrip weakens below ₹781, it will most likely depreciate to ₹762.
A break below that level can intensify the bearish trend and the stock could dwindle to ₹725 levels. Alternatively, if the stock manages to post a recovery beyond the stiff resistance at ₹800, there will be a minor resistance at ₹814, beyond which it might move northwards to ₹850 levels over the medium term.










 
Following the bullish momentum, the stock price of Reliance Industries continued to gain throughout last week. The stock toppled the key resistance at ₹1,300, making the case stronger for further appreciation. The relative strength index is clearly favouring the bulls and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has come into the positive territory, denoting a strong prevailing uptrend.
Also, the stock price has broken above the falling trend-line resistance. The stock has posted gains for two consecutive weeks. All these imply that the stock is on a strong bull trend and is likely to continue appreciating in the coming sessions.
On the upside, the stock will face a minor resistance at ₹1,320, beyond which it could strengthen to ₹1,365 levels in the near term. On the other hand, if the stock undergoes a correction, ₹1,300 will act as a key immeidate support, below which the price could fall to ₹1,240 in the short term. The return last week was plus 4.4 per cent.










 
The share price of Tata Steel was consolidating last week, fluctuating between ₹360 and ₹380. Though the stock attempted to move past ₹380, it failed, as it was rejected by the 50-day moving average. Thus, the broader ₹345-380 range continues to control the trend.
The moving average convergence divergence indicator implies weakness and so is the relative strength index. But since the RSI remains in over-sold conditions, the chances of a major downtrend from the current levels stand reduced. But unless the stock invalidates the range, the direction of the next major trend will be indecisive. Hence, the near-term outlook seems sluggish.
If the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range, it may rise towards the resistance band between ₹395 and ₹400. Beyond those levels, it can move upwards to ₹440. But, if the stock breaches below ₹345, the support is at ₹330, below which the stock could test the psychological level of ₹300."

51,2019-09-30,Reliance,"Domestic gas price cut by 12.5 per cent to $3.23 a unit 
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has lowered the price of domestically produced natural gas to $ 3.23 per million British thermal unit (mBtu). This price will be applicable from October 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.  The new price is 12.5 per cent lower than the $ 3.69 mBtu natural gas price for the April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019 period. 
The ceiling price allowed for gas to be produced from difficult fields has also been lowered to $ 8.43 a mBtu from $ 9.32 a mBtu. Domestic natural gas price in the country is governed as per the New Domestic Gas policy, 2014. 
Commenting on the impact of this cut, a CARE Ratings statement said, “As per our estimates, a 12.5 per cent fall in natural gas prices could potentially lead to a 6 per cent decrease in cost of production of urea, thus decreasing the working capital intensity of the fertiliser manufacturers and also acting as a relief for the fiscal spending of the government while disbursing the urea subsidy.” 
CARE Ratings also said that a lowered gas price could deter investments in domestic production. The ratings agency said, “Upstream oil and gas exploration companies will not benefit with the decrease in gas prices as it will lead to low earnings due to decline in per unit realisations in the natural gas segment. This could potentially discourage upstream companies to take up domestic gas exploration.”"

SBI in a strong bear grip (₹249.9)
The stock posted some recovery in the month of September by appreciating to ₹315 levels. However, the rally did not sustain, and the stock fell sharply from that level. During the past week, the price even slumped below a critical support at ₹267 and closed at ₹249.9, indicating that the next leg of trend is on the downside. The stock has been continuously falling and has registered back-to-back weekly loss. The daily relative strength index is below the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has entered the negative territory, meaning there might be more selling pressure. An immediate support is at ₹246. Below that, the sell-off could intensify, potentially dragging the price to the support band between ₹230 and ₹233. On the upside, the stock will face resistance at ₹260. If the stock manages to get past that level, it might move towards ₹267. Considering the scenario, traders can sell the stock on rallies with a stop-loss above ₹267. The stock posted a weekly loss of 11 per cent.
 










 
ITC holds on to its gain (₹257.2)
There was not much volatility in the ITC stock last week. The stock briefly traded beyond the ₹247-260 range, but eventually moved back into the range after facing a hurdle at ₹263 — 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bear trend. The stock has closed in the green for the second week in a row, though the gain was marginal. It should also be noted that the stock continues to trade above both the 21- and 50-day moving averages, implying a bullish bias. The daily relative strength index is above the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence indicator looks steady in favour of the bulls. The stock seems to be trading with a bullish bias. However, the price might soften further before breaking on the upside. Hence, one can initiate long positions either at ₹250 levels or beyond ₹260 with a stop-loss below the lower boundary of the range at ₹247. Look for target between ₹270 and ₹273, which is a considerable resistance zone. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1.7 per cent.
 










 
Infosys moves in sideways range (₹793.4)
The price action of Infosys stock is sluggish and seems to be trading sideways. The stock attempted to break above the critical resistance at ₹800 but failed . Noticeably, the price has been oscillating between ₹781 and ₹800 for the past seven trading sessions. Also, it could not move past the dynamic 50-day moving average resistance which is currently coinciding with the resistance at ₹800, making it more significant. Unless the stock invalidates the sideways trend, the next leg of the trend will be unclear. The moving average convergence divergence indicator is showing signs of weakness, but the relative strength index seems to be recovering. However, only a breakout beyond ₹800 will take the stock price higher. If it gets past ₹800, it will face a minor resistance at ₹814. Above that, the price could rally towards ₹850 . Alternatively, if stock price dips below ₹781, it will decline further to ₹762. A break below ₹762 will intensify sell-off and the stock price could dwindle to ₹740 level. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1.4 per cent.
 










 
Reliance above key support (₹1,308.1)
The share price of Reliance Industries did not change much compared to the previous week and witnessed low volatility. The opening price and closing price were at the same level, meaning a doji candlestick in the weekly chart. It denotes a temporary indecisiveness on the direction of the trend during the past week. However, the bullish trend in the stock looks solid and as long as it trades above the key support at ₹1,300, the chances for price moving northwards is high. There is no weakness observed in the relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator seems to be steady. Hence, any correction in price can be used as an opportunity to initiate long positions. It is likely to move up to ₹1,365 and ₹1,400 levels, testing the life-time high of the stock. Stop-loss can be set below the immediate support at ₹1,300, because if the stock undergoes a correction, that level will perhaps arrest the decline. Below that level, subsequent support can be seen at ₹1,240.
 










 
Tata Steel poised to decline further (₹333.1)
Tata Steel witnessed selling pressure last week and the price broke below the lower boundary of the ₹345-380 range that had been holding the stock for the past three weeks. The break down opens the door for further weakness in the stock. It has pierced below the 21-day moving average as well. The daily relative strength index stays below the mid-point level of 50, where the moving average convergence divergence indicator is in the negative territory. All this could indicate that the stock might attract more selling pressure in upcoming trading sessions. Even though the stock currently hovers around a support at ₹330, traders with short-term and medium-term perspective can sell it on rallies. Below that level, the price will most probably depreciate to the psychological level of ₹300 in the short term. The support comes in at ₹280 levels. However, if the stock moves up from the current levels, rallies could be capped between ₹345 and ₹360. It posted a weekly loss of 7.3 per cent."

 In a setback to the Oil Ministry, the Supreme Court has dismissed its petition against an order seeking disclosure of documents that formed basis for levy of $3-billion penalty on Reliance Industries over KG-D6 natural gas output not matching targets.
 A three-member international arbitration panel, hearing Reliance and its partner’s challenge to the government levying penalty because of un-utilised capacity due to production not matching targets, had asked the Ministry to share an array of documents that formed basis for its actions.
 The Oil Ministry first challenged the disclosure before the Delhi High Court, which on December 18, 2018 dismissed the petition. It then challenged it in the Supreme Court, which on August 5, 2019 dismissed it saying it was “not inclined to interfere” with the earlier order.
The government had between 2012 and 2016 disallowed Reliance and its partners from recovering the cost of $3.02 billion for KG-D6 output lagging targets. The penalty in form of disallowance of recovery of certain costs was levied because the Oil Ministry and its technical arm DGH felt that the output lagged targets because the company did not drill the committed number of wells on the fields and created excess capacity.
 Sources said a three-member arbitration panel, constituted in 2015 to hear Reliance and its partner BP’s challenge to disallowance of cost recovery, had asked the Oil Ministry to share a host of documents, including those “sent, received or created” that “set out the reasons” for the government decision.
 Reliance and BP believe that there is no provision under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) signed for the KG-D6 block awarded to them under the first bid round of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) of targets for oil and gas production and disallowing cost if they are not met.
 Under NELP, contractors are first allowed to recover all their sunk cost before sharing profits with the government. Disallowing a part of the cost would not just result in contractors having to absorb those expenses but also result in higher profit share from oil and gas produced to the government. The government claimed an additional $175 million as its profit share after the cost disallowance in 2016.
 The arbitration panel agreed to most of the 19 requests made by Reliance-BP for disclosure of documents by the government. These included one for “disclosure of earlier formal but unpublished guidelines in effect between 1997 to October 2007 concerning the classification and/or recovery of general and administrative costs incurred by contractors under NELP PSC”.
 The other requests of Reliance-BP granted by the arbitration panel included the Ministry disclosing “July 2011 response to an enquiry from the government auditor (CAG)”, documents reasoning out decision not to approve revised field development plan that set out reasons for lower output in October 2013 and ones pertaining to the position the Ministry took on drilling of development wells.
 Reliance-BP say the output in KG-D6 block plummeted because of unforseen reservoir characteristics, including sand and water ingress in wells.
 Sources said the arbitration panel also granted Reliance-BP request for disclosure of documents that led to the ministry’s representative of KG-D6 block oversight panel to deny approval of work programmes and budget for the block in 2011-12 and 2012-13.
 The Delhi High Court in its December 2018 order stated that the arbitration panel has “after examining the requests for discovery directed, wherever necessary, discovery of documents, both by the Union of India and the respondents/contractors (Reliance-BP)” following “the principles of natural justice”.
 The Oil Ministry opposed such disclosure over confidentiality and other secrecy clauses.
 The court said that the arbitration panel had “correctly kept in mind the provisions” of the arbitration law requiring it to “treat the parties equally and give each party a full opportunity to present its case“.
 “Therefore, in my view, if the argument advanced on behalf of the Union of India is accepted, it will stymie the arbitration proceedings; a situation which will enure to the benefit of a recalcitrant party which does not desire a quick resolution of the dispute,” Justice Rajiv Shakdher wrote in the December 18, 2018 order dismissing the Oil Ministry appeal.
 Gas production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas field in the KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal was supposed to be 80 million standard cubic meters per day but actual production was only 35.33 mmscmd in 2011-12, 20.88 mmscmd in 2012-13 and 9.77 mmscmd in 2013-14 - the years for which the over USD 3 billion penalty was levied. The output has continued to drop in the subsequent years and is now below 2 mmscmd.
 Reliance holds 66.6 per cent interest in block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 in the Bay of Bengal. BP has the rest."

Reliance Industries will pay for Venezuelan crude oil via exports of diesel in a barter arrangement as it resumed taking supplies from the US sanctions-hit Latin American nation after a gap of four months.
Although US oil sanctions imposed on Venezuela in January 2019 have no direct secondary component, oil companies such as Reliance Industries (RIL) that have a significant US presence have curtailed their commercial ties with the OPEC nation.
Read more: US sanctions Venezuelan state oil firm, escalating pressure on Maduro
Reliance had, in March, capped oil purchases from the Latin American nation and halted selling diluents. “RIL has been supplying permitted products like diesel to Venezuela and, hence, is able to recommence crude sourcing. These are actions compliant to US-sanctions as crude sourcing against the supply of permitted products is allowed,” a company spokesperson said.
Following US sanctions, companies had shunned direct purchases in favour of secondary market sourcing through Russia’s state-controlled Rosneft, which is now the primary supplier of Venezuelan oil. US President Donald Trump had, in January, slapped oil sanctions on Venezuela in a bid to put pressure on its socialist President Maduro to step down.
The sanctions, however, do not ban importing crude oil from Venezuela, but barred supply from the US of the diluents that must be blended with the extra-heavy oil from Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt so it could flow through pipelines.
RIL, which operates twin refineries with a capacity to process 1.36 million barrels per day of crude oil at Jamnagar in Gujarat, had a contract to buy around three million barrels of crude oil from Venezuela a month, which was reduced to about two million barrels by March 2019.
Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, has been placed on the US Treasury Department’s Specially Designated Nationals List, which generally prohibits American citizens from dealing with named firms or individuals. This has resulted in international banks and shipping companies as well as Reliance ceasing any transactions. These restrictions come into force on March 29 after an eight-week winding down period for contracts that were already in effect.
In March, RIL had stated that its US subsidiary has completely stopped all business with Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, and its global parent has not increased crude purchases. “In addition, since sanctions were imposed and contrary to some news reports, Reliance has halted all supply of diluents to PDVSA and will not resume such sales until sanctions are lifted,” it had stated.

Oil from the Orinoco needs to be diluted with lighter grades to reduce its viscosity so as to allow its flow through pipelines to the coast for export or processing. Besides Reliance, Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy is the primary buyer of Venezuelan oil in India, because their advanced refining systems can process the thick Venezuelan grade into high-value fuels such as gasoline, low-sulfur diesel and jet fuel.
Venezuela shipped around 3,08,000 barrels per day of crude during January-August to India."

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has re-started crude imports from sanctions-hit Venezuela after a four-month gap, using its diesel exports to the Latin American nation to settle the crude purchase bill.
Reliance, India’s biggest private refiner, said the barter arrangement complies with the US sanctions on the OPEC member.
“RIL has been supplying permitted products like diesel to Venezuela and hence is able to recommence crude sourcing. These are actions compliant to US sanctions as crude sourcing against supply of permitted products is allowed,” a Reliance Industries spokesperson said in an e-mailed response to Business Line, disclosing the crude quantities sourced from Venezuela. 
The barter deal will help ease Venezuela's inventories after US sanctions left PDVSA with huge volumes of unsold crude.

Reliance Industries would be the first Indian company to reach $200-billion market cap in 24 months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Wednesday. Currently, RIL commands a market cap of $122 billion.
The foreign fund and advisory firm has reiterated its buy rating on RIL with a price target of ₹1,615. Bull-bear analysis shows risk-reward skewed with 36 per cent CAGR upside from the current market price in bull-case scenario and a 17-per cent downside in bear-case in 24 months, the research firm said. 
In a report, BofA-ML said, its analysis indicates that incrementally three transformational drivers — new commerce venture, fixed broadband business and digital initiatives — could add $55-billion enterprise value for the company. 
RIL’s new commerce initiative is looking to empower kiranas in unorganised retail market, it said and added the comany’s entry in SME enterprise space where its tie-up with Microsoft and attractive pricing ($22/month) could entice uptake. Besides, Jio’s fibre broadband business where it could leverage Den/Hathway’s networks to drive India’s current low-fibre broadband penetration of 6 per cent, it further said. 
Also, digital initiatives like advertising, lending along with SME/broadband could add $22-billion incremental value, BofA research said. 
“We think the market is giving little credit to these initiatives given limited visibility. We expect near-term momentum to be strong, led by IMO 2020 implementation and continued share gains in telco and retail business. Additional $17 billion could be added in bull-case scenario led by better-than-expected cellular tariff hikes/better GRM due to IMO.”"

BL15_IT_JIO




BL15_IT_JIO




Reliance Jio has accused Airtel, Vodafone Idea and BSNL of masquerading wireline numbers as mobile numbers. Jio has alleged that the incumbent operators are doing this to get higher interconnect usage charges.
Every time a Jio user calls a mobile subscriber on another operator’s network, Jio has to pay interconnect fee to that operator. Jio has alleged that by showing a wireline number as mobile connection, the incumbent operators are taking a higher termination charge.
“The incumbent operators have implemented a process, under which various enterprises are offered mobile numbers as their customer care/helpline numbers. Some of the popular examples are like 8888888888 by Just Dial, 9313931393 by Oyo, 9115691156 by Videocon D2H etc. In all these cases, the mobile number is used just as a virtual number for routing all such calls to respective call centre set-ups of these organisations operating on wire-line PRIs with hunting facilities.”Jio said in a letter to the TRAI.
Thus, even when the calling party is dialling the mobile number, all such calls are actually terminating on the fixed lines without ever touching the radio access network of the terminating operator. Thus, the underlying wireline numbers are being deliberately and fraudulently masqueraded with the published mobile numbers by the incumbent operators,” it added.
Jio alleged that this implementation is in gross violation of the Interconnection Usage Charges (IUC) Regulations 2003 issued by TRAI and as amended from time to time, which prescribes separate termination charges for calls terminating on wireless and wireline numbers and the current prevailing per minute termination charges are 6 paise and 0 paise respectively. Hence, this implementation of masquerading the wireline number with mobile numbers is a case of deliberate and fraudulent attempt made by incumbent operators to illegally extract mobile termination charge of 6 paise/minute from originating operator, whereas in reality the call is getting terminated on wireline network.
Jio allegations come after Airtel's claimed that Jio was disconnecting calls after a short ring duration to game the IUC system. 
This part of the ongoing battle between Jio and Airtel on whether IUC should be reduced to zero or increased to 14 paise from 6 paise now."

ITC Ltd, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries, and others from India Inc, have listed out their investment plans for Madhya Pradesh at the investor summit.
While ITC plans to set up a modern food processing centre at a total investment of Rs 700 crore, Sun Pharma is looking to expand its two manufacturing facilities in the states. Reliance Industries said it would double the number of petrol pumps and retail outlets in Madhya Pradesh, besides setting up 45 logistic centres in the State.
In his recorded video message, played during the Magnificent Madhya Pradesh Investors’ Summit here, Reliance’s Chairman Mukesh Ambani said the company has invested over Rs 20,000 crore in the State during the last few years. It has created large-scale employment and emerged the second largest employer after the State Government. It has developed coal bed methane plants in the state and built the first and only gas pipeline that connects it with the national gas grid. This has opened up multiple investment opportunities. He said Jio has become the greatest catalyst for transforming MP into a digital society. Today, MP alone consumes more data than South Korea, the UK, France, Germany or Canada.
Talking about the future, he said the company has over 600 stores and 100 petroleum retail outlets in the State. “We will have more than double these numbers in the coming years. The new commerce initiatives of Reliance Retail will benefit tens of thousands of kirana stores and small merchants,” he announced, while adding that the state is a natural choice for a logistics hub because of its strategic location.
“Reliance will be setting up national distribution centres in MP, with over 10 million sq ft of space across 45 locations,” he said. Further, Reliance will also explore investment opportunities in the renewable energy sector to promote sustainable development and the green economy.
Later, addressing the gathering, Sanjiv Puri, Chairman and Managing Director of ITC, announced the setting up of a new food processing plant in the State. “Land is with us. Design work is going on and we expect production to commence soon,” he said. Besides producing all the famous brands, including ‘Ashirwad’ and ‘Bingo,’ the plant would de-hydrate locally sourced vegetables, to be sent across the country.
The company sources a large quantity of wheat from Madhya Pradesh, which produces among the finest qualities of the crop, such as ‘Sarbati.’ The company is also working on enhancing the farmer’s realisation and will focus on strengthening the agriculture value chain and irrigation storage facilities. The company also aims to encourage horticulture in the state.
Sun Pharma’s Dilip Sanghvi said his company has so far invested over Rs 500 crore in the state. Though, Sun did not have its own manufacturing units in the State, post the takeover of Ranbaxy’s assets in the State, it has two manufacturing units, Dewas and Mallanpur. “We are looking to expand these facilities,” he said.
India Cement’s N. Srinivasan said work on new cement and grinding plants in the State is in progress . However, his only ‘complaint’ was that his company has not been able to keep up with the State Government’s pace in approvals and permission.

The consolidated net profit of Reliance Industries Ltd, the oil to telecom conglomerate owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, rose 18.3 per cent in the July-September quarter to ₹11,262 crore from a year ago, as revenue from operations jumped 4.8 per cent to ₹1,63,854 crore. The consolidated net profit was ₹9,516 crore on an operational revenue of ₹1,56,291 crore in the second quarter of FY19.
Reliance Industries said the quarterly consolidated revenue was driven mainly by robust growth in retail and digital services businesses, which grew by 27 per cent and 34 per cent respectively. This helped partially offset the drop in revenue in the refining and petrochemicals businesses.
“The results reflect benefits of our integrated oil to chemicals value chain and the rapid scale-up of our consumer businesses,” said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries.
The company’s consumer businesses now account for 33 per cent of the EBITDA, which grew by 15.5 per cent to ₹25,820 crore from ₹22,359 crore a year ago.
Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL, has posted a net profit of ₹990 crore in the quarter under review, a 45.4 per cent rise from ₹681 crore recorded during the same quarter a year ago. The company’s standalone revenue from operations rose 33.7 per cent to ₹12,354 crore (₹9,240 crore).
The company’s EBITDA rose to 44.6 per cent to ₹5,166 crore (₹3,573 crore) with a 41.8 per cent margin. However, it’s average revenue per user (ARPU) fell to ₹120 per subscriber per month from ₹122 recorded in sequential June quarter. RJio lost about ₹652 crore during the quarter to interconnect user charges (IUC), while it incurred a capex of ₹5,000 crore during the quarter, Anshuman Thakur, Head of Strategy and Planning at RJio, said.
Earlier this month, RJio had decided to charge 6 paise per minute of IUC from its customers for off-net calls. “We see this benefiting margins in the October-December quarter,” he said.
RJio added 103 million users in the last 12 months, taking its total subscriber base to over 350 million.
The company’s revenue from refining and marketing business dropped by 1.6 per cent to ₹97,229 crore from ₹98,760 crore a year ago, reflecting lower crude prices.
The gross refining margin fell marginally to $9.4 per barrel from $9.5 per barrel a year ago. The GRM for the second quarter, though, was the highest in the last four quarters. The crude throughput fell to 16.7 million metric tonnes from 17.7 mmt a year ago. The petrochemicals business reported a 11.9 per cent drop in revenue to ₹38,538 crore from ₹43,745 crore in the second quarter of FY19. The throughput in petrochemicals rose to 9.9 mmt, the highest ever, from 9.4 mmt a year earlier."

Reliance Industries (RIL) became India’s first company to hit a market capitalisation of ₹9-lakh crore. Expectations around the company’s telecom operations and bullish sentiment given the company’s impending stake-sale deal with the world’s largest oil company Saudi Aramco have been driving the stock over the past few weeks.
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT company, is the second most valued in the stock market having reached a capitalisation of ₹8.61-lakh crore. HDFC Bank’s m-cap stood at around ₹7-lakh crore, making it the third most valued company.
In August, RIL was downgraded by Credit Suisse with a price target of ₹995 on the back of higher leverage worries. But the stock has seen a stellar rise in its price and touched a high of ₹1,428 by gaining nearly 2 per cent on Friday. The rise has been largely driven by the company’s efforts to become debt-free by March 31, 2021.
Recently, RIL had announced sale of 20 per cent stake in its oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco at an enterprise value of $75 billion, making it one of the biggest foreign direct investment (FDI) deals in the country.
It also announced a deal with BP, wherein the UK-based company will acquire 49 per cent stake in RIL’s retail distribution business. The commitments from these two transactions are about ₹1.1-lakh crore.
 
RIL had ended last year with net debt of ₹1,54,478 crore. On the telecom front, Reliance Jio has announced entry into the fixed broadband segment even as it increased tariffs for mobile voice calls.
As the stock continued its rally post these announcements, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoFAML), on October 16, said that in the next 24 months, RIL can become India’s first company to reach the $200-billion market-cap milestone.
This means that BoFAML is now predicting that RIL’s market-cap can rise to around ₹14-lakh crore, a near 50 per cent rise in the stock price from the current levels."
38,2019-10-19,Reliance,"Reliance Industries: Retail, digital lead the way 


Lower crude oil prices, lesser refinery throughput and a dip in gross refining margin (to $9.4 from $9.5 a barrel) dragged down the refining segment.




Lower crude oil prices, lesser refinery throughput and a dip in gross refining margin (to $9.4 from $9.5 a barrel) dragged down the refining segment.


For Reliance Industries (RIL), the September 2019 quarter was an encore of the June 2019 quarter, with the digital and retail segments more than offsetting the weakness in the core hydrocarbon businesses of refining and petrochemicals. RIL’s consolidated quarterly profit of ₹11,262 crore in the September 2019 quarter, up about 18 per cent y-o-y, was driven by sharp jumps in operating profit in the retail and digital businesses (up about 63 per cent each). In contrast, the operating profit in the refining and petrochemicals businesses was down 6-7 per cent y-o-y.
Lower crude oil prices, lesser refinery throughput and a dip in gross refining margin (to $9.4 from $9.5 a barrel) dragged down the refining segment.
Fall in the prices and sharp dip in margins of some products took a toll on the petrochemicals segment. Among other factors, the weakness in the global economy reflected in the performance of these cyclical businesses.
But bucking the overall consumption slowdown in the domestic economy, RIL’s retail business continued its strong growth momentum, aided by store additions (337), higher same-store sales and improved margins. The digital business gained from continued strong subscriber growth with net addition of 24 million subscribers during the quarter.
With nearly 10,900 stores and 355 million subscribers, as of September 2019, RIL’s retail and digital businesses have bolstered their leadership positions. The recent introduction of 6 paise per minute as interconnect usage charges for outgoing calls to other networks should aid the financial performance of RJio in the coming quarters.
While marginal contributors to the overall bottomline, the media business posted a profit in the September quarter, aided by growth in subscription income, while the oil and gas (exploration) segment pared losses. Overall profit was also aided by interest income more than doubling in the September quarter to about ₹2,500 crore.
More than the financial performance, the September 2019 quarter is significant for the big-ticket stake sales announced by RIL during the period. In particular, the deal to sell 20 per cent stake in the refining and petrochemicals businesses to Saudi Aramco should fetch RIL about $15 billion.
This should help the company deleverage its balance-sheet significantly, and further reduce dependence on the hydrocarbons business in line with its stated strategy.
The market seems optimistic about RIL’s growth prospects including its recently launched Jio Fibre service and e-commerce and new commerce plans. The stock has scaled an all-time high and its market capitalisation is within kissing distance of ₹9 lakh crore."

After a subdued opening, the stock of SBI rallied in the end of last week and broke out of the range between ₹246 and ₹262. The price is testing the 21-day moving average which falls at around ₹270. The daily relative strength index indicates a bullish divergence and the moving average convergence divergence indicator, too, shows an uptick.
The short-term outlook of the stock is bullish, which could lead it higher to ₹275 level, a resistance that coincides with the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bear trend.
Above that level, the medium-term trend of the stock will turn bullish and attract more buyers, which could lift the price to ₹290 in the coming sessions.
Above that ₹300 — a psychological level — is the next hurdle. On the other hand, if stock cannot hold on to the bullish momentum and the price corrects, the supports will be at ₹262 and ₹267. The stock posted a weekly gain of nearly 6 per cent.










The stock price of ITC traded sluggish the past week trading in a tight range between ₹243 and ₹247. After a significant fall in the preceding week, the stock could not post a recovery and was resisted strongly at ₹247. Since the major trend is bearish, the stock will have difficulty breaking out of that level.
The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator is flat and do not indicate any bias. The price of ₹247 is also coincides with the 50-day moving average, and the 21-day moving average lies at ₹249, making the price area between ₹247 and ₹249 a significant resistance zone.
Since the stock has formed a good base at ₹243, it is not recommended to approach the stock with a negative bias. If the price breaches either ₹243 or ₹249. A breakout will result in the stock moving towards ₹253, whereas a break-down will result in the stock declining to the previous low of ₹234. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1 per cent.










After breaking out of the range between ₹780 and ₹800 on the upside, Infosys opened the week significantly lower. But further decline in the price was arrested by a support at ₹760, coincided by the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous uptrend. Importantly, the 21-day moving average has gone below the 50-day moving average, suggesting the possibility of the medium-term trend becoming bearish.
A significant weakness is observed in the moving average convergence divergence indicator. One can also observe a head- and-shoulders pattern in the daily chart, which is an indication of trend reversal. A close below ₹760 on a daily basis will confirm the pattern and result in the stock tumbling to ₹673, as projected by the pattern. Noticeably, the stock has a support at ₹725.
On the other hand, if the stock takes support at ₹760 and moves up, it will face a hurdles at ₹780 and at ₹800. The stock posted a weekly loss of 5.8 per cent.










The stock of Reliance Industries had a muted start as it traded flat during the first half. In the latter half, the stock resumed its stellar rally and marked a new life-time high of ₹1,427.9 on Friday. With a close at ₹1,416.3, it has breached the ₹1,400 mark and could potentially trigger the next leg of uptrend in the coming days.
The daily relative strength index has entered the over-bought territory, but the price action looks steady. The moving average convergence divergence indicator suggests considerable upward momentum. The medium-term trend of the stock is strongly bullish, and it can be bought on dips. On the upside, the stock has the potential to climb to ₹1,485, beyond which it will face a resistance at ₹1,500.
However, if the stock is subject to a correction on the back of profit-booking, ₹1,400 will offer a strong support. On further correction, a less likely scenario, the stock will find support at ₹1,365. The stock posted a weekly gain of 4.7 per cent.










The stock price of Tata steel rose last week after taking support at ₹340 levels. However, it stopped short of breaking the resistance at ₹360. But the price has closed above the 21- and 50-day moving averages, thereby raising the possibility of further ascent.
The daily relative strength index has crossed the midpoint level of 50 and one can also spot a bullish divergence, making the case stronger for the bulls. The moving average convergence divergence is also showing an uptick.
The current closing level is a resistance, and if the stock manages to break out and appreciate as a result of buying interest, it could advance to ₹380 in the coming days, beyond which it will face a hindrance in the form of a resistance band between ₹395 and ₹400. Alternatively, if the stock obeys the resistance at ₹360 and declines, it will decline to ₹345, below which the support is at ₹330. The stock posted a weekly return of about 6 per cent."

RIL Chairman, Mukesh Ambani




RIL Chairman, Mukesh Ambani


In a move that will make Reliance Jio practically debt-free, its parent Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), is setting up a wholly-owned subsidiary for its digital initiatives, with a total capital infusion of ₹1.73-lakh crore.
Under this arrangement, ₹1,08,000 crore of RJio’s liabilities will be transferred to RIL. The new company will house all of RIL’s digital entities including RJio and other technology-based initiatives in education, healthcare and agriculture services.
RIL will make an equity infusion of ₹1.08-lakh crore through a rights issue. The new subsidiary will also acquire ₹65,000 crore of equity held by RIL in RJio.
“This new company will be a truly transformational and disruptive digital services platform. It will bring together India’s No 1 connectivity platform, leading digital app ecosystem and the world’s best tech capabilities, to create a truly digital society for each Indian,” said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of RIL, in a statement.
The move enables RIL to unlock value in its digital properties either through strategic divestments or through public listing of shares. “Given the reach and scale of our digital ecosystem, we have received strong interest from potential strategic partners. We will induct the right partners in our platform company, creating and unlocking meaningful value for RIL shareholders,” Ambani added.
The new company will be the umbrella firm for MyJio (selfcare app), JioTV (live TV app), JioCinema, JioNews (news app) and JioSaavn (music app), among others.
It will also focus on healthcare, education, agriculture, commerce, government-to-citizen services, gaming and manufacturing, among others, said the statement.
Following the move, RJio will become a net debt-free company by March 31, 2020. However, it will still have spectrum liabilities.
This will not have any impact on the value pre- and post-reorganisation for shareholders, the consolidated debt of RIL, and RIL’s standalone credit profile, the company said.
This is more bad news for incumbent players Airtel and Vodafone Idea, who are struggling under massive debt.
The entire debt of the telecom industry is around ₹4-lakh crore. In addition, the latest ruling by the Supreme Court puts an additional burden of ₹1.3-lakh crore on the incumbent operators.
RJio on the other hand, with a debt-free balance sheet, looks to have the upper hand for now.

35,2019-10-28,Reliance,"RIL’s new arm for digital initiatives could facilitate early monetisation


Reliance Industries Ltd’s move to set up a wholly-owned subsidiary for its digital initiatives, with a capital infusion of ₹1.73-lakh crore, could facilitate early monetisation in the new company.
“Coming after Reliance Jio Infocomm’s (RJio) capex cycle easing down, this debt-free structure could facilitate early monetisation including inducting strategic and financial investors in Jio Platforms Ltd (JPL),” according to a note by Emkay Global.
In his AGM, RIL had mentioned of interests from potential partners.
“Both JPL and RJio would be debt-free, in line with its global technology peers. RJio will only have spectrum-related liabilities (₹25,000 crore), CPs (₹23,000 crore) and some working capital liabilities,” it added.

34,2019-10-30,Reliance,"At $131.63 bn, RIL overtakes BP Plc in market capitalisation 


Reliance Industries on Wednesday overtook BP Plc in terms of market capitalisation. RIL's market-cap currently stands at $131.635 billion against BP's $129.9 billion. While RIL's market-cap has climbed from $80.245 billion at the end of 2018, BP's has only moved up marginally from $127.054 billion.
The share price of Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries hit a year-high of ₹1,480 on the NSE on Wednesday and is hovering around ₹1,471.90. In early trade on the London Stock Exchange, the BP stock climbed 0.69 per cent to £495.95.
It must, however, be noted that the two stocks are not strictly comparable, as Reliance is a more diversified player with retail and telecom verticals, while BP remains a pure-play energy company.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2019, RIL clocked revenues of ₹163,854 crore ($23.1 billion), an increase of 4.8 per cent compared to ₹156,291 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the robust growth in the retail and digital services businesses. The two segments, which grew 27 per cent and 43 per cent, respectively, offset the drop in refining and petrochemicals segment revenues post the 17.7 per cent fall in Brent crude price.
Read also: RIL Q2 profit up 18.3% at ₹11,262 crore
BP posted a sharp drop in third-quarter profit, according to numbers released on October 29. Its net income slumped 40 per cent from a year ago to $2.3 billion. Excluding the $2.6 billion raised from the sale of some assets would push BP into its first quarterly loss since 2016.
In contrast, Reliance Industries has been going from strength to strength. Earlier this year, it re-entered the elite club of Top-100 market cap companies after a decade. Tata Consultancy Services, for the first time, entered the club.
""India rejoined the Global Top 100 market-cap club for the first time since 2009, with the return of Reliance Industries, as well as a new entry, Tata Consultancy Services. Both companies’ market capitalisation increased due to robust earnings growth coupled with the overall strong domestic market performance,"" PwC said in a study after compiling the data for the period ended March 31, 2019.
After RIL's Q2 performance, Kotak Securities said the results were broadly in line with its expectations as higher Jio/retail contribution and other income mitigated the weakness in the downstream oil business. ""Effective net debt has now peaked with rising cash profits covering for declining capex. Near-term refining strength amid IMO (International Maritime Organization) implementation, progress on deleveraging roadmap and accelerated the rollout of (Fibre to the home) FTTH/new commerce may augur well. We reiterate BUY rating on the stock with a revised FV of ₹1,550 (₹1,425 earlier),"" it added."

The stock of SBI climbed throughout the past week, crossing an important level of ₹300; it even registered a 13-week high of ₹317.8 on Thursday. Noticeably, it has moved past ₹309, the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. After closing at ₹313.5, the stock is currently trading at a resistance in the band between ₹309 and ₹315. But the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator continue to indicate a bullish bias and the medium-term outlook of the stock is positive. So, with the current momentum, the stock will most likely break out of ₹315 and move up towards ₹335. Note that before ₹335, the stock could face a minor resistance at ₹324, the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. A daily close above ₹315 will confirm a higher peak, which could reinforce the existing bullish momentum. On the other hand, if the stock undergoes a correction on profit-booking, it has supports at ₹300 and ₹292. The stock has returned an impressive 15.3 per cent for October.
 










 
The stock of ITC gained during the past week after facing a sell-off in the week before. The stock currently faces strong resistance at ₹263 – also substantiated by the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend. Though the daily chart shows that attempts to break ₹263 for the past three trading sessions have failed, the 21-day moving average has crossed over the 50-day moving average, indicating a shift in the medium-term trend. Also, bullishness is exhibited by the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator. So, on the back of it, if the stock closes above ₹263 on daily basis, it will confirm a higher peak and will attract fresh buying interest, lifting the stock price further. On the upside, it will face resistances at ₹269 and ₹274. On the contrary, if the stock faces selling pressure, it will find immediate support at ₹258. But a break below that level could drag the stock to ₹250 over the medium term. Despite high volatility, the stock closed flat in October.
 










The Infosys stock was impacted by negative news and the price tumbled by a record level and even registered an 11-month low of ₹615.1. The 21-DMA has crossed below the 50-DMA; the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are pointing downwards making the medium-term outlook weak. However, the stock price recovered over the past week and managed to close at ₹687.9, above the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of ₹638. But only a break above ₹700 can lead to a sustainable recovery. Over the medium term, it is highly probable that the stock will consolidate within a broad range of between ₹620 and ₹700. In case the sentiment shifts in favour of the stock resulting in the breakout of ₹700, it will face hindrances at ₹745 and ₹760. Alternatively, if the price breaches the support at ₹620, it will test the 52-week low at ₹599.8. Below that level, the sell-off could accelerate, potentially pulling down the price to ₹575. The stock plunged 14.9 per cent in October.
 










Reliance Industries (RIL) continued its uptrend, hitting record high in the past week. The stock registered a new all-time high of ₹1,489.65 on Thursday and closed with significant gains for the third consecutive month. Though the bulls appear to be in control, there are some concerns which can be observed in the price action. The bearish divergence is visible in the weekly relative strength index (RSI), whereas the daily RSI is hovering in the over-bought territory after seven months. The moving average convergence divergence indicator also shows a bearish divergence in the weekly time-frame. These factors call for caution as the stock might witness a price correction. So, if the stock declines, ₹1,400 will act as a support. A break below that level could drag the stock to ₹1,360. But if the stock continues with the current bullish trend, it is highly likely that it will appreciate to ₹1,500. The stock gave a return of 10 per cent October.










 
A recovery in the stock price of Tata Steel accelerated last week as it cracked above a key resistance at ₹380 and closed at ₹399.8, testing the psychological level of ₹400. But the price has already confirmed a higher peak and the 21-day moving average is attempting to cross over the 50-day moving average – a bullish signal. The stock has also moved past the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous swing at ₹395, paving the way for further appreciation. The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are signalling a substantial bullish momentum. Importantly, the price action has developed a double bottom chart pattern on the daily chart, which already stands confirmed. The stock will face a resistance at ₹418, beyond which it has the potential to move towards ₹440. However, if the price level of ₹400 manages to hinder the gains, it could decline to the supports at ₹380 and ₹360. The stock gained 5.5 per cent in October."

A panoramic view of Reliance Petroleum’s refinery complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat

“It is my business judgement to sell my shares (whenever I want).” This is what lawyers of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) told the Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in defence against allegations by SEBI in the matter involving market violation in derivative segment for trading in share of Reliance Petroleum (RPL).
SEBI had banned RIL, India’s largest private sector company in terms of market-cap, from trading in equity futures after it found in violations of Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices (PFUTP) regulations. SEBI has even imposed disgorgement of gains on RIL that effectively comes to around ₹2,000 crore for manipulative traders in RPL in 2007.
Harish Salve, Supreme Court lawyer, has been appearing for RIL in SAT. RIL argument, which is now going on for the past three days, have been more on numbers, technical issues and figures mentioned in SEBI’s show cause notice.
RIL made several bold comments in SAT on SEBI allegations. The next hearing is scheduled on February 3.
“Yes I did earn money, stock exchange is a place where people come to earn money. If by my ‘legitimate’ sales the market is going down, I am allowed to do that...market runs that way,” RIL argued in SAT. But RIL has also told SAT that making money in F&O was not the object of this process.
“Did I gained by lowering the price? No. I gained by lowering the weighted average price and not the last trading price (LTP). I have been told that I sold shares below LTP but there were others as well who sold their shares below my LTP...May be it was the market sentiment.,” RIL argued.
SEBI said that RPL share price came under pressure and fell due to RIL selling. RIL told SAT that the dip in the shares was due to external factors and it was only hedging the risk. RIL countered SEBI allegations by saying that the regulator alleged that first heavy selling (in RPL shares) was on November 6 when a total of 7 crore shares were sold. This was not heaviest sale, RIL said, as after November 6 too there were sales of much higher number of RPL shares.
RIL told the tribunal that SEBI’s allegation that I (RIL) could have lost money in futures and options (F&O) and that’s why I (RIL) sold my shares is not correct. Different calculations were shown by the RIL the counsel on how his earnings in F&O.
SEBI SCN had also alleged benami transactions but RIL has argued that the five brokers were their agents and had contracts with 12 companies, earned profits and had business relations. RIL’s case is that there was nothing benami.
“The theory that we hired 12 agents to earn money, this theory is ridiculous,” RIL said.
RIL said there were no transactions undertaken by them to induce the investors. “If there is please show? Because of my selling there was drop of 99 paise in the price (of RPL shares). There were others who slid one crore shares at lower price as well.”
Reference was made by RIL to recent PwC judgment passed by the SAT. “Pg 28, Pg 30 (of SAT’s PwC order) third line (meaning of fraudulent). It is going to be my case. Fraud is an interaction between A and B. If I am on live screen of the stock market, I am not making any false representation but a genuine offer. Whom I have induced by making a legitimate offer to sell?” RIL said.
RIL further argued, that it had placed sell orders (for RPL shares) below LTP but the same could not be sold.
“Figures are being relied upon for market manipulation. No direct evidence to show intent. Penalised me for ₹400 crore approx on the profit I have earned. However, I have five different figures which show different profits. Promoter discloser is post transaction and not pre-transaction. First show cause notice leaned heavily on last 8.40 mins, then the regulator rushed to advocate to strengthen their case. Then they stressed on the 12 agents which we had already mentioned. Twelve agents have taken position on behalf of myself (admitted fact),” RIL said.
SEBI had found that RIL and 12 of its promoter group entities violated provisions of Section 12A of the SEBI Act, 1992, and SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to the securities market) Regulations, 2003.
The markets regulator had on March 24, 2017, prohibited RIL and 12 of its promoter group entities from dealing in equity derivatives. Following this, RIL was directed to disgorge ₹447 crore plus interest, the total of which comes to ₹1,952 crore.
In the case, which dates back to March 2007, RIL sold a five per cent stake in Reliance Petroleum, which was merged with RIL later, in 2009. SEBI observed that RIL via a few alleged front entities, executed trades in the cash market below the last traded price and triggered a sharp fall in the price of shares of Reliance Petroleum.
This fall in the share price allowed RIL and the entities linked to it to profit from their own short positions in the derivatives. RIL allegedly made illegal gains of ₹60.28 per share on 7.42 crore shares, SEBI had observed."
30,2019-11-17,Reliance,"Essar Steel, Adani, GAIL, HPCL buy bulk of Reliance gas 
 Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL have bought majority of natural gas from Reliance Industries’ newer fields in the KG-D6 block at an indicative price of $ 5.04 - 5.16 per unit, industry sources said.
 Essar Steel picked up 2.25 million standard cubic meters per day or about half of the available volumes in the day long auction conducted on November 15. Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) picked up 1.2 mmscmd while Adani Group, Mahanagar Gas Ltd and GAIL bought 0.3 mmscmd each, sources said.
 Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) bought 0.35 mmscmd and the remaining 0.10 mmscmd went to GSFC/GNFC. Reliance and its partner BP Plc of the UK had sought bids from potential users for the 5 mmscmd of natural gas they plan to produce from the R-Cluster Field in KG-D6 block from mid-2020.
 Bidders were asked to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required. Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.
 Sources said Reliance had set a floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price -- which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.
 In the November 15 auction, bidders quoted between 8.4 and 8.6 per cent slope to corner all of the 5 mmscmd supplies available. This translates into a price of between $ 5.04 per million British termal unit and $ 5.16 per mmBtu rate at Brent oil price of $ 60 per barrel.
 Sources said while bankruptcy-hit Essar bought gas to feed its steel plants, other buyers including Adani Group picked up the volumes for their city gas operations of retailing CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households.
 The volumes are mostly planned for usage in western India particularly in Gujarat where the gas can be delivered through a single pipeline - East-West pipeline. The delivered price in Gujarat is likely to be around $ 6.50 per mmBtu, they said.
 Initially, Reliance had set a floor of 9 per cent of dated Brent price, which translated into a gas price of $ 5.4 per mmBtu at $ 60 oil price. But consumers saw this as a very high price considering that imported LNG in the spot market is available at around $ 4 per mmBtu rate currently.
 To pacify the consumers, Reliance lowered the floor/minimum quote to 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price. The company did not immediately respond to an email sent for comments. According to the bid document, the gas price will be subject to the ceiling price mandated by the government. The ceiling price for gas from difficult fields such as those in deep-sea currently is $ 8.43 per mmBtu. The government-mandated rate for other fields currently is $3.23 per mmBtu."
31,2019-11-17,Reliance,"Weekly Trading Guide
After seeing a flat opening last week, the SBI stock broke out of the range between ₹315 and ₹324. It made an intra-week low of ₹299.7, but bounced up from that level as ₹300 is a strong support. However, the upward movement was capped by a resistance at ₹324 and the stock closed the week at ₹321.9, moving back into the range. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend is at ₹324, making the level a significant one. But the bounce-back looks strong and will most likely lift the price above ₹324 in the coming days. The 21-day moving average continues to remain above the 50-day moving average, maintaining the near-term outlook on the upside. The daily relative strength index, after a blip, is showing an uptick, but the moving average convergence divergence indicator has started to show weakness. If the stock continues to move up, breaking out of ₹324, it can possibly rise to ₹335 in the coming days. However, if the resistance holds and the stock declines, it can be expected to decline to ₹300.










The stock of ITC fell throughout last week and closed with a loss, consecutive in the last five trading sessions. Since the major trend is on the downside, the bears seem to have quickly gained traction on the reversal, negating the breakout of ₹263 in the previous week. At ₹250 level, the stock is hovering around the 50-day moving average. This level coincides with the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bull trend and can thus act as a good support. But the daily relative strength index has dipped below the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has slipped into the negative territory. Both conditions are considered as indicators of bearishness, and the stock will most likely fall in the coming days. On the downside, the stock might find support between ₹247 and ₹250. A break below that level can pull down the price to ₹242 levels. Alternatively, if the stock appreciates from the current level, it will face hurdles at ₹258 and ₹263. The stock declined by 3.8 per cent last week.










The recovery in Infosys stock looks to have taken a pause as it appears to have entered a consolidation phase. The price has been oscillating between ₹690 and ₹725 for the past two weeks. Until the stock continues to trade above ₹690, it is highly likely that it will resume the uptrend in coming days. However, a prolonged sideways movement can be risky, leading to a decline. The daily relative strength index, like the price action, seems to have become flat, whereas the moving average convergence divergence indicator is still in the positive region, indicating strength. In a scenario where the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range at ₹725, it will most likely appreciate to ₹760. This is a critical level as the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bear trend coincides with the 50-day moving average. Beyond that level, the stock has the potential to advance to ₹800 over the medium term. However, if it starts to move southwards and breaches the lower boundary of the range at ₹690, it could depreciate to ₹665, below which the support is at ₹620.










The stock of Reliance Industries gained in the latter part of last week after gradually declining during the week prior. This hints that the bullish trend might have resumed after the minor correction. On pullback, the price marked an intra-week low of ₹1,422.5, coinciding with the 21-day moving average. It then bounced from that level and ended the week at ₹1,470.8, retaining the bullish outlook. But looking at the oscillators, we can observe some weakness in the stock. The daily relative strength index is showing a down-tick following a bearish divergence; also, the moving average convergence divergence indicator has moved into the negative territory. Both indicators hint a potential trend-reversal. On the back of these factors, if the stock declines from the current level, it will find support at ₹1,430. A close below that level would result in a fresh low, taking the price to ₹1,400. However, if the stock gains bullish momentum and continues to advance, it will retest the lifetime high at ₹1,489.65. Resistance above that level is at ₹1,528.










The stock of Tata Steel was sluggish last week, and is hovering around the support at ₹395. Since it has extended the consolidation from the previous week, the recovery in the stock seems to be losing steam. The support at ₹380, coincided by the 21-day moving average, holds the key for the medium-term trend. So, as long as it trades above that level, the stock will have a bullish bias. But a break below that level could shift the trend to bearish. Since the overall trend is on the downside, this might result in a sharp depreciation. The daily relative strength index along with the moving average convergence divergence is showing a downward bias as it entered the negative territory. So, if the price weakens from the current level, the stock might slip towards the support at ₹380 in the near term, below which the support is at ₹360. On the other hand, if the stock starts moving on the upside, it will immediately face a resistance at ₹400. Above that level, the hurdle lies at ₹418 — the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend."

28,2019-11-20,Reliance,"RIL breaks into the club of six oil elites
 
Reliance Industries Ltd., run by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, has eclipsed BP Plc to break into an elite club of energy supermajors.
The Indian conglomerates market capitalization was about $133 billion, overtaking the British energy giants $132 billion value at the close of trading on Tuesday. Reliance’s shares have increased at three times the pace of India’s benchmark index this year after its billionaire owner in August announced plans to cut the company’s net debt to zero in 18 months through measures including a stake sale in the oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco.
The surge in shares gives Ambani a net worth of $56 billion, making him Asia’s richest person, above Alibaba Groups Jack Ma, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Reliance’s market value briefly surpassed BP for the first time at the end of last month, and it has now regained the lead over the British company after its shares ended at a record high in Mumbai. It also narrows the gap with PetroChina Co., currently Asia’s biggest oil company by market cap.
Reliance has increased 35% this year, compared with BP’s 1.2% gain as it works on cutting high debt levels. Oil companies have struggled because of swings in crude prices and as uncertainty persists over future energy demand.
Reliance, meanwhile, has benefited in a number of ways. It operates the worlds biggest oil-refining complex in western India, which can process low-quality crude and turn it into higher-grade fuels, partly protecting it from volatility in prices.
While Reliance gets two-third of its revenue from energy, Ambani has also made massive investments in telecom and digital services as he looks to benefit from growing demand in the worlds second-biggest market for mobile phone users. He has also expanded the company’s retail business to take on Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.
The telecom unit, Reliance Jio, which claims to be worlds largest mobile data network, was also bolstered by a recent blow to India’s wireless carriers that left Ambani’s company largely unscathed.
Reliance is now the worlds sixth-largest oil company, with Exxon Mobil Corp. topping the list with a market value of about $290 billion. Aramco, formally known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., is planning an initial public offering with a valuation target of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion, which would make it the worlds biggest."
27,2019-11-20,Reliance,"RIL m-cap inches closer to ₹10 lakh cr mark 
 The market valuation of Reliance Industries, the country’s most valued firm, is fast nearing the ₹10 lakh crore mark helped by continuous rise in its share price. The company’s stock on Wednesday climbed 4.10 per cent to ₹1,571.85 -- its record high -- on the BSE.
Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio on Tuesday said it will increase mobile phone call and data charges in the next few weeks in compliance with rules, as it followed similar announcements by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on tariff hike.

Led by gains in its stock price, the company’s market valuation rose to ₹9,90,366.80 crore during the morning trade.
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) on Tuesday achieved another milestone, becoming the first Indian firm to hit a market valuation of ₹9.5 lakh crore. Last month, RIL became the first Indian firm to hit the Rs 9 lakh crore market valuation mark in intra-day trade."
26,2019-11-21,Reliance,"Will RIL hit ₹10-lakh-cr in market cap today?


All eyes are on Reliance Industries as it nears the ₹10-lakh-crore mark. At the close of Wednesday’s trading, the company’s market capitalisation stood at ₹9.8 lakh crore. RIL’s stock rose 2.47 per cent to close at ₹1,547.05 on the BSE. During the day, it jumped 4.1 per cent to ₹1,571.85 — its record high. If the stock hits ₹1,579, the market-cap will hit ₹10 lakh crore. Though some analysts advice caution on the stock, market participants believe Reliance Industries will reach the coveted level."

24,2019-11-28,Reliance,"RIL becomes first Indian firm to hit Rs 10 lakh crore m-cap mark 
 Reliance Industries (RIL), on Thursday, became the first Indian company to hit the Rs 10 lakh crore market valuation level in intra-day following a spike in its share price.
The oil-to-telecom conglomerate’s market capitalisation (m-cap) zoomed to Rs 10.02 lakh crore during morning trade on the BSE. The company’s stock rose 0.73 per cent to a record peak of Rs 1,581.25 in intra-day trade on the stock exchange.
Later, it retreated from the milestone and the firm’s m-cap was around Rs 9,99,368.41 crore at 1050 hours.
Over the past few session, RIL’s market valuation has been hovering near the Rs 10 lakh crore mark. In October this year, its shares hit the Rs 9 lakh crore m-cap level. In August 2018, it became the first Indian company to have crossed the Rs 8 lakh crore m-cap mark.
So far this year, the company’s scrip has zoomed 41 per cent, much higher than the 13.8 per cent rise in Sensex so far in 2019.
TCS is the country’s second most valued firm with a market valuation of Rs 7,79,708.02 crore, followed by HDFC Bank with a market cap of Rs 6,96,494.75 crore, Hindustan Unilever (Rs 4,49,252.62 crore) and HDFC (Rs 3,99,599.38 crore).

Reliance Industries’ standalone profit rose 2.4% to Rs. 9,036 crore




Reliance Industries’ standalone profit rose 2.4% to Rs. 9,036 crore


 Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries on Thursday denied reports of selling its news media business to Times Group.
Bloomberg early on Thursday reported that Ambani “is in talks to sell his news media assets to India’s Times Group, as Asia’s richest man plans to unload a business that’s been losing money.”
Read the Bloomberg report on Reliance Industries in talks with Times Group to sell its news assets
“Reliance Industries firmly denies (the) story. The story is baseless and false,” a company spokesperson said. The report had quoted people familiar with the matter to say that Bennett Coleman & Co, the publisher of the Times of India, is looking to hire advisers for due diligence on the news properties of Ambani’s Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.
Bennett Coleman’s spokesperson couldn’t be immediately reached for comments.
Reliance had in 2014 bought Network18, which owns and operates 56 local channels spanning news and entertainment, for up to ₹4,000 crore. Network18 owns TV channels (including CNBCTV18, CNN-IBN, CNN Awaz), websites (firstpost.com, moneycontrol.com), magazines (including the license for Forbes India), entertainment channel (Colors and MTV) among other businesses.
Unlisted Bennett Coleman, also known as the Times Group, already has two news channels -- Times Now (for general news) and ET Now (the business news channel) which compete with Network18’s general news channel News18 and business news channel CNBCTV18.
TV18 Broadcast Ltd - the BSE-listed firm that houses the news channels - has a market cap of about ₹4,100 crore. Promoters hold 60.40 per cent interest in the company which had in the July-September quarter reported a net loss of ₹1.03 crore. It had a profit of ₹8.5 crore in 2018-19 fiscal.
Last month, Reliance in its consolidated earnings statement for the July-September quarter reported a ₹47 crore pre-tax profit from its media business on a revenue of ₹1,174 crore. “Robust 43 per cent growth in subscription income post-implementation of new tariff order (NTO) was offset by a weak advertising environment,” it had said. “News portfolio solidified its leadership with a 10.9 per cent viewership share. Broad-based cost optimizations led to Entertainment Business-as-usual (BAU) margins rising to 12.9 per cent, vs 9.9 per cent in 2Q FY19.”"
22,2019-11-28,Reliance,"Reliance hits market cap of Rs 10 lakh crore, a first for an Indian firm 
 
Riding on a stock market rally that defies the gloom generated by prime economic indicators, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) created history on Thursday when it became the first Indian company to scale the market capitalization of Rs 10 lakh crore.
RIL shares have risen nearly 40% so far this year.
The benchmark rose 109 points higher on Thursday to settle at 41,130.
The stock market euphoria over the last few days helped RIL reach a new 52-week high of Rs 1,584 a share on Thursday before closing at Rs 1,579.95 a share. At this share price, RIL is valued at Rs 10,01,555.42 crore, making it India’s most valued company.
Ambani, who owns some 42% stake in RIL, is now ranked 12th richest in the world and Asia’s richest with a personal wealth of $60.7 billion.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in an October research note that RIL could become the first Indian company to reach $200 billion in market capitalization in 24 months driven mainly by its new commerce initiatives, SME enterprise play, fibre broadband and digital initiatives.
Market sources said that the interest in RIL shares has been stoked by a series of announcements made by Ambani since August to make it a net debt-free company by FY21, including selling a 20% stake in its oil to chemicals business to Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, for Rs 1.03 lakh crore.
In October, RIL also said it was setting up a wholly-owned subsidiary for its digital initiatives including RJio."

Reliance Industries Ltd has announced that its newly created subsidiary for digital services will be called Jio Platforms Limited. 
In October, RIL said it has set up a wholly-owned subsidiary for its digital initiatives, with a total capital infusion of ₹1.73-lakh crore.
Under this arrangement, ₹1,08,000 crore of RJio’s liabilities will be transferred to RIL. The new company will house all of RIL’s digital entities including RJio and other technology-based initiatives in education, healthcare and agriculture services.
Read | RIL to create ₹1.08-lakh-cr digital giant
Reliance Industries' move to put all its digital initiatives under a new wholly-owned subsidiary is aimed at monetising Reliance Jio through an initial open offer. The telecom business needs further capital as the ecosystem moves to 5G and RIL is ensuring that it has enough power to raise funds whenever required.
RIL has already demerged the telecom infrastructure including tower and fibre into a separate company, which has been monetised through a deal with private equity firm -- Brookfield. Post this demerger, RJIL has become asset light having a balance sheet size of ₹2,37,000 crore.
 Now, by putting all the digital entities under a new company, RIL is readying the services arm for a possible monetisation.

 Telecom operator Reliance Jio has claimed that it is offering five times more free outgoing calls limit on other networks than an average customer requires and they are unlikely to pay for the calls.
The Mukesh Ambani-led telecom operator added that its new plan are offering up to 25 per cent more value than that of rivals.
Reaction from Reliance Jio came after Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea removed cap on outgoing calls limit outside their network with effect from December 6, the day Reliance Jio rolled out mobile call and data plans priced up to 40 per cent compared to previous offerings.
“Entitlement for off-net calls in Jio’s ‘All in One Plans’ is more than 5 times of what an average customer uses as per industry data and consequently, an average Jio customer is unlikely to have to ever pay for off net calls. We reiterate that Jio plans offer up to 25 per cent higher value than comparable plans of other operators,” Reliance Jio said in a statement.
The company is offering 1,000 minutes per month (28-day cycle) of free calling every month across all plans.
Both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea earlier capped outgoing calls to other networks at 1,000 minutes in plan with 28-days validity, 3,000 minutes in 84-day validity and 12,000 in 365 days validity plan. Beyond this limit, customers were required to pay 6 paise per minute for outgoing calls made to other networks."
17,2019-12-10,Reliance,"Hurun’s list: Mukesh Ambani may soon break into top 5
Riding the digital wave, Mukesh Ambani, the first Indian to break into the global top 10 rich list, would emerge as one of the five richest people in the world in the next two or three years. 
The Chairman of Reliance Industries would be the only Indian to feature in Hurun’s Global Rich List in this time frame.
However, a surprise contender for the top position would be French multi-national luxury goods conglomerate Louis Vuitton SE group head, Bernard Arnault, who is in a neck-to-neck race with Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos.
“The next millions for Ambani would come in from telecom and retail and all the things he is building around it. So, it would come from broadband, the Internet and the entire eco-system, and his plans to integrate kirana stores with the telecom infrastructure, among others,” Rupert Hoogewerf, founder and Chairman of Hurun Report, which compiles the rich list of many countries, told BusinessLine.
In 2019, Jeff Bezos topped the Hurun Global Rich List for a second year in a row, and Ambani — who holds about 52 per cent stake in RIL — ranked 10th. To move into the top slot, Mukesh Ambani’s net worth should nearly double to $100 billion from the present $54 billion (₹3.83-lakh crore), as that of others in the race is also set to rise.
21st Century Baifu Academy, a business institute promoted by Hurun Report, brings a group of global entrepreneurs to engage with their Indian counterparts. This year also it brought about 30 entrepreneurs to India.
At the last count, Hurun Report found 494 Unicorns globally and India was ranked third with 21. The Indian list was led by payments solutions platform One97 Communications ($10 billion), followed by cab aggregator Ola Cabs ($6 billion) and online educator Byju’s ($6 billion), and travel-stay finder OYO Rooms ($5 billion) ranked third.
India has 20 or 30 Mountain Goats (a start-up with a potential to emerge as a Unicorns in next two to three years) and 10-20 Cheetahs (which will take three to four to become a Mountain Goat).
“While Mountain Goats can’t make many mistakes, Cheetahs have to run fast to become Mountain Goats. We have come up with formal definitions to help investors understand the start-up space,” Hoogewerf added."
16,2019-12-11,Reliance,"Investors eye companies planning to list subsidiaries


Some of the companies that are unlocking investor value by listing their subsidiaries separately are in great demand, particularly after State Bank of India reserved a portion of the SBI Card and Payment Services initial public offer for retail investors. SBI also plans to list SBI Securities.
Though dates for the initial public offer have not been finalised, SBI Cards plans to raise Rs 500 crore through issue of fresh equity and another 130,526,798 equity shares will be on offer for sale by the promoters. SBI has reserved 13,052,680 shares for its existing shareholders. Each shareholder can invest up to Rs 2 lakh under the shareholders’ quota.
Following the development, SBI shares spurted to Rs 310 on Wednesday, from their 52-week low of Rs 244 on October 9.
Similarly, HDFC and HDFC Bank plan to list their holding in HDFC Securities and HDB Finance, while ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank will list their subsidiaries, ICICI Pru Mutual Fund and Kotak Securities, respectively.
Among corporates, Reliance Industries has announced plans to spin off its holding in telecom giant Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail into separate entities.
In a move that is perceived as preparation for RJio’s listing and reduction of debt, RIL has transferred some of the assets and liabilities of RJio into two investment infrastructure trusts (InvITs) and brought in Brookfield Asset Management as an investor. The Brookfield firm had agreed to subscribe to Rs 25,215 crore worth units in the Tower Infrastructure Trust.
Jio's Ebitda stood at Rs 15,102 crore last fiscal, against Rs 6,734 crore in FY'18, though the sharp jump in EBITDA is not enough for RIL to recover investments of Rs 3.5 lakh crore in the next 10 years.
Atish Matlawala, Senior Analyst, SSJ Finance & Securities, said there are a number of companies which will list their subsidiaries in the next few months.
All these companies will reserve some portion of their IPO for shareholders of the parent company, thus improving the shareholders’ chances of getting allotment, he said.
If the IPO size is between Rs 1,000-1,500 crore, he said, it made sense to become a shareholder of the parent company before it files a RHP (Red Herring Prospectus) for the IPO. Usually, the date of filing the RHP is considered the cut-off date to be eligible for subscribing to shareholders’ portion of the IPO, he said.
In case of large IPOs of over Rs 8,000 crore, usually, all retail applicants will get at least one lot. However, if somebody wants to invest the full quota of Rs 2 lakh for the retail investor, it is advisable to become a shareholder before the cut-off date, he said."

12,2019-12-15,Reliance,"Weekly trading guide: ITC rebounds from a crucial support 
The uptrend in the SBI stock since the beginning of October witnessed a correction after it registered a four-month high of ₹351 in late November. The correction resulted in the price dropping to ₹308, where the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the prior bull trend lies. The stock took that level as a support and bounced sharply the past week. Also, the daily relative strength index is showing an uptick, and it has crossed above the midpoint level of 50. Thus, the bull trend seems to have resumed and the outlook is positive for the script. However, one needs to be watchful of the resistance in the band between ₹332 and ₹335. From a trading perspective, rather than creating fresh long positions at the current level, one can buy the stock after it closes above ₹335 on a daily basis or if it moderates to ₹325. The initial stop-loss can be placed at ₹315; start shifting it upward with a gap of 1.5 times the ATR (average true range) as the stock advances. The key resistances on the upside are at ₹350 and ₹362.










The stock of ITC has been on a decline since the beginning of November. The decline was stopped at the support of ₹235. This level has been acting as a strong support since August. The stock recovered and ended the week at ₹241.6, forming a reversal candlestick pattern, ie, a hammer in the weekly chart. However, the stock at the current level is facing a stiff resistance at ₹243. This level also coincides with the 23.6 Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend, making the resistance more significant. Hence, for the stock to perform a sustainable rally, the price should close above ₹243 on a daily basis. So, from the perspective of trading, one can approach the stock in two ways. One, initiate fresh long positions if the stock closes above ₹243 and place the stop-loss at ₹238. Two, buy the stock if it falls to ₹235 as that level is a strong support and the risk-reward ratio is highly favourable for long positions; place the stop-loss at ₹230. The potential short-term targets on the upside are at ₹247.5 and ₹252.










 The stock of Infosys continues to trade along the sideways trend. Since the beginning of November, the stock has been held between two key levels at ₹690 and ₹725. As the consolidation phase has been in place for quite some time, the oscillators, ie, the moving average convergence divergence and the relative strength index in the daily chart, are unable to hint any direction. Moreover, the 21- and the 50-day moving averages have converged to the same price level due to lack of trend. Hence, the next leg of the trend can be confirmed only if the stock gets out of this range; traders are advised to stay on the fence until then. If the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range at ₹725, the rally will lead the price towards ₹760. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bear trend coincides with this level, making it a considerable resistance. Any further appreciation will take the stock to ₹800. On the other hand, if the stock breaks below the lower boundary of the range, it could decline to ₹665. Below that level, the support is at ₹620.










 The recent uptrend in the stock of RIL, that began in August, seems to have taken a pause. The price has been consolidating for the past three weeks. However, there are certain indications that the stock might witness a downward movement. The daily relative strength index has formed a bearish divergence, a negative indication; the moving average convergence divergence indicator also exhibits a negative bias. But by observing the price action, we can find that the stock has formed a strong base at ₹1,534, and as long as the price stays above this level, the script can be approached with a bullish inclination. Also, the stock remains above the 21-day moving average, maintaining the short- term positive outlook. Hence, from a trading perspective, one can buy the stock when it retests ₹1,534, and place the stop-loss at ₹1,525. The near-term target can be at ₹1,610. If the stock breaks out the 52-week high at ₹1,614.45, it might appreciate to ₹1,665. Strictly adhere to the stop-loss as a break below ₹1,534 could reverse the trend to bearish.










 The recent bull trend in the stock faced a hurdle, and it pulled back twice in the past one month. But the stock managed to restrict the declines, forming higher lows at ₹383.1 and ₹389. Last week, the stock went up and closed at ₹428.4. It also closed above the 21-day moving average, corroborating the bullish bias. The daily relative strength index is showing an uptick and so is the moving average convergence divergence indicator. All these factors indicate a positive momentum being built up in the stock. However, it faces a resistance at ₹434, where the previous rally was capped. Hence, this is an important level, and a close above it will be necessary to carry over the momentum. Given the scenario, traders are recommended not to initiate fresh short positions as the stock is in a bullish momentum. Wait for the stock to decisively breach ₹434, and initiate long positions with a stop-loss at ₹405 with the potential target at ₹460. As the stock advances, move the stop-loss with a span of 1.5 times the ATR (average true range)."

 BP and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has signed a definitive agreement relating to the formation of their new Indian fuels and mobility joint venture branded as Jio-BP.
The partners intend to set up a new joint venture company, held 51 per cent by RIL and 49 per cent by BP, that will assume ownership of RIL’s existing Indian fuel retail network and access its aviation fuel business.
Reliance will receive ₹7,000 crore from BP for acquiring a 49 per cent stake in the petro-retail JV.
The venture expects to expand from RIL’s current fuel retailing network of over 1,400 retail sites and 30 aviation fuel stations across India to up to 5,500 retail sites and 45 aviation fuel stations over the next five years to become the most preferred provider of automotive and aviation fuels.
The retail network will operate under the Jio-BP brand, signalling a new paradigm shift in fuels marketing and mobility solutions. It brings together Reliance’s extensive access and connection to consumers through its Jio digital platform and BP’s deep experience in fuel retailing around the world. The joint venture will seek to offer Indian consumers high-quality differentiated fuels, convenience and services.
Castrol lubricants will also be available across the venture’s network.
The venture is expected to be formed during the first half of 2020, subject to regulatory and other customary approvals.

9,2019-12-20,Reliance,"Shell-Reliance give up Panna-Mukta fields; western offshore fields to revert to ONGC 
 After operating Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields for 25 years, Royal Dutch Shell and Reliance Industries will revert the western offshore fields back to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), the companies said in a statement.
 Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea off the Mumbai coast were in 1994 awarded a consortium of US energy giant Enron and Reliance. ONGC, which had originally discovered the fields, as a government nominee given 40 per cent back-in rights.
 Enron during its bankruptcy was taken over by BG Group of UK in 2003. BG Group’s interest was subsequently taken over by Shell in 2016.
 The 25-year production sharing contracts for the PMT fields expires this week and Reliance and Shell had decided not to seek an extension for Panna-Mukta fields.
“After 25 years of operating the Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, the Panna-Mukta and Tapti Joint Venture partners will be handing over the Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields back to the Government of India’s (GOI) nominee i.e. ONGC on December 21, 2019,” a joint statement issued by Reliance and Shell said.
 Reliance and BG Exploration and Production India Ltd (BGEPIL) hold 30 per cent stake each in PMT while the balance 40 per cent is with ONGC.
“The production sharing contracts (PSC) for the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields, which were executed by the PMT JV with the Government of India in 1994, will expire on December 21, 2019,” it said.
 The Tapti fields had ceased production earlier in 2016 and the Tapti process platform facilities were handed over to ONGC (GOI nominee) in 2016.
 Decommissioning and site restoration of residual Tapti facilities, including five unmanned platforms and in-field pipelines, are currently being carried out by the PMT JV under India’s first offshore decommissioning and site restoration project.
 The Tapti decommissioning and other commercial activities would continue in BGEPIL even after Panna-Mukta handover, as per the statement.
 The Panna-Mukta fields, off the Mumbai coast, produced 211 million barrels of oil and 1.25 Trillion cubic feet of natural gas since December 1994. In 2019, the average monthly production from the fields was around 10,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 140 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day.
 Speaking on the development, Trivikram Arun, Managing Director, BGEPIL said, “The PMT JV is a great example of a successful partnership between India’s largest national oil company (ONGC), India’s largest private company (Reliance) and an international oil company (Shell).” 
 “Our teams have worked relentlessly to ensure a safe handover of the producing fields from the PMT JV to ONGC at the end of the term,” he said.
 B Ganguly, President-E&P, Reliance said, “At their peak, Panna-Mukta have contributed to nearly 6 per cent of India’s oil production and almost 7 per cent of India’s gas production in the year 2007-08. Reliance has been a part of this journey and contributed, by providing energy, to the growth and development of India’s oil and gas sector.”"
8,2019-12-21,Reliance,"Centre seeks court backing to stall Reliance plan to sell stake to Saudi Aramco
 
Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner, British Gas, handed back the Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields to the government on Saturday at the end of the 25-year production sharing contracts (PSC), while a court in Delhi asked the duo on Friday to disclose their assets on an application brought by the Central Government seeking to recover $4.5 billion (about Rs30,000 crore) in dues on the deal.
The Central Government’s application, which was heard by the Delhi High Court on Friday, seeks to restrain Reliance and BG from disposing off their assets, including Mukesh Ambani’s plan, announced on August 12, to sell a 20 per cent stake in the oil to chemicals business of Reliance Industries to Saudi Aramco for as much as Rs 1.03 lakh crore or roughly $15 billion, a media report said on Saturday.
Reliance and British Gas each held a 30 per cent participatory interest in the joint venture company formed to operate the Panna-Mukta-Tapti oil and gas fields on a 25-year contract.
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) held a 40 per cent participatory interest in the joint venture.
Reliance and BG said in a statement on Friday that they will hand over the Panna and Mukta oil and gas fields to ONGC, the government’s nominee, on Saturday.
In 2016, the two companies had handed over the Tapti process platform facilities to ONGC after the field ceased production.
The government, in its application, alleged that the two companies failed to honour a $4.5-billion international arbitral award in the production sharing contracts for the oil and gas fields, forcing it to file the application for executing of the award. 
The Centre, which has been fighting the arbitration since 2010, alleged that Reliance and British Gas appropriated huge sums of money in violation of the production sharing contracts.
On the basis of the tribunal award, the government drew up a claim for $3.8 billion, excluding interest, which is now estimated at $4.5 billion, including interest, according to the report.
A spokesman for Reliance did not respond to a phone call and text message seeking comment. British Gas could not be reached immediately for comment.
The PMT fields were the first fields in India to be operated under a Joint Operatorship model. The Panna-Mukta fields, off the Mumbai coast, have produced 211 MMBBLs of oil and 1.25 TCF of natural gas since December 1994. In 2019, the average monthly production from the fields was ~10,000 bbls/day of crude oil and 140 mmscf/day of natural gas.
At their peak, Panna-Mukta have contributed nearly 6 per cent of the country’s oil production and almost 7 per cent of its gas production in 2007-08."

 Reliance Industries has mounted a strong counter to the government petition in the Delhi High Court seeking to block its USD 15 billion deal with Saudi Aramco, saying the petition is an abuse of process as no arbitration award has fixed any final liability of dues on the company.
In a counter affidavit, Reliance said it was a “falsehood” to say that the arbitration tribunal had passed an award requiring the company and its partners to pay USD 3.5 billion to the government. ? 
 It said the petition is an abuse of process as “it portrays that a sum of money is due and payable under the final award and purports to compute the money payable on a basis neither found in the arbitration award nor disclosed in the petition.” 
The government, it said, has calculated on its own volition the revised figure of its share of profit from oil and gas production allegedly due by extrapolating the purported finds."
6,2019-12-22,Reliance,"Weekly Trading Guide: Infosys breaks out of the range
The resumption of the bull trend looks evident as SBI closed the week above the resistance band between ₹332 and ₹335. The stock began the week on the back foot, slipping to the support level of ₹325. This support also coincides with the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bull trend. The stock took support at this level and began to rally. The bullish stance is corroborated by key oscillators. The relative strength index in the daily chart shows a fresh uptick following the rally in price. 
 










 
Also, the moving average convergence divergence indicator is on the verge of entering the positive territory. Thus, traders can continue to take a bullish view and initiate long positions on corrections. The initial stop-loss can be placed at ₹320 and subsequently revised upwards by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock moves upward. The immediate resistance is currently at ₹351 currently — its previous high. The subsequent resistance is at ₹362.
The prevailing bear trend, which has been in place since the beginning of November, appears to be limiting the upside in the stock. The stock of ITC gave up its entire intra-week gains. In the past week, after breaking out of the resistance at ₹243, the stock faced resistance at ₹247.5, and started to decline from that level. This level coincides with the 38.2 Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend, making it a significant resistance. 
 










 
However, fresh short positions are not recommended at the current levels even though the stock is trading with a bearish bias, as the risk-reward ratio is not favourable. Importantly, the moving average convergence divergence indicator in the daily chart shows signs of recovery as it has moved into the positive region. Moreover, the price level of ₹235 is a strong support. Hence, unless the stock breaks either ₹235 or ₹247.5, the trend will be unclear. Until then, traders can adopt a range- trading strategy. The resistance above ₹247.5 is at ₹252; the support below ₹235 is at ₹228.
After consolidating since the beginning of November, the stock of Infosys moved out of the range between ₹690 and ₹725. It rallied past the upper boundary of the range at ₹725 and closed the week at 731.5, confirming the breakout. Thus, the medium- term outlook for the stock has become bullish. Adding to the positive bias, the daily relative strength index has formed a new high, following the breakout. Also, the moving average convergence divergence in the daily chart is exhibiting bullish bias. 
 








 
 
The 21- and 50-DMAs are currently at the same level, ie, ₹710, and the stock is trading well above that level — another positive indication. From the perspective of trading, one can initiate fresh long positions on dips with a dynamic stop-loss. While the initial stop- loss can be placed at ₹700, move it upwards by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock advances. The primary target can be at the resistance level of ₹760 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. On further appreciation, the stock can rise to ₹800.
The stock of Reliance Industries (RIL), which has been in an uptrend since August, has been consolidating within a range for the past month. But recently, it bounced from the 21-day moving average and registered a fresh lifetime high of ₹1,617.55. Thus, the bull trend seems to be gaining traction after the pause. But it should be noted that, despite making new highs, the relative strength index (RSI) and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are showing a lack of momentum. In fact, we can spot a bearish divergence in the RSI, hinting at the possibility of a trend- reversal. 
 








 
 
However, the stock has a solid base at ₹1,534, and unless the price breaks below it, the trend-reversal cannot be confirmed. Also, the 21-day moving average is acting as a reasonable support. So, traders can be cautiously bullish and buy the stock on declines. Place a trailing stop-loss at ₹1,550 and raise it by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock appreciates. The short-term targets are at ₹1,665 and ₹1,700.
Extending the bull run, the stock of Tata Steel surged last week. It breached a crucial resistance at ₹434. Thus, it has formed a new peak in the daily chart, denoting a good upward momentum. Substantiating the bullish bias, the moving average convergence divergence indicator in the daily chart continues to advance, implying considerable strength in the uptrend. 
 
 








 
 
However, while the bull trend is backed by several factors, it may not be favourable to buy the stock at the current levels as ₹460 is a crucial resistance. Also, the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level is at ₹470. So, the price band between ₹460 and ₹470 might act as a resistance band, where the stock can witness some profit- booking. From a trading perspective, it can be approached in two ways. Either initiate fresh long positions on a close above ₹470 with the stop-loss at ₹445 or buy the stock if the price moderates to ₹440 with the stop- loss at ₹425. The potential targets on the upside are at ₹495 and ₹515."
5,2019-12-24,Reliance,"Govt-RIL face-off
With its latest salvo on Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd, does the government want to send the signal “my way or highway” to the corporate world ? Or is the government merely protecting its revenues?
The events of the last couple of days have revived memories of the time when there was an open war between the government and RIL. But this time there’s a difference. The government has moved a petition in the Delhi High Court seeking to restrain RIL and BG from disposing of their assets. And this also includes RIL’s plan to sell 20 per cent to Saudi Aramco.
This was sought before the High Court during the argument on an application filed in September, where the government had sought curbs, citing the failure of the two companies to honour their payment under a $4.5-billion international arbitral award in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) production-sharing contracts. 
Not to take it lying down, RIL has come with a strong counter to the government’s petition in the High Court seeking to block its $15-billion deal with Saudi Aramco. RIL said that the Centre’s petition is an abuse of process as till date the quantum of award in the PMT deal has not been decided and this will be done only after issues are settled.
So why would the government do this when it should be promoting foreign direct investment? Is it politics or protecting government revenues? Has the situation not been dealt with tactfully?
Whatever be it, the move seems to have caught everyone by surprise and also sent out a wrong signal to the corporate world, particularly when India wants to project itself as a country which offers “ease of doing business”. 
In fact, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Saudi Arabia, it was acknowledged that energy security would be one of the prime areas of India’s engagement with Saudi Arabia, which plays a vital role as a reliable long term energy supplier. “…Saudi Aramco is participating in a major refinery and petrochemical project on India’s west coast. We are also looking forward to the participation of Aramco in India’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves,” the Prime Minister had said.
It appears the concerned departments and ministries of the government merely want to ensure that Saudi Aramco is aware of the PMT issue as the amount involved is not small. The government could be justified here. 
But, is the approach of linking two very distinct deals correct? One could argue that it involves the same entity, namely, RIL, and when Aramco comes as a partner, it may have its own approach to the deal. There are lots of knots to be untangled here. The PMT joint venture comprises ONGC, RIL and BG Exploration & Production India Ltd/Shell, with each holding 40 per cent, 30 per cent and 30 per cent participating interest respectively.
The Tapti fields had ceased production in 2016 and the platform facilities were handed over to ONGC (GOI nominee) in the same year. The PMT contract of 1994 came to an end on December 21, 2019. The government has filed an execution petition to enforce a partial award issued by an Arbitral Tribunal in October 2016. The award decided some of the issues between the parties. But a later partial award went against the government. The final phase of the arbitration is in March-April 2020. 
The contractors — Shell and RIL — maintain that no amount is payable as claimed by the government, and after the final award it will be known whether any sum is payable at all. 
But the government is concerned about its ability to recover the awards as the production-sharing contract has come to an end. The High Court has asked Shell and RIL to file a list of their assets in a format that has been outlined by the court, pursuant to which affidavits were filed. 
But the pertinent question remains: What is the government really worried about?"

 Its been a good year for Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani.
The Indian tycoon added almost $18 billion to his wealth, the most in Asia, taking his net worth to $61.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In comparison, Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma’s net worth grew $11 billion, while Jeff Bezos lost $13.6 billion.
The surge in Ambani’s fortune this year was fuelled by a 40 per cent jump in the shares of his Reliance Industries Ltd, a conglomerate that is pivoting more toward consumer offerings than its core oil refining and petrochemicals businesses. The rally in the stock is almost triple the gains for India’s benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index.
Investors are piling money on Reliance, betting newer businesses such as telecommunications and retail could soon unlock value. With a goal of building a local e-commerce giant to challenge the likes of Amazon.com Inc. in India, Ambani has spent almost $50 billion, mostly debt, on a wireless carrier that has become India’s No 1 within three years of début.
Mukesh Ambani changed the narrative for Reliance Industries as a leader not just in oil and gas, but also in telecom and retail, and possibly soon in e-commerce as well, said Chakri Lokapriya, chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management, which oversees $3 billion in assets in Mumbai. “He successfully identified, invested and executed rapidly to create this new narrative,” Lokapriya said. We believe this can potentially double shareholder value over the next four years.
The newer businesses are likely to contribute 50 per cent of Reliance’s earnings in a few years, from about 32 per cent now, Ambani said in August. A representative for Reliance did not reply to an email seeking comment on Ambani’s wealth.
While the success of the phone operator was a cause for cheer, the business moguls plans to pare Reliance’s debt has sent Reliance’s stock soaring to a record.
Ambani, 62, has vowed to slash the groups net debt to zero by early 2021. Plans include a stake sale in Reliance’s oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Arabian Oil Co, listings of the telecommunications and retail units within five years, sale of tower assets and strategic partners for a digital platform linked to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, the phone company.
The value of Reliance’s shares have almost tripled since the end of 2016, when Jio entered the Indian market with free calls and cheap data and forced some heavily indebted incumbents to exit or merge with rivals. With more than 350 million users, unlisted Jio reported a net income of 9.96 billion rupees ($134 million) for the September quarter while the other two private sector operators amassed record losses.
Still, investors have been wary of the ballooning debt at the group that spent about $76 billion in the last five years. Reliance Industries had a net debt of 1.54 trillion rupees ($21.6 billion) at the end of March 31, Ambani told shareholders in August.
Aiding Reliance’s efforts to cut debt would be:
The transaction with Aramco has run into a hurdle that threatens to jeopardise Ambani’s debt paring plans. A court has sought details of Reliance’s assets after the Indian government petitioned to stop the proposed sale in an unrelated arbitration lawsuit. Ambani, however, has a proven record in keeping his promises that investors are relying on.
Ambani created value in Jio, which he deleveraged by hiving off his infrastructure assets to Brookfield, said Sandeep Gupta, managing director, Protiviti India. He can further deleverage the company from a debt point of view by bringing in strategic investors, which will raise the value further."

A stock swap offer to help shareholders of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s unlisted retail business monetize their investment has valued the unit at $34 billion.
Share owners in Reliance Retail Ltd can exchange four shares for one of its listed parent Reliance Industries Ltd, according to a so-called scheme of arrangement posted on the groups website. With the parents latest market capitalization at Rs 9.8 lakh crore, the share swap values the subsidiary at Rs 2.4 lakh crore, according to Bloomberg’s calculation.
Asia's richest man is scouting for investors for the profitable retail unit. The share swap, which will help Reliance Retail employees monetize their illiquid stock options, values the company at more than Tesco Plc, the United Kingdom’s (UK) biggest supermarket chain. Ambani has promised to slash the groups net debt zero to zero by March 2021 after an investment spree of $76 billion in the past five years, bulk of it on its massively disruptive telecom carrier.
We will induct leading global partners in these businesses in the next few quarters, and move toward listing of both these companies within the next five years, Ambani had told shareholders in August referring to the retail and telecom units.
For the year to March, Reliance’s organised retail revenue jumped 89 per cent to Rs 1.3 lakh crore in the year. The earnings before interest and taxes jumped 169 per cent to Rs 55.5 lakh crore, according to a company statement which did not specify a net income for the business.
Reliance Retail, with 10,901 stores across the country, runs India’s largest chain of neighbourhood supermarket stores and consumer electronics stores besides being the top wholesale supplier to nations army of small shopkeepers.
The valuation set by Reliance is double that of Avenue Supermarts Ltd, which runs India’s biggest supermarket chain. Tesco is valued at $32 billion."
2,2019-12-29,Reliance,"Why the RIL stock rallied
 
After slipping earlier last week, the stock of Reliance Industries (RIL) gained about 2 per cent on Friday. A couple of factors seems to have helped the stock rebound. 
One, RIL’s plan to offer one share in the company for four shares in its unlisted subsidiary Reliance Retail values the retail business at about ₹2.5-lakh crore — double that of peer Avenue Supermarts that had a blockbuster IPO in 2017. 
The share swap offer, open to employee shareholders of Reliance Retail, seems to be laying the floor valuation for the eventual listing of Reliance Retail. While the valuation of Reliance Retail implied by the proposed share swap is lower than what some brokerages had estimated, the market appears pleased with the ball being set into motion for the value unlocking in the coming years. Next, the National Company Law Tribunal rejected a petition of the I-Tax Department against Reliance Jio hiving off its fibre and tower business. This removes a roadblock from RIL’s debt reduction plans."

Following this, Reliance's stake in KG-D6 has gone up to 66.67 per cent from the previous 60 per cent and that of BP to 33.33 per cent from 30 per cent.
Niko has been scouting for a buyer for its 10 per cent stake in KG-D6 or securing financing for its share of the $5 billion R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ development projects in the block after defaulting on lenders’ dues.
Since these attempts were unsuccessful, it defaulted on making payments for its share of development cost of the D6 block, thereby attracting a default notice from the other partners.
In December 2018, Reliance and BP sought Niko’s exit from the KG-D6, against which Niko filed for arbitration."
