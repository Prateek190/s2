58,2018-09-07,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma gets regulatory observations from USFDA 
Drugmaker Sun Pharma has got six regulatory observations on its Halol factory in Gujarat from the US Food and Drug Administration, the company said, adding that it would respond in two weeks.
“The USFDA conducted a pre-approval inspection (PAI) of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries’ Halol facility from August 27, 2018 to August 31, 2018,” the company said, adding that the inspection concluded with the regulator issuing a Form 483 with six observations. 
The US regulator makes Form 483 observations when companies don’t adhere to procedures outlined in the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) norms. Companies are expected to revert with their remedial action. But the issue could escalate if the action does not meet with the approval of the regulator. And Halol being an important plant for Sun Pharma, the regulatory action brings in an element of uncertainty. 
Earlier this week, the USFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb outlined his agency’s efforts to ensure that quality products got into the US market from foreign drug manufacturing facilities. “Over the past 25 years, globalisation of drug manufacturing has prompted the FDA to change its regulatory landscape,” he said, and as manufacturing of drugs and their components shifted to overseas production facilities, it brought in new complexities. “The FDA took steps to keep pace,” he added. 
“We’ve established a framework to assure that all drug products meet the same high-quality standards, regardless of where they’re manufactured; and whether they’re brand-name or generic products, or prescription or over-the-counter drugs,” he said.
To bring in greater transparency around its site selection model, the agency is publishing a policy on how manufacturing facilities are prioritised and scheduled for surveillance inspections. “Our policy explains how a facility’s compliance history, recall trends, time since last inspection, inherent risk of the drug being manufactured, processing complexity and other factors are all weighed and considered,” he said.
In the financial year 2017, there were about 5,063 human pharmaceutical sites worldwide, subject to routine surveillance inspection — 3,025 of those were foreign-based. For that year, the FDA conducted 1,453 drug surveillance inspections, including 762 on foreign soil to ensure manufacturers were followingCGMP requirements and maintaining high quality standards, the note said."

 Drug major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries on Friday said it has received approval from the Australian health regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), for its speciality product, ILUMYA (tildrakizumab), used for the treatment of adults with plaque psoriasis.
“We are pleased to have received this approval and look forward to bringing ILUMYA to dermatologists and patients in Australia,” Sun Pharma Business Head, Western Europe and Australia, Hellen De Kloet, said in a statement.
The company said ILUMYA is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to tildrakizumab or to any of the excipients in ILUMYA, and in patients with clinically important active infections such as active tuberculosis.
“We are launching a patient support programme to assist patients prescribed with ILUMYA. The programme is designed to supplement the support offered by doctors in their practice or in hospital departments,” she added.
ILUMYA is one of the key speciality products of Sun Pharma and it was approved by the US health regulator, USFDA, in March 2018, while the European Commission approved it in September 2018.
Sun Pharma said, in Australia, the number of severe chronic plaque psoriasis patients receiving treatment through the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) with biologics, increased by more than 60 per cent between 2014 and 2016.
However, the number treated was less than 30 per cent of the severely affected population. The total PBS expenditure on biologicals for chronic plaque psoriasis (at published prices) was Australian dollars 121 million in 2016.

 Sun Pharma expects its India business to stabilise in the current fiscal leading to “reasonable volume growth” after witnessing disruptions in 2017-18 due to GST implementation, a top company official said.
 In a message to shareholders in the company’s Annual Report for 2017-18, Sun Pharma Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi however said the government’s enforced price cuts and policy changes are potential risk factors for the business.
 “We expect normalisation of the India business in 2018-19 post the disruption in 2017-18 due to GST implementation. Favourable demographics will ensure reasonable volume growth in India,” Shanghvi said.
 However, government-mandated price reductions/policy changes continue to be potential risks for this business, he added. 
The company’s India business revenues stood at Rs 8,029 crore in 2017-18, a growth of 4 per cent over 2016-17. 
 Shanghvi said the short-term outlook for the US generics market continues to be challenging given the pricing pressures.
 “We are also expecting reasonable growth in our emerging markets business, however, as always, currency fluctuations continue to be a risk,” he added.
The Mumbai-based drug firm posted consolidated revenues of Rs 26,489.46 crore for 2017-18.

 Assam government on Saturday said medicine firm Sun Pharma will invest an additional Rs 200 crore at its plant in the state to augment operations.
 Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Saturday inaugurated a new production line at Sun Pharma’s facility in Palashbari.
 “The company has already invested Rs 700 crore in this manufacturing facility in the state and another Rs 200 crore is going to be invested,” an official release from Chief Minister’s Office said.

 Drug major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Tuesday reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 218.82 crore for the July-September quarter on account of a Rs 1,214-crore provision for the settlement of the Modafinil antitrust case in the US. 
 The company had posted a net profit of Rs 912.12 crore for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, company said in a BSE filing.
 After accounting for the provision of Rs 1,214 crore for the estimated settlement amount payable to all the remaining plaintiffs related to the Modafinil antitrust litigation in the US, the net loss for the quarter was at Rs 219 crore, it said.
 The company had entered into settlement with some complainants in the antitrust case last year.
Adjusted net profit for the second quarter of FY19 was at Rs 996 crore with resulting adjusted net profit margin at 14.5 per cent.
 Consolidated revenue from operations of the company stood at Rs 6,846.48 crore for the quarter under consideration. It was Rs 6,590.06 crore for the same period a year ago.
 On the results, Sun Pharma MD Dilip Shanghvi said: “Our soft Q2 performance is not a reflection of the underlying health of the overall business. We continue to focus on strengthening our core operations and enhancing our overall efficiencies. We are fairly positive on our performance for the rest of the year. We are excited with the successful launch of Ilumya in the US.” 
Sale of branded formulations in India for the second quarter of FY19 was at Rs 1,860 crore, down by 16 per cent mainly due to a planned one-time inventory reduction in the supply chain coupled with a higher base of second quarter last year, Sun Pharma said. 
 Sales in the US were at $342 million (around Rs 2,484 crore) for the quarter, a growth of 11 per cent over same period last year and accounting for 35 per cent of the total sales for the quarter, it added.
 The company’s sales in emerging markets were at $195 million (around 1,416 crore) for the quarter under consideration, flat over same quarter last year, Sun Pharma said.
 Formulation sales in Rest of World (ROW) markets excluding US and emerging markets were at $108 million (around Rs 784 crore) in second quarter of FY19, a de-growth of 2 per cent from the same qurter last year, it added.
“Our API business imparts benefits of vertical integration for our formulations business. We continue to increase the API supply for captive consumption for key products. For Q2 FY19, external sales of API were at Rs 426 crore, up by 10 per cent over Q2 last year,” Sun Pharma said.
 Consolidated research and development expense for the second quarter of the current fiscal was Rs 452 crore, 6.6 per cent of sales compared to Rs 511 crore (7.7 per cent) of sales for the second quarter of the last year, it added.

 Sun Pharma said it will acquire Japan-based Pola Pharma for around $1 million to strengthen its presence in dermatology segment across the globe.
 The company has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pola Pharma, which is engaged in research and development, manufacture, sale and distribution of branded and generic products in Japan, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said in a statement.
 Pola Pharma’s portfolio mainly comprises dermatology products. It has two manufacturing facilities in Saitama with capabilities to manufacture topical products and injectables.
 It also has R&D capabilities to develop new technologies and formulations.
“This acquisition is in line with our strategy to strengthen our global dermatology presence. Pola Pharma is a leading dermatology company and it will help us launch our speciality and generic dermatology products in the Japanese market in future,” Sun Pharma Executive Vice-President Kirti Ganorkar said.
 Sun Pharma Japan Country Head, Junichi Nakamichisaid, said that by combining its global strengths with Pola Pharma’s local expertise, the company will have a great opportunity to further strengthen its presence in Japan, especially in dermatology.
 Pola Pharma had an annual revenue of around $108 million and net loss of $7 million for the 12 months ended December 2017 on consolidated basis.
“The equity consideration, on debt-free and cash-free basis, for the 100 per cent stake in Pola Pharma is around $1 million,” Sun Pharma said.
 The transaction is expected to close on or before January 31, 2019, subject to completion of closing conditions, it added.
 Sun Pharma forayed into the Japanese prescription market in 2016, with the acquisition of 14 established prescription brands from Novartis. The size of the Japanese pharmaceutical market is estimated at USD 84.8 billion, accounting for around 7.5 per cent of the $1.13-trillion global pharmaceutical market.

Sun Pharma shares rallied over 2 per cent in intra-day trade on Thursday after the company said its US arm had been granted relief in a patent infringement case. 
Massachusetts-based DUSA has been granted preliminary injunctive relief by a federal district court prohibiting defendants Biofrontera Inc, Biofrontera Bioscience GmbH, Biofrontera Pharma GmbH, and Biofrontera AGf from using its confidential and proprietary trade secret information, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.
Earlier this year, DUSA, which is wholly-owned by Sun Pharma, filed a lawsuit against the Biofrontera defendants in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The lawsuit alleged trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement of DUSA’s photodynamic therapy patents covering its product.

The lawsuit sought an assessment of both damages and injunctive relief against the Biofrontera defendants, Sun Pharma said.

“Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc.

Responding to concerns raised then on whether deal-street had got wind of Sun’s buy in advance, Makov had told BusinessLine, “there was no insider trading, that’s for sure.”
Questions were asked then because Ranbaxy’s share price saw a spike in the run-up to the deal, and Sun, through a subsidiary, had invested in it.
ALSO READ: Uncertainties continue to cast a shadow on Sun Pharma
Four years on, insider trading charges and more have come back to haunt Sun Pharma and they look unlikely to go away just yet, even as promoter and Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi sought to clarify the company’s position to allay investor fears.
A whistle-blower has reportedly raised corporate governance issues in Sun Pharma with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). But Shanghvi, in an investor call on Monday evening, said they had not heard from the market regulator on the whistle-blower report nor on a likely re-opening of a probe on insider trading charges.
Addressing the alleged whistle-blower’s concerns on irregularities and other alleged discrepancies flagged recently by brokerage firm Macquarie, Shanghvi said the company had not faltered on corporate governance.
Some allegations like lending to four individuals without a security, he said, were 20 years old, and in some cases, the laws had changed since. Responding to Sun’s domestic formulations business being routed through related entity Aditya Medisales Ltd (AML), Shanghvi indicated that the management was willing to assess its corporate engagement with the entity if investors were not comfortable with the present structure. AML had become a related party only in FY18, he said.
However, a veteran market-hand who listened in to Sun Pharma’s investor call said that Shanghvi should have given details, for instance, on the loans and advances of about ₹1,800 crore given in FY18. Questions have been raised by analysts on these loans extended to non-related parties, that have seen an increase last year.
Recalling the Ranbaxy investment, another analyst said that questions keep popping up around the investments made by Sudhir Valia through entities he is engaged in. Valia is Shanghvi’s brother-in-law. One such question doing the rounds this time involves Lakshdeep Investments & Finance and why it was not considered a promoter entity? “Lakshdeep is an investment company of Sudhir Valia. As per the then legal advice we received, we classified the same as a non-promoter entity and disclosures were made accordingly. However, even if it were to be classified as a promoter entity, it does not materially change the current promoter shareholding,” the management said. However, since the concern has been raised, they added, “we are in the process of seeking a revised legal opinion on this matter.”
On the relationship between Orbit Investment Services and Investment Trust of India, Sun clarified that “investments made by these entities may be private investments made by independent parties, which the company is not privy to.”
Clarifying on a string of other allegations, the company said, it had not been involved in any insider trading norm violations relating to the Ranbaxy deal. There was a minor technical issue relating to a procedural aspect of trading window closure due to intervening holidays. But since SEBI later ruled that Sun should have announced a window closure, “This case was settled with SEBI with no admission of guilt in accordance with the provisions of applicable laws and matter was closed.” Media reports said top Sun management paid ₹18 lakh to settle the probe.
With uncertainties continuing to cast a shadow on Sun Pharma, investors await the next move from SEBI, even as they worry if more skeletons could tumble out of the cupboard."

At the end of market hours, the stock fell 8.51 per cent or Rs 36.30 at Rs 390.25 on the NSE.
The complaint, sent to the capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), is the second in over a month, according to a report.
The whistleblower complaint alleges that an Indian pharmaceutical manufacturer Aditya Medisales Ltd had transactions with Suraksha Realty, controlled by Sun Pharma's co-promoter, Sudhir Valia, the report stated.
The transactions took place between 2014 and 2017, and were worth over Rs 5,800 crore ($814.65 million), it added.
A whistleblower had approached SEBI late last year with a document alleging various irregularities by Sun Pharma, its promoter Dilip Shanghvi and others.
Sun Pharma did not immediately respond to a Reuters request seeking comment.
Shares of the country's largest drugmaker by market value recorded their biggest intra-day percentage drop since May 29, 2017.
Over 31.4 million shares changed hands, around 2.7 times Sun's 30-day trading volume average of 11.7 million shares.
Earlier this month, Sun Pharma had recalled muscle relaxtant vecuronium bromide for injection due to the presence of glass."
37,2019-01-18,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma alleges unfair business practices against it, seeks SEBI intervention 
 Sun Pharmaceutical Industries on Friday asked the markets regulator SEBI to look into the issues of certain entities and individuals allegedly adopting unfair trade practices prejudicial to the company’s shareholders.
Against the backdrop of reports that a second whistle-blower complaint has been filed against it and shares taking a beating on the exchanges, Sun Pharma has written to SEBI flagging concerns that certain entities are allegedly adopting unfair trade practices.
In a letter to SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi, the Mumbai-based drug maker said it has come to know from a media report that a second whistle-blower complaint has been filed against the company.
“We are concerned that certain entities/ individuals are adopting unfair trade practices prejudicial to the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders,” the company said in the letter, a copy of which has been submitted to the stock exchanges.
In a clarification to BSE, the company said it has not received the alleged “172-page whistle-blower complaint” and, therefore, it is not privy to the contents of the document being referred to in the said media article. 
“Hence, we cannot comment on the points being raised in the said media article,” it said. In November 2018, a whistle-blower approached SEBI with a document alleging various irregularities by the company, its promoter and others. 
Referring to the latest reports, Sun Pharma said it is evident that shareholder value has been drastically eroded within a short span of time due to “unsubstantiated complaint/ allegation” against the company and a malafide campaign launched by certain media houses.
“We request your office to examine the matter in its entirety, and the role of some media houses and other stakeholders,” the drug maker said.
According to Sun Pharma, the said whistle-blower documents and other confidential e-mails are being offered for inspection to institutional investors by one media house as per the above report, which again the company is not privy to.
“In these circumstances, there is a great asymmetry in the information circulating between analysts, investors and media, leading to intense speculation.
“The availability of information contained in the whistle-blower documents to a set of selective investors does put other investors, including retail investors, in a disadvantageous position,” the letter said.
Shares of Sun Pharma came under massive selling pressure on Friday, plummeting over 8 per cent, that wiped out Rs 8,735 crore from its market valuation, amid reports of fresh allegations by a whistle-blower against the company.
The stock crashed 8.52 per cent to end the day at Rs 390.75 on BSE. During the day, it dived 12.11 per cent to hit its multi-year low of Rs 375.40.
At the National Stock Exchange (NSE), shares of the company plunged 8.51 per cent to close at Rs 390.25 apiece.
Led by the sharp fall in the stock, the company’s market valuation declined by Rs 8,735.71 crore to Rs 93,751.44 crore on BSE. The stock was the worst hit among the blue-chips on both the BSE and NSE.
In terms of equity volume, 66.72 lakh shares of the company were traded on the BSE and 8.29 crore shares changed hands on NSE during the day. On Thursday, the stock had fallen 5.77 per cent on the BSE."

 Indian drug majors Lupin, Sun Pharma and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals are recalling various drugs from the US market for a variety of reasons.
As per the latest Enforcement Report published by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), Lupin is voluntarily recalling 55,000 vials and 1,60,241 boxes of anti-bacterial drug Ceftriaxone for injection in various strengths.
The recall has been initiated by Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of the Mumbai-based firm. The products have been manufactured at the company’s facility in Mandideep, Madhya Pradesh. The company is recalling specific lots of drugs due to the presence of particulate matter. “Product complaints received of grey flecks, identified as shredded rubber particulate matter from the stopper observed in reconstituted vials,” USFDA said.
The ongoing voluntary nationwide recall has been classified as Class-I. Such recalls are for dangerous or defective products that predictably could cause serious health problems. Lupin Pharmaceuticals is also recalling 2,87,784 bottles of Cefdinir for Oral Suspension, used to treat bacterial infections, for CGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) deviations.
The USFDA has classified it as a Class-II recall, which is initiated in a “situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote“.
Similarly, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is voluntarily recalling 13,918 cartons and 1,39,180 vials of Vecuronium Bromide for Injection, used as part of general anesthesia, due to presence of particulate matter. Besides, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals is recalling 96,240 applicators of its product Estradiol Vaginal Inserts for defective delivery system. The USFDA has termed it as a Class-II recall."

Drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd said on Tuesday it will make its unit the new distributor for its domestic formulations business, replacing Aditya Medisales Ltd.
The company had last week asked capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to look into a media report about an alleged complaint by a whistleblower relating to certain transactions involving the company and its co-promoter that had led to a sell-off in the company's shares.
The whistleblower had alleged that Sun Pharma's distributor Aditya Medisales had transactions worth more than Rs 58 billion ($814.31 million) with Suraksha Realty, controlled by Sun's co-promoter Sudhir Valia, a report by Moneylife magazine said. Reuters was unable to review the document.
Shares rose as much as 4.3 per cent in early trade on Tuesday, posting their biggest daily percentage gain since December 11, with investors welcoming the development. Sun Pharma did not name the unit replacing Aditya Medisales in its statement to exchanges, but said the change will be effective by the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The drugmaker also denied giving any loans or guarantees to Suraksha Realty, adding that it does not have any financial deals with the Mumbai-based company.
As of March 31 2018, Sun Pharma owed Rs 22.38 billion to Atlas Global Trading for damages related to a patent litigation settlement. Atlas will assign its rights and obligations to one of Sun Pharma's unit, settling all loans to Atlas. ($1 = INR 71.2260)"
32,2019-01-22,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma rises 6% after domestic formulations distributor is replaced with own arm
Shares of Sun Pharmaceuticals on Tuesday surged over 6 per cent after it replaced its domestic formulations distributor, Aditya Medisales, with its own subsidiary, in the backdrop of a second whistle-blower complaint filed against the company.
On the BSE, the stock gained 6.12 per cent to Rs 422.75. Similarly, on the NSE, the stock rallied 6.32 per cent to its intra-day high of Rs 423.50. The stock closed with nearly 2 per cent gains on Monday.
Sun Pharma closed the day at Rs 418.05 , up Rs 19.70 (+4.95%) on the BSE. It was at Rs 417.40, up Rs 19.10 or up on the NSE.
“Sun Pharma’s distribution related to India’s domestic formulations business shall be transitioned from Aditya Medisales Ltd, the current distributor, to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma,” the company said in a regulatory filing.
Sun Pharma said this change will be made effective by the first quarter of 2019-20, post receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals.
The company also announced unwinding of a transaction amounting to Rs 2,238 crore with Atlas Global Trading and initiated steps to induct SRBC & Co LLP, its statutory auditors, as auditors of subsidiaries.
Last week, Sun Pharmaceutical asked the markets regulator SEBI to look into the issue of certain entities and individuals allegedly adopting unfair trade practices prejudicial to the company’s shareholders.
Amid reports that a second whistle-blower complaint has been filed against it and with its shares taking a beating on the exchanges, Sun Pharma had written to SEBI flagging concerns that certain entities were allegedly adopting unfair trade practices."
31,2019-01-22,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma’s damage-control exercise does not quell the many concerns
In its third major clarification in two months, drug-maker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries has said that it was making a few operational changes involving its domestic distributor for finished medicines and auditor of its subsidiaries, among others. 
The move attempts to quell whistle-blower and investor concerns and the associated price volatility around its stock. Sun Pharma’s stock price had fallen over 12 per cent on Friday but has since recovered to end Tuesday, up almost 5 per cent at ₹418 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. 
Market-watchers, though, are divided on whether Sun’s clarifications take issues head-on or end up confirming some of their worst fears. 
Sun on Tuesday said that it has “transitioned” the distribution of its domestic formulations business from Aditya Medisales Ltd (AML), its current distributor, to a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma. The change will become effective by the first quarter of FY20, after regulatory approvals were received. 
Last month, Sun Pharma promoter and Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi had indicated that a distribution change could be considered by the management, as questions had been raised on routing domestic finished drugs through a related entity. AML had become a related party only in FY18, he had said.
Explaining its transaction with third party Atlas Global, Sun said that its consolidated balance sheet (as on March 31,2018) had reflected a liability towards obligation of supplies to Atlas Global Trading amounting to ₹2,238 crore ($345 million). 
“This liability was in respect of Atlas assuming the damages on account of Protonix patent litigation settlement entered by Sun Pharma which was disclosed in Sun Pharma’s Annual Report FY14,” Sun clarified.
But some analysts question why this disclosure was being made only after much prodding. “The amount involved is over ₹2,200 crore. This should have been said upfront in a transparent manner and not tucked away in an annual report,” an analyst said, adding that his discomfort was similar with the disclosure on AML as well. 
Sun explains that its Halol facility (Gujarat) came under the US Food and Drug Administration’s scanner over its Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) in September 2014. This was resolved in June 2018, nearly 4 years later.
“The parties to the supply contract have now agreed in principle, that Atlas will assign its rights and obligations arising from this contract, to a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma. This assignment will ensure that the Loans & Advances given to Atlas will be settled. On conclusion of this transaction, in the consolidated balance sheet, this loan and the obligation will cease to exist as it gets squared up. This transaction is expected to be concluded in FY19,” it added. 
Addressing other investor sore points, Sun said it had initiated efforts to induct SRBC & CO LLP, its statutory auditors, as auditors of its subsidiaries as well, presently audited by Valia & Timbadia. But on the contentious loans or guarantees to Suraksha Realty, Sun Pharma said, “neither any loans nor guarantees have been given to Suraksha Realty.” Shanghvi’s brother-in-law is Sudhir Valia is part of the “dream team” of Suraksha Reality."

Drug major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries on Tuesday reported a nearly four-fold jump in its consolidated net profit at Rs 1,241.85 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.
The company had posted a net profit of Rs 321.57 crore for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, hit by a one-time deferred tax adjustment.
“Net profit for Q3 FY19 was at Rs 1,242 crore, with the resulting net profit margin at 16.2 per cent. Net profit for the third quarter last year was adversely impacted by one-time deferred tax adjustment of Rs 513 crore related to changes in the US tax rates. Adjusted for this, net profit growth for Q3 FY19 was 49 per cent year-on-year,” Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said in a filing to the BSE.
Consolidated revenue from operations of the company stood at Rs 7,740.19 crore for the quarter under consideration, as against Rs 6,653.23 crore for the same period a year ago.
Commenting on the results, Sun Pharma MD Dilip Shanghvi said: “Our focus on execution is reflected in the Q3 performance.” 
The company remains committed towards executing its global speciality strategy, strengthening core operations and enhancing its overall efficiencies, he added.
“The Ilumya launch in US has been well received by doctors. We recently commercialised Xelpros in the US and are preparing to launch Cequa in the coming months,” Shanghvi said.
Sales of branded formulations in India were at Rs 2,235 crore in the October-December quarter of 2018-19, up by 7 per cent and accounting for 29 per cent of total sales, Sun Pharma said.
Sales in the US were at $362 million for the quarter under consideration, a growth of 10 per cent over the same period last year and accounted for 34 per cent of total sales, it added.
“Our sales in emerging markets were at $203 million for Q3; up 7 per cent over the same quarter last year and accounted for 19 per cent of total sales,” Sun Pharma said.
Formulation sales in the Rest of World (ROW) markets, excluding the US and emerging markets, were at $125 million in the third quarter of 2018-19, a growth of 4 per cent over the year-ago quarter and accounting for approximately 12 per cent of revenues, it added.

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd has responded to a couple of queries from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the drugmaker’s Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi told analysts here on Tuesday while discussing the company’s financial performance for Q3 FY19.
While the company has still to access the whistleblower report, it has responded to two queries from SEBI on its 2004 FCCB issue and its transaction with Aditya Medisales Ltd, Shanghvi said in his opening remarks, addressing recent corporate governance concerns being asked by investors against the backdrop of the whistleblower submission.
Responding to whether AML had benefited at the cost of minority shareholders, Shanghvi clarified that Sun shareholders had not been “disadvantaged” because of the AML transaction. He reiterated Sun’s recent statement on transitioning the distribution of its domestic formulations business from Aditya Medisales Ltd (AML), its current distributor, to a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma. The change will become effective by the first quarter of FY20, he added. 
The company management also clarified on Sun’s transaction with third party Atlas Global. Sun’s consolidated balance sheet (as on March 31,2018) had reflected a liability towards obligation of supplies to Atlas Global Trading amounting to Rs2,238 crore ($345 million). “This liability was in respect of Atlas assuming the damages on account of Protonix patent litigation settlement entered by Sun Pharma,” the company had said. The company was in the process of unwinding this transaction and Atlas would assign its rights and obligations to a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun, the company's top brass said. 
Sun Pharma net profit for the three months under review stood at ₹1,242 crore, reflecting an “adjusted” growth of 49 per cent, as last year’s net profit for the same period had been adversely impacted by a one-time deferred tax adjustment of ₹513 crore related to changes in US tax rates.
Sun’s income from operations was ₹7,657 crore, a 16 per cent growth from the same period last year. The company’s India sales grew 7 per cent at ₹2,235 crore. Its US finished dosage sales were at $362 million was up 10 per cent; emerging markets sales were at $203 million, up 7 per cent; and its rest of the world sales were at $ 125 million, up 4 per cent.
Its R&D investments stood at ₹465 crore (at 6.1 per cent of sales), compared to ₹473 crore (7.2 per cent of sales) for Q3 FY18. Sun had taken back unviable product applications for the US in the quarter, Shanghvi said, adding that the generic drugs landscape would be critically evaluated.
But research spending was expected to increase next year on account of clinical trials on Ilumya for new indications."

 Sun Pharma group’s senior executive, Abhay Arvind Gandhi, and his wife Kiran have settled with SEBI a case related to insider trading in shares of Ranbaxy Laboratories in 2014. Both have paid a total of over Rs 70 lakh as settlement charges.
At the time of alleged violation, Abhay Arvind Gandhi was the CEO of Sun Pharma Laboratories Ltd (SPLL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Currently, Abhay Gandhi is CEO of Sun Pharma’s North America business.
Gandhi and his wife traded in Ranbaxy shares soon after Japanese major Daiichi, in 2014, agreed to sell Ranbaxy to Sun Pharma.
According to separate notices sent to the two individuals, they had traded in the shares of Ranbaxy when the proposed deal was to be made public. The proposed deal was UPSI (Unpublished Price Sensitive Information) from February 14, 2014 to April 6, 2014.
By trading in the shares of Ranbaxy during the UPSI period, both allegedly violated prohibition of insider trading norms, according to the notices. As Gandhi was then the chief of SPLL, he and his wife were insiders under SEBI norms.
Gandhi and Kiran traded in 454 shares and 6,770 shares, respectively, during the UPSI period.
In two separate but similarly-worded orders issued on Thursday, SEBI said the two individuals sought to settle the adjudication proceedings initiated against them in 2017.
Under SEBI’s settlement mechanism, without admission or denial of guilt, both proposed to pay Rs 35.06 lakh each to settle the case.
The settlement amounts proposed were approved by a panel of SEBI’s Whole-Time Members, according to the two orders.
While settling the case, the regulator also said enforcement actions could be initiated if any representation made by the two individuals is found to be untrue."
35,2019-04-11,Sun Pharma,"Tanking shares and a new bout of questions plague Sun Pharma
Sun Pharmaceuticals’ 12.7 per cent drop in share-price on Friday has raised a fresh bout of questions on activities surrounding India’s largest drugmaker.
The tanking share price, market-watchers said was linked to revelations last week of a second whistle blower report that was submitted to market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). However, the article that revealed these details had come out early last week, while the company’s shares tanked two days later.
The stock market is a dynamic creature reacting to rumours and news developments instantly, said seasoned market-watchers, raising red-flags on the delayed reaction in this case and what might have indeed triggered it.
SEBI had in December acknowledged that they had received a whistle blower report against Sun Pharma and were examining it. Responding to whether the company has received a show cause from SEBI, Sun Pharma’s spokesperson said, “We have received two queries from SEBI which the company has responded to. We are not in a position to comment as to whether the queries are related to the whistle blower complaint.”
“The markets-regulator needs to act to clear the confusion around Sun Pharma,” said Arun Kejriwal, Founder, Kejriwal Research and Investment Services (KRIS). While analysts wonder why a show cause notice has not been issued to the company on the allegations, Kejriwal said that the regulator must investigate the volume of trade on Friday. “Looking at the company’s performance over the years, there seems to be no concern on its fundamentals for the present. But it also depends on how deep the corporate governance issues are,” he added.
Sun has been under a cloud since news on the first whistle blower report came out last November. The development was followed by Sun Pharma’s management explaining their actions in the light of allegations made by the whistle blower.
In its complaint, the whistle blower has reportedly raised corporate governance and insider trading issues involving the company.
In an analyst-call in December, Sun Pharma promoter and Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi had said that they did not receive any information from the market regulator about the whistle-blower report or about the possible reopening of a probe on insider trading charges.
The company has seen insider-trading allegations levelled against it when it had acquired troubled drugmaker Ranbaxy in 2014 for $4 billion. Its top-management had then denied the allegations.
This time around, the whistle blower has reportedly red-flagged other discrepancies including routing its domestic formulations business through a related entity Aditya Medisales Ltd (AML). Responding to these allegations, Shanghvi said that the management was willing to assess its corporate engagement with the entity if investors were not comfortable with its present structure. AML had become a related party only in FY18, he had said.
Market-watchers say that Shanghvi’s earlier call had not entirely put all questions to rest. In fact, many were left seeking more details on the increased loans and advances extended to non-related parties.
Other niggling concerns that often crops up around Sun Pharma involve the transactions by Sudhir Valia through entities he is engaged in. Valia is Shanghvi’s brother-in-law.
An analyst puts the spotlight on SEBI and how it chooses to act next, given the recent intense activity around Sun Pharma and its stock."

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is scouting for a partner in China to help it win a larger piece of the worlds second-largest drug market, where the government is on a mission to drive down healthcare costs.
With recovery underway in its U.S. business, Sun Pharma’s billionaire founder Dilip Shanghvi is honing in on China and believes market watchers are underestimating the potential there for India’s largest drugmaker. There is a big opportunity for us, Shanghvi said in an interview with Bloomberg in Mumbai on Thursday. That would create a significant new revenue stream, which is not factored in our valuation when analysts look at it.
China has rolled out an ambitious multi-city bulk procurement program that is driving down prices and providing an opening for Indian manufacturers like Sun Pharma to compete. Its importing more drugs, reimbursing more and speeding up approvals of new medicines to ensure they reach patients faster.
The policy push comes as many generic drug makers are still reeling from a brutal price war in the worlds biggest drug market, the US. While Sun Pharma’s Indian rivals, like Dr. Reddys Laboratories and Cipla are already expanding in the Asian nation, Shanghvi has mostly kept mum about his plans there.
Scaling up
The Sun Pharma will start scaling up its China business in six to nine months, according to Shanghvi. The unit will contribute some percentage to Suns $4 billion of overall sales within three years from almost nothing right now, he added. The $160 billion Chinese drug market is now a focus for Indian generics as US-approved drugs are cleared faster, Jefferies analyst Piyush Nahar wrote in a February 27 note.
While the reforms make China an attractive market, ramp-up and profitability will have significant challenges, Nahar wrote. Unlike US distribution is important in China and will need a local partner and higher spend. Analysts are split on the prospects of Sun Pharma’s stock, which has lagged the rise in the S&P BSE Sensex this year. In the last four years, it has plummeted nearly 52 percent compared to the Sensexs 42 percent climb.
Sun Pharma’s large portfolio of US-approved products should help the drugmaker ramp up its China business with little investment, Shanghvi said. We see enormous interest in China for products that we have global rights for, Shanghvi said, adding that the company would be comfortable making significant financial commitments, in the Asian nation longer term."

In fact, the drugmaker on Monday said that Raksha Valia, wife of Sudhir Valia, Sun Pharma’s executive director and brother-in-law of founder Dilip Shanghvi, revoked or released pledged shares on May 7.
Nearly 19.3 lakh shares held by Valia and pledged with Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund were released, according to the filing.
She held 1.41 per cent in Sun Pharma. Her pledged holding fell from 99.87 per cent as of March to 94 per cent after the release of pledged shares.
Similarly, on May 6, the company said Sanghi Finance had released 43.75 lakh shares of pledged shares on April 25 in respect of commercial papers; 21 lakh shares and 15 shares on April 26 by lender Julius Baer Capital (India) as a security for loan availed by the third party.
Sun Pharma’s stock has dropped 7.85 per cent so far this year compared with a 2.83 per cent rise in the BSE Sensex. The stock has been under pressure, due to corporate governance, especially loans to a third party and the delayed disclosure of the promoter’s link to a distributor. According to HDFC Securities, the key watchouts for the company are: specialty product pipeline and R&D spend; updates on approvals and launches; and clarity on SEBI investigation related to corporate governance issues.
The company is expected to grow at nearly 6 per cent y-o-y affected by a higher US-base and inventory adjustment in India business, said HDFC Securities in its Q4 preview. “Sequentially, we see a 4 per cent drop,” it added. The broking house further said it expects EBITDA margin to contract due to sticky spend on the US, specialty business and a one-time impact on account of lower India sales.
Th board of Sun Pharma is scheduled to meet on May 28 to consider and approve audited standalone and consolidated financial results of the company for the fourth quarter and year ended March 31, 2019."

20,2019-05-29,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma’s India revenue takes a hit on distribution change
Drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said that its income from operations took a one-time impact of about ₹1,085 crore due to the change of its distribution in India. 
Sun had announced in January that it would transition its domestic distribution from Aditya Medisales, a promoter-owned entity, to a wholly owned subsidiary. 
The move was to quell corporate governance concerns raised by a whistle-blower and the investor community. 
Sun’s sales from operations stood at ₹7,044 crores for the quarter ended March 31, a growth of 5 per cent over the same period last year. 
The company’s India sales at ₹1,101 crores was down 44 per cent over the quarter last year. Sun posted a net profit of ₹636 crore for the quarter under review. 
This was not comparable with Q4 of last year, due to the one-time impact resulting from the India distribution change as well as the one-time tax benefit of ₹259 crore for same quarter last year, the company said.
Sun Pharma Chairman and MD Dilip Shanghvi told analysts that there was no further update on the whistle-blower complaint that had been made to SEBI. 
On recent reports of price-collusion litigation in the US, where seven Indian companies and Sun’s Taro had been named, Shanghvi said that the suit is without merit and Taro will continue to defend its position.
 A filing by the company to the BSE also noted the change in designation of Sudhir Valia, who stepped down from the position of full-time director of the company to non-executive director from May 29, 2019. 
Valia is Shanghvi’s brother-in-law, and some of his transactions had also become a point of concern for investors and market-watchers and had been raised by the whistle-blower.
In a statement on annual numbers, Shanghvi said: “In spite of the one-time impact for India business, our full year sales have grown by double digits. We continue to focus on executing our global specialty strategy. Ilumya is expected to gradually gain traction in US in FY20 while the Cequa launch is expected in the coming months. At the same time, we are strengthening our core operations, optimising the cost structure and enhancing our overall efficiencies.” 
Sun’s annual sales for the year ended March 31, 2019 stood at at ₹28,686 crore, a growth of 10 per cent over last year. 
Its net profit stood at ₹2,665 crore for the period under review. 
The US finished-dosage sales clocked $1,526 million, up by 12 per cent over last year."

 Sudhir Valia, brother-in-law of Sun Pharma’s Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi, has stepped down from the position of whole-time director but will continue as non-executive director of the company, a regulatory filing said.
The pharma major in a filing on Tuesday said Valia will step down from the position of the company’s whole-time director to non-executive, non-independent director from May 29, 2019.
Asked for the reasons for Valia shifting to a non-executive role, a Sun Pharma spokesperson said: “As his personal businesses are increasingly taking more of his time, he has decided to give up the role of a whole-time director in the company.” 
Earlier in January 2019, Sun Pharma had said that it had not given any loans nor guarantees to Suraksha Realty, a company in which Valia is one of the promoters.

18,2019-06-02,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma hovers above a key support 
Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
What are the short and long-term views for Sun Pharmaceutical and Aditya Birla Fashion?
Pradeeo Kabra
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (₹409.5): The stock of Sun Pharma has been in a long-term downtrend since recording a new high of ₹1,200 in April 2015. Both the medium as well as short-term trends are down. The stock hovers well below its 50 and 200-day moving averages.
In early May, it tumbled sharply and registered a 52-week low at ₹350, but bounced up, recovering the loss and managed to close in the significant support band between ₹390 and ₹400.
This band cushions the stock. There has also been an increase in daily volumes over the last three weeks. The daily indicators show mixed trends.
An upward reversal from the current support band is possible in the short term. This can take the stock up to ₹450 and ₹480 in the medium term.
A strong break above ₹500 is needed to alter the medium-term downtrend and take the stock up to ₹550 and ₹600 over the long term.
Subsequent resistance is placed at ₹665 levels. On the other hand, a strong plunge below ₹390 can drag the stock down to ₹350 in the short term. Next key supports are at ₹330 and ₹300.
Investors with a long-term perspective can stay invested and buy in declines with a stop-loss at ₹340.










Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail (₹211.5): Since taking support from the long-term base in the ₹125-135 band in July 2018, the stock has been in an intermediate-term uptrend. However, it encountered a key resistance at ₹235 this March and began to decline. The stock has been in a short-term downtrend since then.
Key resistance at ₹220 is limiting the stock. On Friday, the stock fell almost 3 per cent forming a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern at the key hurdle of ₹220. This is a bearish reversal pattern with bearish implications. The indicators in the daily chart displays mixed signs. The stock can continue to trend down and remain in the downtrend as long as it trades below ₹220.
A strong fall below the key support at ₹190 will reinforce the downtrend and drag the stock down to ₹175. A further fall below ₹175 will alter the intermediate-term uptrend and pull the stock lower to ₹150 and ₹140 in the medium term.
Conversely, an emphatic break above the near-term resistance level of ₹220 will alter the downtrend and take the stock up to ₹230 and ₹235 levels. A rally beyond ₹235 will strengthen the uptrend and accelerate the stock northwards to ₹250 and ₹263 in the long run. Investors with a long-term horizon can stay invested with a stop-loss at ₹160.

 Drug major Sun Pharma on Saturday said it is discontinuing operations at two clinical pharmacology units in Vadodara (Gujarat) to bring in efficiencies in cost and processes.
“While we continue to make investments in our R&D operations, we also constantly evaluate our resources and future capacity requirements to bring in efficiencies in cost and processes,” a Sun Pharmaceutical Industries spokesperson said in a statement.
To ensure optimal utilisation of clinical pharmacology units (CPUs) that conduct bio-equivalence studies, the company is discontinuing operations at two centers at Tandalja and Akota in Vadodara, the spokesperson added. “The bio-equivalence studies from these centers will be transferred to our other facilities. We are offering full support to the affected employees and helping them with out placement services,” the spokesperson said.

12,2019-08-14,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma Q1: Stock falls despite strong operational performance
Markets don’t seem to be impressed by the good set of numbers from Sun Pharma.
The stock of the company has declined over 6 per cent since morning today despite the company having reported strong operational performance for the first quarter of 2019-20.
It appears that the investors are vary on the sustainability of Q1 performance in the coming quarters. 
The consolidated total revenues of the company grew by 16 percent to Rs 8,374 crore in the June quarter as against Rs 7,224 crore seen in the same period last year. Its consolidated net profit rose by 31 per cent to 1,388 crore in the June quarter as against Rs 1,057 crore seen in the same quarter last year. A one-time generic order in the US ($50 million) and lower R&D spend also aided the numbers.
Past few years have been weak for the company majorly due to regulatory investigations and the pricing pressure in its key markets.
In the last one year, the stock has corrected about 46 per cent from its September 2018 high.
On the business front however things have improved for the company in recent quarters on the back of Halol plant clearance and meaningful contribution from its specialty businesses.
In the June quarter, the company’s US business that contributes around 36 per cent of overall sales, saw revenue going up by 12 per cent y-o-y in the June quarter, driven by a one-time business of generic supply to a customer and improvement in Taro’s (US subsidiary) sales. While the company’s overall generic business in the US have not seen any broad-based improvement, the ramp-up in the specialty business shows robust growth prospects in the medium term with the key drugs launches including Ilumya and Cequa. 
The total specialty business revenue for Sun Pharma in the first quarter across geographies was USD 94 million. While the higher R&D cost and delay in launch of Cequa can impact the margins of the company in the near term, the ramp-up in specialty revenue and fall in marketing costs are expected to drive significant margin expansion in the medium run.
Further, the US generics business is expected to improve with more quality approvals from the Halol plant. The company has guided for low to mid-teen growth in the US business in FY20. 
India & Emerging Markets
The company’s India formulation business, which accounted for approximately 28 per cent of our total sales, grew 8 per cent (y-o-y) during the quarter. The transition of domestic distribution business from Aditya Medisales to its own wholly-owned subsidiary moderated the revenue from the domestic market during the quarter. The company enjoys leadership position in the various chronic segments in the domestic market.
The company’s business growth in the emerging market was flat during the quarter due to volatile currencies. Its ‘Rest of the world’ segment grew 56 per cent y-o-y driven by higher sales and consolidation of Pola Pharma in Japan.
Sun Pharma’s operating margin for the first quarter stood at 23 per cent, improved by 807 bps sequentially due to lower R&D spend.
Risks
While earnings for Sun Pharma will be driven by growth in the specialty business and steady performance in India and the emerging markets, any adverse outcome in the ongoing investigation on drug price collusion by the US Department of Justice, escalation of SEBI investigation on the whistle-blower complaint and delay in specialty drugs approval may impact the performance of the company."

10,2019-08-18,Sun Pharma,"Accounting jugglery
Parvatha Vardhini C
What seemed a liquidity crunch in certain companies in the IL&FS group a year ago, has metamorphed into an accounting fraud and has had ripple effects across the NBFC sector since then. The saga began in June last year when IL&FS Transportation Networks (ITNL) delayed repayment of ₹450 crore of inter-corporate deposits from SIDBI.
In August 2018, IL&FS Financial Services (IFIN) defaulted on repaying its commercial-paper investors on the due date. As news of more delays/defaults came to light, rating agencies downgraded the group’s various borrowing programmes to junk status, affecting mutual funds, banks and insurance companies with exposure to the group and, ultimately, retail investors.
Over the last few years, companies such as IFIN had raised funds from the market and issued new debt to clients/group companies to help them service old debt. These entities were otherwise finding it difficult to do so due to such reasons as project cost-overruns. This process helped the group postpone provisioning for bad loans and/or recognition of NPAs, enabling them to show good profits.
But there came a point when things went out of control as asset-liability mismatches arose from using short-term borrowings to fund long-term infrastructure assets. When the crisis broke out in September 2018, the IL&FS group, comprising over 300 entities, stood on a consolidated debt of nearly ₹1 lakh crore — ₹99,354 crore to be precise. Its debt-to-equity ratio was 10:1 as of March 2018.
A probe ordered by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in public interest brought out a charge-sheet in end-May 2019. The Serious Frauds Investigation Office (SFIO), which conducted the probe, found that IFIN fraudulently lent to different companies belonging to a defaulting borrower (non-group entities) to help them repay their principal and/or interest, repeating the cycle several times.
Ultimately, the final loan was declared NPA or written off or is still outstanding, resulting in delayed recognition of NPAs, ballooning of debt and ultimately, losses to IFIN and its stakeholders.
Lending multiple times over was also carried on with group entities. In doing so, IFIN disregarded RBI norms for group lending to help the holding company (IL&FS), which had reached its lending limits.
Lending by IFIN to group companies stood at ₹5,200 crore or 37 per cent of total loans and advances for the year-ended March 2018. Besides, group entities such as ITNL were supported by lending through vendors and third-parties as well, who immediately transferred the funds to ITNL or ITNL SPVs.
Though these actions led to negative net-owned funds (NOF) and negative capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR) at IFIN, auditors did not raise the red flag. They also did not exercise due diligence in verifying end-use of funds and were found guilty of colluding with the management to conceal material information and falsifying books and financial statements from 2013-14 to 2017-18.
To resolve the crisis, the new board appointed after the NCLT order on this matter has embarked on asset monetisation and sale of investments across companies in the group.
Anand Kalyanaraman
On January 7, 2009, Ramalinga Raju, the Chairman of Satyam Computer Services, dropped a bombshell. He confessed that the company’s accounting books were fudged. The news sent shock waves. Satyam Computers was among India’s big four information technology companies. This was possibly the biggest scam in Indian corporate history, and was referred to as India’s ‘Enron’.
Surprisingly, the accounting tricks employed were fairly simple — inflate revenues and profits, overstate assets, understate liabilities. This made it all the more surprising as to how Satyam’s auditors (PwC) missed out on what was going on for years.
According to Raju’s statement, Satyam Computers’ September 2008 balance-sheet had inflated cash and bank balances of ₹5,040 crore, non-existent accrued interest of ₹376 crore, understated liability of ₹1,230 crore and overstated debtors position of ₹490 crore. All this added up to ₹7,136 crore.
The gap in the balance-sheet, Raju said, was due to inflated profits over many years. In the September 2008 quarter, for instance, revenue was shown as ₹2,700 crore as against the actual ₹2,112 crore, while operating profit was shown as ₹649 crore against the actual ₹61 crore. This resulted in cash and bank being inflated by ₹588 crore in the September 2008 quarter alone. The company’s operating margin for the quarter was just 3 per cent as against the reported 24 per cent.
This pattern of inflating sales and profits had been going on for many years. The need to keep up with the pretence of higher profits caused the company to invest more in resources and assets, which resulted in costs going up significantly.
The promoters feared that a poor financial performance would result in a take-over which would expose the hole in the books. So, the vicious cycle of falsification of accounts to cover up earlier falsifications continued. As Raju put it, “It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten.”
Giving effect to financial frauds involves many carefully co-ordinated sleights of hand at the operational level. So, there was excess billing through fake invoices; non-existent employees were shown as being on Satyam’s rolls, and fixed deposit receipts were forged to give credence to the purported bank balances.
If the auditors had done the basic audit check of confirming with the banks the balances held by Satyam, the fraud could perhaps have been sniffed out earlier. Failing to do this raised suspicions that the audit partners were negligent, at best, and complicit, at worst.
A fix on the extent of the scam was reached only after the accounts were redrawn. Tech Mahindra, which took over Satyam Computers in April 2009 for around ₹2,900 crore and renamed it Mahindra Satyam, presented the restated accounts in September 2010. As per these, the financial fraud was to the tune of ₹7,855 crore. This comprised around ₹6,243 crore till April 2008 and ₹1,612 crore since then. This was close to what Ramalinga Raju had indicated in January 2009.
The account restatement resulted in exceptional items which contributed to a massive loss of ₹8,177 crore in FY 2009 and a loss of ₹125 crore in FY 2010.
Satya Sontanam
Within years of the emergence of the Satyam scam that resulted in improved regulations in corporate reporting, disclosures and governance, a similar fraud from Ricoh India — an Indian arm of the Japanese multinational, Ricoh Global — came to light.
Ricoh India, too, escalated its revenue and pushed up profits and reserves by fudging accounting entries that were not supported by actual transactions, as per the forensic audit report of PwC. SEBI also pointed out large-scale irregularities in the company’s business transactions and manipulations in the books of accounts, amounting to fraud.
Eventually, the investors of Ricoh India were left in the lurch as trading was suspended and moved to Z category of the BSE — where settlement takes place on a trade-for-trade basis.
Later, the company, suo moto, filed for insolvency as it was unable to meet its liabilities.
The company did not get much investor attention till 2012-13, when it forayed from the business of retailing digital printers and the imaging equipment to cloud computing and other IT services.
Ricoh’s revenue grew multi-fold from ₹633 crore in FY13 to ₹1,638 crore by FY15, with losses (₹1.3 crore) turning into profits of ₹33.9 crore. This triggered a manic rally in the stock, which rose vertically from sub-₹100 in November 2013 to over ₹1,000 by June 2015. This resulted in the valuation soaring, aided by impressive order-books. Increase in debt was construed as a sign of growing business.
But what led to the sharp rise in revenue and profits, as per PwC report, was the booking of revenue before completion of the projects, and ‘channel stuffing’ — the company shipping more goods to the distributors and the retailers without commensurate demand from the end-users. Reports also stated that the company delivered products or services to non-existent customers.
Back-dated entries without supporting transactions also led to increase in the company’s profits and reserves. For instance, a single adjustment to the books of accounts of ₹67 crore (net) in the quarter-ended June 30, 2015 resulted in a loss of ₹64 crore being converted into a profit of ₹2.7 crore.
Suspicion about the company’s financial health arose when it delayed releasing results for the quarter-ended December 2015.
Subsequently, Ricoh, in April 2016, on the basis of the above-mentioned preliminary forensic audit findings, informed SEBI about the irregularities in the books of accounts.
A loss of ₹1,118 crore was disclosed for FY16 (against profit of ₹33 crore in FY15) due to reversal and write-off of provisions and unsupported book entries.
Accusations that the auditors, who gave true and fair view of the financial statements in the previous years, were privy to such irregularities cannot be ruled out.

At the outset, it must be said that this is not a case of accounting fraud. Sun Pharmaceuticals in 2017 sought approval from its shareholders to enter into related party transaction with Aditya Medisales (AML). The latter was controlled by the promoters of Sun Pharma. However, AML was dealing as a third-party distributor of Sun Pharma’s domestic drugs and formulations business for a long time.
How did Aditya Medisales remain hidden as a related party for so long then?
Multiple investment companies owned by the promoters of Sun Pharma controlled AML. However, the direct holding of the companies classified as Sun Pharma’s promoters was below the threshold that would have led to AML being classified as a related party.
When the company declared AML as a related party in 2017, the shareholders approved it in the annual general meeting. Sun Pharma declared AML as a related party in 2017 after the promoter group consolidated its holdings in AML, thereby crossing the threshold for being classified as a related party.
Sun Pharma conducted a conference call with investors to make it clear that the transactions with AML were at an arm’s length basis and that there were no wrongdoing in these dealings.
All of this came out in the open when a whistleblower complained to market regulator SEBI of funds being siphoned out of Sun Pharma by promoters from AML and another promoter-controlled entity Suraksha Realty.
SEBI had sent queries to Sun Pharma to understand the modus operandi of the operation of the third-party distributor. The progress on this action by SEBI is unclear. Sun Pharma said it had responded to the market regulator’s query about the whistleblower’s complaint.
Sun Pharma, on its part, moved swiftly to calm investors’ nerves. Dilip Shanghvi, promoter and managing director of Sun Pharma, said that shareholders weren’t at a disadvantage in the arrangement with AML. Bowing to shareholders’ anguish and pressure, Sun Pharma took over the distribution operations from AML and started distributing domestic drugs and formulations on its own.
It therefore pays to keep an eye on the various related-party transactions. Even if they are above board legally, investors must note that not all companies can be as swift as Sun Pharma to annul arrangements with related parties.
Lokeshwarri SK
The accounting fraud in Enron Corp towards the turn of this century, perhaps had the most widespread ramification with respect to the manner in which financial statements were reported, corporate governance practices as well as regulations.
Enron’s story is one of spectacular growth in the 1990s, as the natural gas pipeline operator decided to branch out into other areas such as natural gas trading and telecommunication and other geographies.
Lauded as the most innovative company in America by Fortune magazine for six consecutive years from 1995 to 2000, most Wall Street analysts were betting heavily on the Enron story in the 90s. But Enron’s diversification proved to be its undoing.
Its telecom venture — wherein, it invested large sums in online marketers and service providers, constructed a fibre optic communications network, and attempted to create a market for trading broadband communications capacity — was initiated towards the peak of the dotcom bubble, resulting in heavy debt on its books. When the bubble burst, these ventures turned non-profitable, while the debt remained on the books.
Enron’s investments in public utilities in India, South America, and the UK ran into trouble due to opposition from local political parties. Three, its energy trading business, while appearing to be making money, was actually boosted by creative accounting.
Despite many of its new ventures turning non-profitable, the company continued to present strong growth numbers by falsifying its accounts. This was done in numerous ways.
One, through the use of ‘mark-to-market’ accounting, for which the company received the SEC’s nod in 1992. This allowed the company to show estimated profits in many ventures against actual profits.
In July 2000, Enron entered into partnership with Blockbuster video rental chain.
This was a high-growth segment and Enron began recording expected earnings based on future growth, inflating its revenue greatly.
The high-speed broadband telecom network, in which millions of dollars were spent, also became non-profitable as the dotcom bubble burst.
The use of ‘special purpose entities’ to hide business losses and almost worthless assets was perfected by Enron. It is reported that Enron would build an asset such as a power plant and, immediately, recognise the projected profit on its books, even if the plant was not operational.
If the revenue from the plant fell short of projections, instead of taking the loss, the company would move the asset to SPEs, where the loss would be concealed.
Enron also disguised bank loans as energy derivative trades to conceal the extent of its indebtedness. Once all these creative accounting methods were revealed, Enron’s profits vanished and the stock price collapsed.
Shareholders, including thousands of Enron workers who held company stock in their 401(k) retirement accounts, lost billions of dollars.
The main outcome of the Enron scandal was the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which brought about changes to securities law in the US and led to other countries adopting them. Auditors came under greater scrutiny in the US with the SOX Act creating a Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, operating under the SEC, to regulate independent auditors of publicly-traded companies. It prohibited auditors from providing certain consulting services to their audit clients and made pre-approval by the company’s board for other non-audit services necessary."

b) Profit after-tax rose 27.1 per cent to ₹2,665 crores in FY19 against ₹2,096 crore in FY18.
c) The company’s revenues from the US markets grew 22 per cent to ₹10,671 crore in FY19 driven by an increase in generic sales, incremental contribution from specialty product launches and a favourable foreign exchange rate. This is despite the price erosion witnessed in the US markets, driven by a higher bargaining power of customers and a faster pace of generic approvals from the USFDA.
d) In the Indian market, Sun Pharma continues to be the undisputed industry leader, enjoying 8.2 per cent share of the market. This is despite its revenue from the Indian branded generic business declining by 8.5 per cent to ₹7,348 crore in FY19.
Outlook and valuation: The global phar industry is at crossroads with increasing pressure from the governments and regulators over escalating drug prices. The industry, in general, has bottomed out led by Sun Pharma which is currently trading at levels which are 40 per cent off its 52-week high. The company is focussing on exports and R&D as it has become imperative to innovate in order to survive for the long-term in the pharma business."
8,2019-09-06,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma ordered to undergo a forensic audit by SEBI
 Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd said that it is undergoing a forensic audit of its financial statements as ordered by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
SEBI has asked for a forensic audit of the company’s financial statements for three fiscal years to March 2018, the drugmaker told exchanges in a late evening filing on Thursday, without specifying the reason. The shares fell 3 per cent to Rs 439.35 at 9:23 AM in Mumbai.
The latest probe points to mounting challenges for the billionaire Dilip Shanghvi-controlled drugmaker after whistle-blower complaints on corporate governance lapses triggered a stock slide last year and forced the firm to tweak some of its business contracts to contain the crisis. 
The latest regulatory action was disclosed after a query by exchanges asking the company to confirm local news reports that Sun Pharma had been asked to conduct the forensic audit following the complaints.
“Sentimentally things will remain negative at the present juncture,” said Surya Patra, vice president at Phillipcapital India Pvt in Mumbai. “What is not known is the outcome of the investigation, and if there will be some action taken by SEBI. The basis of the forensic audit is also not known.”
Sun Pharma had swung into action early this year to quell a crisis of confidence, triggered by the whistle-blower complaints alleging that its founder Shanghvi was wringing extra financial benefits from the company’s operations through related party transactions. Shanghvi had denied wrongdoing in a December conference call.
“The company is committed to adhering to all applicable legal and statutory requirements,” it said in the filing on Thursday."

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries has launched ophthalmic specialty Novel/NDA drug Cequa (API: cyclosporine; strength: 0.09 per cent solution; US FDA approval: Aug’18; patent expiry: August 2033) in the US. This is the third such product from Sun Pharma’s ophthalmic portfolio (Xelpros and Bromsite) and 9th specialty product in the US. Cequa is the first and only US FDA approved cyclosporine treatment delivered with NCELL (nanomicellar) technology, is indicated for keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye disease; 16mn+ patients in the US). Cequa offers advantages i.e. increased bioavailability, improved ocular tissue penetration, superior tolerability and higher concentration (0.09 per cent vs. available 0.05 per cent). We expect Sun Pharma to generate about $5 million /$20 million revenue in FY20/FY21E (already built in our valuation model) with peak sales of $40-50 million.
Though Sun Pharma has already addressed some corporate governance issues raised by the investors, the SEBI-related issues continue to remain event-specific risk for the stock in the near-term. At CMP, stock trades at about 19.2x and 15.8x of FY20 and FY21 earnings, respectively (12-month fwd 3-yearr average Bloomberg PE at about27x; below 1-SD three-year average), which is attractive to take fresh position, in our view.

The promoters of Sun Pharmaceuticals increased their stake in the company marginally during the July-September quarter to 54.55 per cent from 54.38 per cent at the end of June. They bought 39 lakh shares worth about ₹400 crore from the open market during the quarter.
The promoters have also reduced the number of shares pledged with financial institutions. In a shareholding pattern disclosure to the exchanges, the pharma major revealed that the pledged quantity has dipped to 13.62 lakh shares (10.41 per cent of their holding) from 14.31 per cent (10.97 per cent).
The stock was hovering between ₹450 and ₹366 during the quarter but closed flat at around ₹390.
However, foreign portfolio investors (FPI) have reduced their holding in Sun Pharma to 14.7 per cent from 14.93 per cent, whereas insurance companies 7.93 per cent (6.79 per cent) and small retail investors 6.32 per cent (6.30 per cent) have increased their holding. Among the insurance companies, LIC’s holding has remained static at 5.88 per cent.
Stock turns bitter
The stock has been one of the big losers at the market as issues such as US FDA observations and whistleblower accusations of insider trading by Sun Pharma promoter Dilip Shanghvi and his brother-in-law Sudhir Valia kept it constantly under bear control.

Though the Sun Pharma stock has given a return of 207 per cent over 10 years, it crashed 50 per cent in the last five-year period and 33.15 per cent in the last year alone.
With the promoters buying the stock, is it time to take a relook at the stock? Well, analysts have a mixed view.
According to Reliance Securities, though Sun Pharma has already addressed some corporate governance issues raised by the investors, SEBI-related issues continue to remain an event-specific risk for the stock in the near term. ""However, at CMP, stock trades at 19.2x and 15.8x of FY20 and FY21 earnings, respectively (12-month forward 3-year average. Bloomberg PE at nearly 27x; below 1-SD three-year average), which is attractive to take fresh position, in our view,"" it added with a buy recommendation and price target of ₹500.
However, Credit Suisse, remains neutral, with a target price of ₹450. It is cautious on the company due to a forensic audit being carried out on its financials from FY16-18 and litigation on Ranbaxy products.
In a preview report on the July-September quarter, Prabhudas Lilladher said it expects tepid US sales growth and moderate India formulations to keep sales growth (Q-o-Q) and EBITDA flat. The domestic broking firm has maintained its 'reduced’ rating on the stock with a price target of ₹396.
Emkay Global, in a preview report, said Sun Pharma benefited from lower R&D spends in Q1 and seasonality in direct-to-consumer advertising costs, which will scale up in Q2
and thus, lead to a decline in margins. Further, the US business should see a sharp fall q-o-q as the one-time generic supply order in the US has receded."

0,﻿2019-11-20,Sun Pharma,"Is Taro buyback news triggering rally in Sun Pharma? 
Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries jumped over 8 per cent on Wednesday at ₹460.60 on the NSE, on the back of Taro's buyback news. The stock closed at ₹448.5 on the NSE, a gain of 5.62 per cent, over the previous day’s close. Trading volumes to jumped to 2.31 crore shares.
According to analysts, the main trigger for the rally is the current buyback offer from Taro Pharmaceutical Industries, which could lift Sun Pharma’s holding in the company. Currently, Sun Pharma holds 76.5 per cent stake in the company.
Taro Pharmaceutical Industries on November 14 launched its modified Dutch auction tender offer to repurchase up to $225 million in value of its ordinary shares at a price not greater than $92 a share or less than $80/share. The offer will expire on December 16. If the offer is fully subscribed, the number of shares to be purchased in the offer represents approximately 6.3-7.3 per cent of Taro’s currently issued and outstanding shares depending on the purchase price payable for those shares pursuant to the offer, Taro said in the offer document.
On buyback, Uday Baldota, Director and Chief Executive Officer, Taro, told investors: “We constantly evaluate various alternatives to obtain this result, which include acquisitions, special dividends or share buybacks, all of which are benefits and consideration.”
With regard to inorganic opportunities, Taro is keen and continues to evaluate such opportunities that have a strategic fit and are financially justifiable.
“Based upon our strong balance sheet and operating cash flows as well as a cautiously optimistic view of our short- and long-term strategy, we believe the benefits of a share buyback provides the best benefits and most value to our shareholders, especially, by providing liquidity to the current shareholders,” he added.
According to marketmen, the offer might have received a strong response, though one has to wait for official confirmation. If it gets overwhelming response, then the move could help Sun Pharma as it will make Taro’s cash fungible. Besides, its voting power will also increase substantially in the Israel-based firm. However, analysts cautioned investors as the stock is generally volatile in nature and any negative news could trigger a sharp fall in the stock, especially when the company is facing a forensic audit for its FY16-18 financials and litigation on Ranbaxy products.
In a recent research report (post Q2 results), Emkay Global said: “We do not foresee any meaningful margin expansion until the specialty portfolio picks up meaningfully. We expect the stock to be range-bound as the market will keenly follow data points on specialty products.” The domestic broking house maintained its ‘hold’ rating with a revised target price of ₹490 from earlier ₹465. While corporate governance concerns are largely behind, Sun Pharma’s US specialty business still has a long road to profitability, it added.
“In light of increasing business visibility in India and other geographies, we maintain our ‘buy’ recommendation on the stock with a target price of ₹500,” said Reliance Securities said."
