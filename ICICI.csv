204,2018-04-03,ICICI,"Disclose majority shareholder’s real identity: Whistleblower Gupta to NuPower 
NuPower Renewables — the company founded by ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar — must disclose the real identity of its majority shareholder DH Renewables Holding Ltd of Mauritius, whistle-blower Arvind Gupta has demanded, alleging masked share transfers.
Videocon Group Chairman Venugopal Dhoot is said to have invested in NuPower Renewables and extended a ₹64-crore loan after Videocon secured a loan from a consortium of banks that included ICICI Bank.
Gupta, who identifies himself as an informed and vigilant investor owning shares both in ICICI Bank and Videocon Industries, alleged that NuPower Renewables was a 50:50 joint venture of Deepak Virendra Kochhar and Dhoots when founded in 2008.
Subsequently, “masked” share transfers were done to a trust called Pinnacle Energy, whose trustee is Deepak Kochhar, after Chanda Kochhar became the Managing Director and CEO of ICICI Bank in May 2009.
Gupta said the data he has gathered from the Registrar of Companies shows that Mauritius-based DH Renewables Holding is now the majority shareholder of NuPower with 54.99 per cent interest. Around 33.17 per cent is held by Pinnacle Energy, whose managing trustee is Deepak.
Pulls out of event
Facing allegations of wrongdoing in the loan extended to Videocon Group, ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar has pulled out of the annual session of FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO), where she was to be felicitated by President Ram Nath Kovind, according to the organiser. Kochhar was to be the Guest of Honour at the April 5 event and flyers sent out last month mentioned her name prominently. However, the revised ones did not carry her name."

 I-T Department has issued notice to Deepak Kochhar, husband of ICICI bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar, in connection with its tax evasion probe in the Videocon bank loan case, officials said. 
The notice had been issued to Deepak Kochhar under Section 131 of the I-T Act and he has been asked to furnish details of his personal finances, I-T Returns for the last few years and business transactions with NuPower Renewables.
 He has been asked, they said, to furnish details of his personal finances, Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the last few years and business transactions with the firm apart from other financial details of the company.
 The department has also sent a detailed questionnaire, seeking details of the firm’s operations, to be answered by him.
 The tax department has launched a probe into the finances of the company and those associated with it, the officials said.
 Few more notices have been sent to the people associated with the firm and based on their replies, further action will be taken, they said.
 In a related development, the CBI officials said that Deepak Kochhar, who has been named in a preliminary enquiry, will be called for questioning soon.
 The CBI had questioned a few ICICI bank officials as part of a preliminary enquiry to find out if any quid pro quo was involved in the bank issuing a Rs 3,250 crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2012.
 The loan had recently made news after reports questioned it and linked it to a possible quid pro quo that Videocon group promoter Venugopal Dhoot allegedly had with NuPower Renewables, a company founded by Deepak Kochchar.
 The CBI enquiry had named Dhoot, Deepak Kochhar and unidentified others, officials said."

Rajiv Kochhar, the brother-in-law of ICICI Bank MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar, was detained by immigration authorities at Mumbai airport when he was to leave for a Southeast Asian country and handed over to CBI sleuths, who questioned him in connection with the bank’s dealing with Videocon Group.
Kochhar was stopped from leaving the country at the Mumbai international airport by the authorities as the CBI had issued a Lookout Circular (LoC) against him, officials said.
He was handed over to a CBI team which is questioning him in connection with the case, they said.
Preliminary enquiry
The CBI has already questioned a few ICICI Bank officials as part of a preliminary enquiry to find if any quid pro quo was involved in the bank issuing a Rs 3,250-crore loan to Videocon Group in 2012.
Agency officials said they are also studying relevant documents of the transaction and if they come across any evidence that indicates wrongdoing, ICICI Bank managing director and chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar along with others could be summoned for detailed questioning.
They said the statements of nodal officers of ICICI Bank, who were part of processing the loan of about Rs 3,250 crore, have been recorded as part of the preliminary enquiry or PE registered six weeks ago.
The PE has named Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot, Deepak Kochhar and unidentified others, they said.
A PE is a precursor before the agency lodges an FIR to probe criminal charges on the basis of evidence collected during the former exercise."

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday is understood to have issued look-out notices at all major airports for ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar, and Videocon Group Chairman Venugopal Dhoot. Deepak Kochhar is the promoter of NuPower Renewables.
“This is misleading news,” Venugopal Dhoot told BusinessLine, when asked about the notice. He also declined to comment on the investigation over alleged irregularities in the grant of the loan.
On Thursday, the CBI had detained Chanda Kochhar’s brother-in-law Rajiv Kochhar, who is the Founder and CEO of Avista Advisory, to question him on possible links to ICICI Bank sanctioning a ₹3,250-crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2012.
The CBI continued its questioning of Rajiv Kochhar on Friday. He was let off in the evening, but may be summoned again next week, sources said.
The agency is also expected to summon some officials of ICICI Bank and the Videocon Group next week.
Rajiv Kochhar’s Avista Advisory is a financial services company with offices in Singapore and Mumbai. After the CBI issued a look-out notice for him, Kochhar was detained at the Mumbai airport on Thursday, just as he was about to leave for a South-East Asian country.
It is learnt that the CBI has already registered a preliminary probe naming Dhoot, Deepak Kochhar and unidentified others in connection with the loan.
Meanwhile, ICICI Bank on Friday said that its Board of Directors will meet on May 7. In a disclosure to the Bombay Stock Exchange, the bank said its Board will “consider the approval of the audited annual accounts for the financial year ended March 31, 2018.”

199,2018-04-09,ICICI,"Allegations against ICICI Bank pose reputational risks: Fitch
 
An investigation into allegations that ICICI Bank has extended a loan with a potential conflict of interest raises questions over the bank's governance and creates reputational risks, according to Fitch Ratings. Other regulatory sanctions are also possible, depending on the outcome of the investigation, it added.
The global credit rating agency observed that the investigation could also undermine investor confidence in the bank, with potential implications for funding costs and liquidity in an extreme scenario, although its status as a systemically important bank implies it will benefit from some form of state support.
Fitch underscored that there is a potential risk of financial penalties as well as legal action if the investigation comes up with findings against the bank. “The allegation relates to a $500-million loan to Videocon Group, whose controlling shareholder co-founded a separate company with the spouse of ICICI's CEO. A significant portion of the loan has since become non-performing,” Fitch said.
ICICI's board has denied any wrongdoing, highlighting that the loan was underwritten in accordance with the bank's credit standards and was extended as part of a consortium involving over 20 banks. The bank has stressed that it has not given any credit to the borrower group outside of the consortium.
“Nevertheless, the presence of the bank's CEO on this credit committee - and the bank's reluctance to support an independent probe - have, in our opinion, created doubts over the strength of its corporate governance practices,” elaborated Fitch. The allegations come against a backdrop of high non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking sector, some of which have been linked to fraudulent lending.
Fitch believes corporate governance at private banks such as ICICI is generally stronger than at state-owned banks due to better-qualified board members and more professional management. “Moreover, compensation structures at private banks are more performance-oriented, while a large and diversified investor base encourages greater management accountability. These assumptions could come under question if the investigations expose misconduct at ICICI,” said the agency.
Fitch said it will closely monitor developments, and would take appropriate rating action if risks to the banks' reputation and financial profile were to rise considerably. “That said, the banks' rating is underpinned by relatively strong capitalisation and profitability. Core capitalisation was 14.2 per cent in December 2017, among the highest in the sector.
“Losses on the loan in question would be unlikely to significantly undermine ICICI's financial profile - in particular, its core capitalisation would remain strong even if the loan were completely written off,” said the agency.
The CBI on Monday continued grilling ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar’s brother-in-law Rajiv Kochhar for the fifth straight day."
196,2018-04-10,ICICI,"Under Chanda Kochhar’s watch, ICICI Bank shares lagged Nifty
Chanda Kochhar took over as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of ICICI Bank in May 2009. Since then, the bank’s performance on key parameters of deposits, advances, net interest income and adjusted net profit have been steady and have grown in the range of 13.5-15 per cent (compounded annual growth rate between FY10-FY17), according to standalone data provided by Capitaline.
But the growth in the bank’s share price at 7 per cent (CAGR in FY10-FY18) has lagged Nifty’s 10 per cent and Bank Nifty’s 14.4 per cent. This is because its non-performing assets (NPAs) jumped substantially, with gross and net NPAs rising at CAGR of 24 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively. These rates have slowed down to 22 per cent and 20 per cent year-on-year in the nine months ended December 2017. Even in terms of percentage, gross and net NPAs have been maintained at 7.8 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively.
 








 
 
Stable NII
However, the high corporate exposure of the past continues to haunt the bank’s financial performance. While growth in deposits and advances y-o-y in the nine months ended December 2017 has slipped to 10-11 per cent, rise in net interest income came off to 8 per cent and adjusted net profit declined 26 per cent (also due to lower other income).
Nevertheless, the bank’s current and savings deposit ratio (CASA) and net interest margin were maintained at about 50 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, as on December 31. Good performance on these two key profitability factors is encouraging as they are at least almost the same as March 31, 2017 levels. So net-net, the bank’s financial performance is ‘slowly’ coming back on track.
Analysts turn cautious
The company is expected to announce its March 2018 quarter results on May 7. Given the concerns surrounding lending to Videocon and future outlook on NPAs, analysts expect the stock, which is off 21 per cent from the 52-week or all-time high level hit on January 29, to remain under pressure. Sharekhan revised its rating on the stock to ‘Hold’ given the uncertainties.
Fitch Ratings has highlighted concerns, such as the question over the bank’s governance and reputational risks. “There is a potential risk of financial penalties, as well as legal action, if the investigation comes up with findings against the bank,” it said. However it has negated its own view by adding that the bank has relatively strong capitalisation and profitability. “Losses on the loan in question would be unlikely to significantly undermine ICICI’s financial profile - in particular, its core capitalisation would remain strong even if the loan were completely written off,” it pointed out. However, Jeferries recommends to buy the stock, while IDFC Securities has rated it an outperformer."

Pressure seems to be mounting on ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar to step down. While the bank’s board has previously come out in support of Kochhar, the issue could be taken up at its next meeting.
Institutional investors are already understood to be raising concerns over the alleged irregularities in the bank’s ₹3,250-crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2012.
On Monday, the private sector lender continued to face the heat as global rating agency Fitch said allegations over the loan to Videocon raise questions of corporate governance and pose reputational risks for the bank.
“Fitch will closely monitor developments, and would take appropriate rating action if risks to the bank’s reputation and financial profile were to rise considerably,” it said in a statement.
“That said, the bank’s rating is underpinned by relatively strong capitalisation and profitability,” it added.
The Finance Ministry is understood to be keeping close tabs on the issue but has decided to take a hands-off approach for now. “Investigative agencies are already probing the allegations. The government is being fully apprised of the matter on a daily basis,” said a source, adding that if required, it would take a proactive role. The government nominee on the board of ICICI Bank is Lok Ranjan, Joint Secretary in the Department of Financial Services. LIC Chairman VK Sharma is also on the board.
Meanwhile, the CBI questioned Kochhar’s brother-in-law Rajiv Kochhar for the fifth straight day. “He was questioned on more details relating to the loan,” said a source, adding that he is likely to be summoned again on Tuesday.
The CBI is expected to widen its investigation and question more officials from NuPower Renewables, which was founded by Deepak Kochhar, husband of the ICICI Bank chief.

All gloom Dark clouds over Kochhar’s career PTI
   -  PTI


Nemesis for many celebrities comes through their offspring. A prodigal son or daughter can often, through their actions, demolish the carefully earned reputation of a lifetime. Sometimes that happens through a spouse. As in the case of Chanda Kochhar, Managing Director and CEO, ICICI Bank, who is in the eye of a storm, over a conflict of interest issue. 
Her husband Deepak Kochhar and some family members had a joint venture with Venugopal Dhoot of the Videocon group. The allegation against her is that ICICI Bank provided loans to the Videocon group (later declared NPA) even as there seemed to be a ‘sweetheart’ deal by which the Videocon group through its various arms invested in the joint venture of her husband.
For the past decade that she has been at the helm of ICICI Bank and even in the decade preceding it, she hardly ever put a foot wrong. She was the banking sector’s first telegenic star and as a woman making it to the top, was always seen as a role model for those striving to climb the corporate ladder. 
She often topped various surveys of the most powerful women in business or among the most admired bankers in the country. Shoot any question at her — whether on the credit crisis, interest rates, NPA issues, policy paralysis, slowdown or pick-up — and she would always produce the perfect quote.
 There would be no hemming and hawing. It would always be precise, neutral and politically correct. It could be frustrating for those trying to read too much meaning into those statements, but you couldn’t quarrel with them. As a strategy to be on the right side of the powers that be and not let her views affect the organisation in any way, it was flawless.
A question of propriety?
Now, for the first time, she has her back to the wall. And her silence is as surprising as it is eloquent. Yes, the board of directors has come to her support. Their defence is on these lines — there was no conflict of interest as Videocon was not an investor in NuPower, the joint venture; that the credit committee had many independent directors; that the loan was part of a consortium; and that she made disclosures as required under various laws. 
The arguments are cleverly worded but this is an issue that was never only about legality. It was about ethics. Propriety demanded that she should have disclosed to the board her ‘interest’ in the Videocon loan on the grounds that her husband had a business dealing with the group. 
Second, the highest standards of corporate governance demand that she should have recused herself from the discussion at the board and voting on the deal. 
To merely say that the board committee sanctioning the loan was chaired by someone else or that the committee had many independent directors doesn’t let her off the hook. A proposal worth ₹3,250 crore doesn’t get passed at the board level in any bank without it being backed or pushed by top officials. 
What next?
There is no easy way of saying it — but the way out of this whole mess is for her to resign. Perhaps the Board may have to suggest it to her informally and provide her an honourable exit. Place on record her considerable contributions towards building the organisation. But accept her resignation — with of course the deepest regret. The current climate of public resentment as well as intolerance for grey zones with regard to bad loans may demand nothing less. 
The damage to her as well as the bank’s reputation is colossal. Her moral standing and ability to demand total integrity from her staff and her effectiveness as a leader stands weakened. And the damage goes beyond just affecting the morale of the bank staff. What about those who looked up to her as a role model and aspired to reach the top? Think of the setback to those who have been arguing for privatisation of public sector banks on the grounds that they are cesspools of corruption and inefficiency. 
If this can happen in India’s top private sector bank, then how can we accuse public sector banks of crony capitalism? It might be entirely presumptuous to say it, but her seat at the high tables of various government and industry forums, as a trusted and valued voice of advice to finance ministers and RBI Governors, will now be shaky.
Chanda Kochhar was given the The Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship last year — an award that is given to executives who demonstrate a commitment to the common good that goes beyond the bottom line. Perhaps she will have to demonstrate that commitment to common good once more by leaving the scene. It is time for a new leadership to take over at the ICICI Bank."

If the Finance Ministry has its way, Chanda Kochhar is likely to continue as the CEO and Managing Director of ICICI Bank for now as the Ministry is against any immediate change.
According to sources, the Finance Ministry is not keen to get involved in the issue or support the call for a replacement for Kochhar. The RBI, too, has remained silent on the issue.
“There is no pressing need for a new CEO as of now. It is felt that this would add to the instability at the bank,” said the source, indicating that a knee-jerk reaction would not help as the banking sector is already under a lot of stress. The government is represented on the ICICI Bank board by Lok Ranjan, Joint Secretary in the Department of Financial Services. VK Sharma, Chairman of state owned Life Insurance Corporation, is also on the Board of the Bank.
Another source indicated that the investigation is still on and it may be too early to talk about a replacement. “It is for the RBI to first examine the whole issue before a concrete decision can be taken,” he said.
Institutional investors have raised concerns over the recent turn of events and about Kochhar continuing in her position. There is also a talk of an interim CEO.
Though a meeting of the board of directors of the bank is not in the offing this month, it cannot be ruled out. “Depending on the situation, a meeting could be called in the next few weeks,” said the first source.
Kochhar has been under siege over allegations of a conflict of interest in a ₹3,250-crore loan extended by ICICI Bank to the Videocon Group in 2012.
Her brother-in-law Rajiv Kochhar, founder and CEO of Avista Advisory, has been questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation while her husband Deepak Kochhar, who is the founder and CEO of NuPower Renewables, is also under the scanner."

Global rating agency S&P on Thursday said that recent issues at private sector lenders ICICI Bank and Axis Bank highlight issues of risk management and governance. 
“The recent governance issues in India's banking sector reiterate the need for banks to improve risk management and maintain strong governance processes, practices and systems,” it said in a release. 
Earlier, Fitch had also raised concerns over allegations at ICICI Bank and had said it raises reputational risks. 
S&P global ratings credit analyst Michael Puking said the “tone at the top” is crucial.

S&P further said it views the governance and transparency in Indian banking as a negative factor."
193,2018-04-17,ICICI,"Crisil reaffirms rating on ICICI Bank at ‘AAA/Stable’
 
Credit rating agency Crisil has reaffirmed its ratings on ICICI Bank’s debt instruments – Upper Tier-II Bonds aggregating ₹8,495 crore, Tier-I Perpetual Bonds aggregating ₹518 crore, and Bonds/Debentures aggregating ₹629 crore – at ‘AAA/Stable’.
Instruments with ‘AAA’ rating are considered to have the highest degree of safety regarding timely servicing of financial obligations. Such instruments carry the lowest credit risk.
While re-affirming the ratings, the agency said it has taken note of ICICI Bank board’s response to the recent allegations of potential conflict of interest pertaining to the bank’s exposure to Videocon Group.
Crisil believes that this exposure, which has already been classified as a non-performing asset (NPA) with sizeable provisioning by the bank, is in itself not material in the context of its outstanding loan book or capital. Any further provisioning, or even write-offs pertaining to that exposure, are not likely to impact the bank’s credit risk profile, it added.
The agency anticipates continuation in ICICI Bank’s strategy of building upon its strong market position in the Indian wholesale and retail lending markets, while maintaining its healthy capitalisation levels and strong liability franchise even as it strives to improve its asset quality.
Crisil said it will also monitor developments pertaining to the ongoing investigations on the bank’s exposure to the Videocon Group to watch out for any potential materiality in outcomes on areas like management stability or fund-raising ability and suitably factor them in its rating.
“The ratings on ICICI Bank’s debt instruments continue to reflect the bank’s healthy capitalisation, strong market position and comfortable resource profile. These strengths are tempered somewhat by the pressure on the bank’s asset quality from exposures to highly-leveraged corporate groups,” the agency said.
However, the bank’s healthy capital position, coupled with its demonstrated ability to raise capital and steady pre-provisioning profits, cushions the bank’s credit risk profile against asset quality risks.
Meanwhile, the asset quality performance of the bank’s retail asset portfolio that constitutes almost half of the bank’s advances mix as on December 31, 2017, is expected to remain stable over the medium term."
192,2018-04-19,ICICI,"ICICI Bank working on a succession plan 
ICICI Bank’s board is looking at the option of reviving the positions of Joint Managing Director / Deputy Managing Director, who could step into the shoes of the Managing Director & CEO as and when a vacancy arises.
“The private sector bank’s board may be working on a succession plan to ensure the smooth handover of reins at the top as and when the need arises,” industry sources told BusinessLine.
Controversies
This comes in the wake of the recent controversy surrounding the alleged financial dealings between Deepak Kochhar-promoted NuPower Renewables, the Videocon Group and Rajiv Kochhar-promoted Avista Advisory. Deepak Kochhar is the spouse of ICICI Bank’s MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar, while Rajiv is Deepak’s brother. While this has led to a clamour for Chanda Kochhar’s resignation, the bank’s board is considering a plan to strengthen the organisation by restoring the top-tier structure, whereby besides the MD & CEO, there is a Joint MD and Deputy Managing Director.
Earlier, ICICI Bank had a Joint MD. Chanda Kochhar held the position before being elevated to her current role in 2009.
Questions around a succession plan at ICICI Bank have been doing the rounds for the last few weeks, but sources stress that there is no immediate plan to replace Chanda Kochhar. However, some of the investors and board directors have informally have had discussions over the issue.
“As of now, there is no immediate plan to appoint a new or interim MD and CEO. There have been some conversations on the issue but not on a formal basis,” said a person familiar with the development.
The bigger question has been about who will succeed Kochhar when the need arises. Among the contenders for the top slot from within the bank could be Executive Directors NS Kannan, Vishakha Mulye, Vijay Chandok and Anup Bagchi. Among the EDs, Kannan is the senior-most. He was elevated to the board in May 2009. The tenure of the incumbent MD & CEO is up to March-end 2019.
However, the possibility of Sandeep Bakhshi, MD & CEO, ICICI Prudential Life, also exists, as he earlier served the bank as Deputy Managing Director and Head of Retail.
Sources also point out that outsiders, who were earlier with ICICI Bank, could also be considered for the top position. They include Rajiv Sabharwal, MD & CEO, Tata Capital; and Zarin Daruwala, CEO, Standard Chartered Bank. Till now, the board has backed Kochhar and has reposed full faith in her.
However, sources said the May 7 meeting of the bank’s board to discuss the annual results is likely to see a lot of debate on the allegations.
MK Sharma, the Non-Executive Chairman of ICICI Bank, on Wednesday met mutual fund houses to discuss the recent troubles at the private sector lender and investigations into the ₹3,250-crore loan to the Videocon Group.
The discussions are understood to have also centred around a possible succession plan. On Thursday, stock exchanges also sought a clarification from ICICI Bank on the reported meeting."

The Securities and Exchange Board of India plans to get a forensic examination done on the financial statements and disclosures made by ICICI Bank in the last few years amid a controversy over alleged conflict of interest involving the lender’s CEO Chanda Kochhar and her husband.
According to top officials, the capital markets regulator will also consult the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the issue to avoid any intra-regulatory jurisdiction issues.
The forensic examination will focus on various disclosures made by the top private sector bank over the last few years, vis-a-vis the clarifications submitted by ICICI Bank to the stock exchanges in reply to queries made in the backdrop of a controversy regarding certain loans extended as part of a consortium to Videocon.
Officials said the examination will also cover the disclosures made at the time of Kochhar being appointed as CEO and Managing Director of the bank for the first time in 2009. If required, SEBI will also seek details from the bank regarding various business dealings involving its top officials, including Kochhar, to look into alleged conflict of interest.
SEBI has been looking into the matter for any possible disclosure and corporate governance-related lapses at ICICI Bank, but has not come across any concrete proof so far, the officials said.
A probe by RBI in 2016 also did not find any ‘quid pro quo’ vis-a-vis ICICI Bank with regard to the loan extended to Videocon by the consortium which had the private sector lender as ‘a small member’, they added.
ICICI Bank landed in the controversy following allegations of a Rs 3,250-crore loan to Videocon Group, whose Chairman Venugopal Dhoot has been accused of having business dealings with NuPower Renewables, operated by Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar.
Besides, questions have been raised about Avista Advisory, run by Chanda’s brother-in-law Rajiv Kochhar, having advised some clients of ICICI Bank. The bank however has denied all these allegations and its board has strongly defended the chief executive saying it has full faith and confidence in Kochhar.
Since RBI had already looked into the matter in 2016 and found no wrongdoing, the bank and its board members have been exuding confidence that the company would get out of the controversy unscathed.
Kochhar has been known as one of the biggest driving forces behind the phenomenal growth of ICICI Bank, especially of its retail banking operations which got redefined following the entry of this private sector lender in the Indian banking space.
Subsequently, she has played a key role in expanding the bank’s business in other areas and its diversification, including the digital push in recent years."

NCLT has appointed Amit Gupta (Amit H Gupta & Co Chartered Accountants) as interim resolution professional to carry out the process as mentioned in the IBC


 The Mumbai Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal has admitted ICICI Bank’s plea to initiate corporate insolvency resolution process against Unimark Remedies Ltd to recover an outstanding loan of about Rs 149 crore.
Corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) is the process of resolution of insolvency of a corporate debtor (other than a financial service provider) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Once admitted, CIRP will commence on the date of admission (insolvency commencement date) and has to be completed within 180 days from this date.
ICICI Bank has sought CIRP against Unimark Remedies Ltd (corporate debtor) on the ground that it had committed default from December 31, 2015 onwards in repayment of various facilities granted to it to the extent of about Rs 149 crore. This is as per the proof of debt and default submitted by the bank to NCLT.
The facilities sanctioned to the Mumbai-headquartered healthcare company by the bank amounted to about Rs 132 crore (principal sanctioned amount) and the outstanding as at January-end 2018 amounted to about Rs 149 crore.
NCLT has appointed Amit Gupta (Amit H Gupta & Co Chartered Accountants) as interim resolution professional (IRP) to carry out the process as mentioned in the IBC. The estimated date of closure of CIRP is September-end 2018.
Under IBC, the IRP will manage the operations of the corporate debtor as a going concern. He will take control of assets of the corporate debtor. 
These assets do not include assets owned by a third party but in possession of the corporate debtor held under trust or under contractual arrangements, including bailment, assets of any Indian or foreign subsidiary of the corporate debtor, and assets as may be notified by the Central Government.
Unimark Remedies is a vertically integrated healthcare company with a business portfolio that includes products ranging from diagnostics, devices, finished formulations, cosmeceuticals, animal healthcare products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. It has manufacturing plants at Ahmedabad, Vapi (both in Gujarat), and Khopoli (Maharashtra).
ICICI Bank had reportedly tried to sell its loan exposure to asset reconstruction companies but could not make any headway."

188,2018-05-06,ICICI,"'ICICI Bank board to meet tomorrow; CEO loan issue may come up'
 The board of ICICI Bank, which will meet tomorrow for approving the annual earnings of 2017-18, may see some discussion on the allegations of conflict of interest against the lender’s CEO Chanda Kochhar, sources said.
 There are series of allegations of impropriety in ICICI Bank extending loans to some companies and enjoying reciprocal benefits. It is alleged that family members Kochhar, including her husband Deepak Kochhar, got financial favours from the borrowers against the loans sanctioned by the bank. The issue is being investigated by multiple agencies including CBI, Income Tax Department.
 Amid controversy of alleged conflict of interest involving ICICI Bank and its CEO, former SEBI chief M Damodaran has said one option is for her to step down for a period of three or four months till the investigation is completed.
 Although the board meeting agenda is limited to financial results, some board members may raise the issue of corporate governance, sources said, adding that it is up to the Chairman MK Sharma to allow deviation from the scheduled agenda.
The board has seven independent directors including chairman and government nominee director. The issue of compromise of corporate governance came to the fore when investor and whistleblower Arvind Gupta racked up the issue in the March. He alleged quid pro quo between Videocon Group and ICICI Bank’s chief executive officer (CEO) as well as her family members with respect to extending a loan worth ₹3,250 crore.
 It was alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar.
 There are also allegations that NuPower got investments of ₹325 crore from Mauritius-based Firstland Holdings, a company owned by Nishant Kanodia, son-in-law of Essar Group co-founder Ravi Ruia. The investments from Ruia’s son-in-law’s firm into NuPower started in December 2010. 
Incidentally, the same month ICICI Bank was lead banker in a consortium of Indian banks that extended a USD 530 million loan to Essar Steel Minnesota LLC on December 29, 2010. This loan was later classified as NPA. The Reserve Bank in its 2016 investigation in the matter had raised questions over the ownership of the Mauritius-based entity, First Land Holding, which had invested ₹325 crore in NuPower.
 Also, there was no clarity over the alleged ₹ 64-crore loan (unsecured fully convertible debentures) given to NuPower by Supreme Energy, which was 99.99 per cent owned by Videocon chief Venugopal Dhoot at that time.
 While Chanda Kochhar sat on the credit committee that approved the loan to Videocon, there are allegations of conflict of interest in her husband’s brother, Singapore-based Rajiv Kochhar, performing debt-restructuring work on errant corporate borrowers from ICICI, including Videocon. The restructuring wasn’t commissioned by the bank but by the borrowers.
 Interestingly, the board of ICICI Bank expressed full faith in Chanda Kochhar, whose current tenure as CEO is set to end on March 31, 2019. It had reviewed credit approval processes and found them to be robust, according to a March 28 filing by the bank."
187,2018-05-07,ICICI,"ICICI board meet may take up allegations against CEO
The ICICI Bank board is expected to discuss allegations of conflict of interest against its Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar when it meets on Monday to approve the annual results.
Despite calls for Kochhar to step down, the board so far has staunchly supported her and denied the allegations of any quid pro quo between Videocon Group and ICICI Bank’s chief executive officer (CEO) and her family members, including Deepak Kochhar and his company NuPower Renewables, for a ₹3,250 crore loan given by the bank in 2012.
The Central Bureau of Investigation and the Income Tax authorities are now looking into the issue. “It is up to the board to decide whether it wants to discuss these issues or just stick to the agenda, which is of approving the annual results,” noted a source close to the development, adding that the issue is likely to be discussed, given the concerns raised by various investors.
The ICICI board has six independent directors, including the Chairman MK Sharma and Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India Chairman VK Sharma. LIC has over 9 per cent stake in the lender. The government also has a nominee director on the bank’s board – Lok Ranjan – the Joint Secretary with the Department of Financial Services.
Last month, ICICI Bank Chairman Sharma had also met with institutional investors to clarify their doubts on the issue, but the lender had denied any talks on a succession plan to replace Kochhar.
In her first public interaction since the allegations broke out, Kochhar will also chair the earnings call with analysts and investors as well as the media on Monday evening after the results.
ICICI Bank is the country’s largest private sector lender and analysts expect its net profits to take a hit due to higher provisioning for bad loans. The lender had posted a 32 per cent drop in its net profit for the October to December quarter of 2017-18."

For investors in ICICI Bank, the lacklustre performance of the bank over the past three years hadtempered expectations. Nonetheless, the sharp 30 per cent drop in net profit in 2017-18, owing to a significant rise in bad loan provisioning, remains worrisome.
Just as in the case of Axis Bank, what continues to concern investors is whether the NPA recognition cycle is finally complete or if more pain is to be expected in the coming quarters.
Going by the sheer amount of slippages reported in the latest March quarter, one would presume that the bad loan issue is bottoming out. ICICI Bank reported slippages of ₹15,737 crore in the latest March quarter, of which, about ₹9,900 crore has been on account of the RBI’s new framework for stressed assets, which in effect, does away with all the old restructuring schemes. A significant reduction in the bank’s stressed pool assets is also a positive.
The bank had a notable ₹19,000 crore of outstanding accounts in the watchlist (key source of future stress in the corporate loan book) as of December 2017. This has shrunk to ₹4,728 crore as of March 2018.
Weak links
There are, however, several weak links that still need monitoring.
For one, the bank’s slippages have been in the ₹4,400-4,900-crore range in the first three quarters of FY18. These slippages are still above the levels seen prior to the December 2015 quarter, when bad loans started to rise sharply.
Hence, it needs to be seen if the quarterly slippages remain elevated in the coming quarters as well.
Two, the RBI’s revised framework for stressed assets, supersedes all old restructuring schemes, except where they have been already implemented. For ICICI Bank, such accounts under 5/25 or S4A restructuring schemes (under implementation), stood at about ₹3,000 crore. These will need to be watched in the coming quarters.
Also, while the bank has taken a one-time hit on account of the RBI’s circular in its restructured book, the framework requires banks to report even one day default and draw up resolution plans thereupon.
The potential impact where cases may get referred to IBC on failure of a resolution plan still needs to be seen. Lastly, the watchlist is still over ₹4,000 crore, which could slip into NPAs in the coming quarters.
Optical relief
ICICI Bank has also made use of the dispensation given by the RBI on provisioning norms for large accounts under IBC. Provisioning for the secured portion of the large accounts (from the RBI’s first and second list referred to IBC) up to March 31, 2018, has been brought down from 50 per cent to 40 per cent. Given that the bank had provided for around 56 per cent provisioning for the first list of IBC cases and 36 per cent for the second, the RBI’s leeway has offered respite to earnings in the March quarter.
Also, the bank classified three borrower accounts in the gems and jewellery sector as ‘fraud’ and ‘non-performing’. In the March quarter it made a provision of ₹290 crore through P&L account and ₹505 crore by debiting reserves and surplus as permitted by the RBI. This, too, has offered some optical relief to earnings.
Had it not been for the dispensation in provisioning for IBC cases and the relief on the P&L, earnings may also have slipped into the red in the March quarter.
While on the core front ICICI’s credit growth, driven by retail is noteworthy, in the coming quarters, the performance on the asset quality front will remain the key driver of valuations."
185,2018-05-07,ICICI,"ICICI Bank Q4 profit plunges 50% to ₹1,020 crore as provisions rise
 Private sector lender ICICI Bank on Monday posted a 49.6 per cent drop in its standalone net profit to ₹1,020 crore in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, with a sharp rise in its provisions for bad loans. Its net profit in the fourth quarter of 2016-17 was ₹2,025 crore. 
The board, which met amidst allegations of a quid pro quo in loans given by the bank to a few companies, will meet once again on Tuesday to approve the results.
“The board has already made its stance very clear and we don’t have anything more to add,” said Chanda Kochhar, Managing Director and CEO, ICICI Bank, adding that there was no discussion on the allegations in Monday’s meeting.
“Since it is the beginning of the year, the board will meet again on Tuesday to discuss the strategy and the budget planning,” she said, when asked about the agenda, terming it as a “routine procedure”. 
However, sources said the meeting is not standard procedure and that the directors could discuss the allegations.
The government nominee on the bank’s board, Lok Ranjan, Joint Secretary, Department of Financial Services, did not attend the meeting. 
In a statement on March 28, the board had staunchly supported Kochhar and denied the allegations of a quid pro quo between the Videocon Group and her family members, including her husband Deepak Kochhar and his company, NuPower Renewables, for a ₹3,250-crore loan given by the bank in 2012.
The Central Bureau of Investigation and the income-tax authorities are now looking into the issue.
Full-year profit down 30%
 The standalone net profit of the bank also declined by 30.8 per cent for the financial year 2017-18 to ₹6,777.42 crore, from ₹9,801.09 crore in the previous fiscal.
ICICI Bank also reported a 45 per cent decline in consolidated net profit to ₹1,142 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017-18.
Gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances rose to 8.84 per cent for the fourth quarter from 7.82 per cent in the December quarter and 7.89 per cent in the year-ago quarter. “Gross NPA additions of ₹15,737 crore took place in the fourth quarter of 2017-18. This includes ₹9,968 crore of loans that were under RBI schemes and were classified as standard at December 31, 2017,” the bank said in a release.
Net NPAs were at 4.77 per cent in the quarter ended March 31, compared to 4.20 per cent in the third quarter and 4.89 per cent in the fourth quarter a year ago. 
Kochhar said the bank would focus on lowering net NPAs to 1.5 per cent by March 2020. 
Provisions for bad loans
Provisions for bad loans jumped 128.61 per cent in the fourth quarter to ₹6,625.75 crore from ₹2,898.22 crore a year ago. For 2017-18, provisions rose by 13.8 per cent to ₹17,306.98 crore.
The bank has classified three borrower accounts in the gems and jewellery sector as fraudulent and non-performing with fund-based outstandings of ₹794.87 crore.
Net interest income rose 1 per cent to ₹6,022 crore for the quarter from ₹5,962 crore a year ago.
Net interest margin increased to 3.24 per cent from 3.14 per cent.
“A lot of stress has been recognised and the focus will now be on recovery and resolution,” Kochhar said, adding that the lender plans to increase its retail loans to 60 per cent of overall loans while decreasing its exposure to overseas loans to 10 per cent of the whole loan book.
It will also continue to do corporate and project loans but the exposure will be smaller, she added.
The board of directors has also recommended a dividend of ₹1.50 per equity share for 2017-18.

The Board of Directors of private sector lender ICICI Bank is understood to have stuck to discussing business plans on the second day of its meeting on Tuesday.
Government-nominee Director on the Board, Lok Ranjan, did not turn up for the meeting.
Ranjan, who is Joint Secretary in the Department of Financial Services, was also absent for Monday’s meet to approve the annual results of the bank.
Sources said the Board of Directors did not discuss the allegations of quid pro quo surrounding the bank’s Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and his company NuPower Renewables, and the ₹3,250-crore loan given to the Videocon Group in 2012.
‘Routine procedure’
Addressing reporters after the annual results on Monday, Kochhar had said the loan allegations were not discussed and that the board has already made its stance very clear on the issue.
She had also termed the second day of the board meeting as a “routine procedure” to discuss the strategy and the budget planning of the bank at the start of the financial year.
Sources said the government continues to keep a close watch on the developments at the lender, but does not want to get closely involved in the allegations and charges of misconduct.
“Investigative agencies, including the CBI and the Income Tax department, are already looking into the allegations,” said a person familiar with the development, pointing out that the Reserve Bank of India is also aware of the issues at hand.
ICICI Bank had posted a near 50 per cent drop in net profits in the fourth quarter of 2017-18 due to a spike in provisions for bad loans. It had also unveiled a Vision 2020 to address non-performing loans and growth opportunities in retail and digital lending.

 Senior bureaucrat Lok Ranjan, who is the Central Government nominee on the board of ICICI Bank, has been transferred to the Personnel Ministry.
His transfer comes a month after he was appointed on ICICI Bank board whose Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Chanda Kochhar is facing allegations of conflict of interest in sanctioning of 3,250 crore loan to the Videocon group.
Ranjan, a 1989-batch IAS officer of the Tripura cadre, is at present joint secretary in the Department of Financial Services. He has been appointed as joint secretary in the Department of Personnel and Training, according to an official order issued yesterday, without citing further details.
Ranjan was appointed the government’s nominee of the bank, effective April 5, 2018, according to the ICICI Bank’s website. The bureaucrat had on Monday skipped the bank’s board meeting.
The CBI has registered a preliminary enquiry against Videocon founder Venugopal Dhoot and Deepak Kochhar, Chanda Kochhar’s husband, and a few others. It had questioned a few ICICI Bank officials as part of its enquiry to find out if any quid pro quo was involved in the sanctioning of Rs 3,250 crore loan to the Videocon group in 2012.
The CBI had last month questioned Rajeev Kochhar, Chanda Kochhar’s brother-in-law, in connection with its enquiry."
181,2018-05-13,ICICI,"A sombre performance by private banks
 
Healthy loan growth, notable reduction in the stressed assets pool, but a sharp rise in slippages owing to the RBI’s revised framework for stressed assets, just about sum up the March quarter results for leading private sector banks. 
At an aggregate level, a modest growth of 11 per cent in core net interest income (despite healthy growth in loans) and more than doubling of provisions, have led to a 30 per cent y-o-y fall in net profit in the March quarter for private sector banks. 
The sombre performance is mostly attributable to two large banks — ICICI Bank and Axis Bank — together constituting over 70 per cent of the total NPAs of all private banks. 
The banks’ relatively higher exposure to stressed sectors and the RBI’s diktat on stressed assets have weighed on their earnings.
Accelerated NPA recognition
What hung as a Damocles sword over banks in the March quarter was the RBI’s circular issued in February on the revised framework for resolving stressed accounts, which was expected to result in a steep rise in slippages and provisioning. Essentially, the RBI has done away with all the old restructuring schemes.
There has been a significant one-time impact of the RBI’s diktat on ICICI Bank and Axis Bank in the March quarter. 
Axis Bank reported ₹16,536 crore of slippages in the latest March quarter. Restructured accounts under SDR, S4A, 5:25 etc, have fallen to about ₹2,000 crore from nearly ₹7,000 crore in the December quarter. 
ICICI Bank reported slippages of ₹15,737 crore in the March quarter, of which about ₹9,900 crore has been on account of the RBI’s new framework for stressed assets. 
The sharp rise in slippages has resulted in an increase in provisioning, impacting earnings for these banks. 
While net profit for ICICI Bank fell by 49 per cent y-o-y in the March quarter, Axis Bank’s earnings slipped into the red, reporting a loss of ₹2,189 crore for the quarter. 
YES Bank, predominantly a corporate lender though, has seen minimal impact of the RBI’s February circular.
 The bank has seen no slippage during the March quarter from restructured book and no impact on the outstanding restructured book (0.16 per cent of gross advances) as of March 2018.
But just like Axis Bank, YES Bank has been under pressure owing to the sharp bad loan divergence pertaining to FY-17 reported by the bank a few quarters back. But given that some of the accounts have already been repaid in full — classified as NPAs, sold to ARC or upgraded as standard — the actual impact of the divergence has been much lower in the latest March quarter.
Nonetheless, given that banks have been reporting divergences over the last two consecutive fiscals (FY-16 and FY-17),asset quality will need monitoring in the ensuing quarters as well.
HDFC Bank, in comparison to its peers, has managed to maintain a steady asset quality. While in absolute terms, gross non-performing assets have increased by 46 per cent y-o-y in the March quarter, given a healthy growth in loans, GNPA as a per cent of loans is still a manageable 1.3 per cent (though management sees some challenges in the agri book).
Healthy loan growth
Given that the overall loan growth within the banking system stood at around 10 per cent y-o-y as of March 2018, the credit offtake for private sector banks has been healthy. 
HDFC Bank reported 18.7 per cent y-o-y growth in loans, led by retail growth of 27.4 per cent. Axis Bank reported a 18 per cent growth in loans in the March quarter, led by retail that grew by 23 per cent.
ICICI Bank’s domestic loans grew by 15 per cent, again driven by a robust growth of 21 per cent in retail loans. 
YES Bank posted a robust 54 per cent y-o-y growth in loans, both corporate and retail business, driving growth."

ICICI Bank, the country’s largest private lender, on Friday said that market regulator SEBI has served notice on its MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar and the bank in the Videocon loan case.
The notice related to ICICI Bank’s dealings with the Videocon Group and NuPower, an entity in which Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar has a business interest. 
“Appropriate response would be submitted to the SEBI,” said ICICI Bank in a filing to the bourses on Friday, confirming that the bank and its MD & CEO were in receipt of the SEBI notice on Thursday. 
The Central Bureau of Investigation had launched a preliminary investigation into a ₹3,250-crore loan that ICICI Bank had extended to Videocon in 2012 and the possible role of Deepak Kochhar.
It was alleged that Videocon Chairman Venugopal Dhoot invested ₹64 crore in NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, after Videocon secured a loan from a consortium of banks, including ICICI Bank.
ICICI Bank has denied any wrongdoing in the loan transaction, saying it was part of a consortium of lenders that extended the facility to Videocon.
Last month, ICICI Bank Chairman MK Sharma had asserted that the Board has full confidence in Chanda Kochhar and ruled out any quid pro quo as alleged with regard to the loan given to the Videocon group.
Earlier, ICICI Bank had clarified that none of investors of NuPower Renewables is a borrower of ICICI Bank.
“The MD & CEO and the Bank received a notice from SEBI on May 24, 2018 ... requiring responses on matters relating to alleged non-compliance with certain provisions of the erstwhile Listing Agreement and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015,” said the ICICI Bank in the filing."

“The scope of enquiry would be comprehensive and include all relevant matters arising out of and in the course of examination of the facts and wherever warranted, use of forensics and e-mail reviews and recordal of statements of relevant personnel, etc,” the bank said in a regulatory filing to the bourses on Wednesday.
While the lender did not elaborate on the allegations, it said the whistle-blower complaint disclosed information alleging that Kochhar did not adhere to the Bank’s Code of Conduct, to legal and regulatory provisions relating to “conflict of interest”. It also alleged quid quo pro in dealing with certain customers. 
The Board has now asked the Audit Committee to operationalise its decisions and appoint an independent and credible Head of Enquiry, ICICI Bank added.

Motu was hunched over the daily newspaper when Chotu walked into the room.
Kya haal hai, Motabhai? You seem to be reading something seriously for a change, food review?
This is food for thought, Chotu.
Wow, big words, but what’s the thought Motu?
I’m inspired by this news of ICICI Bank initiating an internal probe against its CEO. Hasn’t it set high standards of corporate governance?
Are you serious, Motu? Initiating a probe after brazening it out for more than two months is not the best example of corporate governance.
Chotu, you’re most uncharitable and unkind. Here is a company that is willing to probe its own CEO on the basis of mere allegations which may not even have an iota of truth in them and you’re not willing to acknowledge it. 
Motabhai, I think you badly need to have your morning dose of lassi and jalebi. Your mind does not seem to be working.
What do you mean? ICICI Bank has set an example by deciding to probe its own CEO.
That’s the problem, Motabhai, the general standards of corporate governance are so low in this country that a bank which sits tight through a raging controversy and finally wilts under pressure of a whistle-blower letter is praised for upholding corporate governance.
Considering that you consider yourself so smart, why don’t you then tell me what ICICI Bank should ideally have done?
Now you’re talking business, Motu. Here, first take a few gulps of this lassi, that will set your mind working. Here’s the deal. ICICI Bank is the second largest private sector bank in India...
Hang on Chotu, you’re wrong. I know for a fact that it is the largest private sector bank and the second largest bank behind SBI.
Motabhai, you seem to have done some homework and I’m impressed. But, as usual, you’re not fully updated. HDFC Bank has upstaged ICICI Bank in the last few quarters and is now the second largest bank in India and the largest private sector bank.
Ok Chotu, since you’re a BusinessLine reader, I’ll not dispute your knowledge...
ICICI Bank has built a tremendous franchise in its business. The allegations against its CEO, though unproven, are serious. Mind you, the investigative agencies have taken cognisance of the allegations and are also probing her relatives.
So?
The stock has taken a hit in the market and major investors are worried. Remember, trust is everything in the banking business. But yet, the CEO and the bank have been unmoved. It may be that the CEO is squeaky clean and these allegations are mere mudslinging. But how’re we to know what’s the truth? Perception is everything in public life and that is something not favourable to the CEO now.
True, but what more can she do? Her board has reposed its faith in her and her Chairman came out swinging in her support just a month ago....
That’s all fine. In an ideal world the CEO should have stepped down until the allegations were proven wrong. Remember, these are not casual accusations flung at her and she’s setting an example for her colleagues. The highest standards of corporate governance would have demanded that she give the internal probe a free hand by making way for an interim CEO. She could always return once her name is cleared.
But why should she step down when she knows she did no wrong?
Simply because you should not only be clean but also seen to be clean. Remember the agnipareeksha in the Ramayana?"

 ICICI Bank on Friday said that its Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar is still on the job and is on a planned annual leave. “The ICICI Bank board denies having asked Chanda Kochhar to go on leave. She is on her annual leave which was planned in advance,” an ICICI Bank spokesperson said, adding that the board has not appointed any search committee to find her successor.

 Private sector ICICI Bank has initiated the process of appointment of non-executive chairman as the term of incumbent M K Sharma is coming to an end on June 30. 
The process has started and the board has to take a call if the appointment has to be made from the existing pool of independent directors or by inviting an outsider to take up the position, sources said. As the term of the current chairman is coming to an end so a new chairman has to be appointed, sources added. 
Among various independent directors, seasoned banker and former Bank of Baroda chairman and managing director MD Mallya is set to be frontrunner to succeed Sharma. Mallya was recently appointed to the ICICI Bank board as an independent director on May 29. Other independent directors are Uday Chitale, Dileep Choksi, Neelam Dhawan, Radhakrishnan Nair, V K Sharma (LIC Chairman), and Lok Ranjan (government nominee director).
Mounting problems
ICICI Bank is facing the heat in view of the allegations made against its CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar for allegedly providing loans on quid pro quo basis to benefit family members. 
Last week, the board of India’s largest private sector lender ICICI Bank had ordered an independent probe into allegations of ‘conflict of interest’ and ‘quid pro quo’ in Kochhar’s dealing with certain borrowers. 
There are allegations of involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to Videocon group on a quid pro quo basis. It was alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar.
 Last month, market regulator SEBI had served a notice on Kochhar on dealings of the bank with Videocon Group and Nupower. The scope of enquiry would be comprehensive and include all relevant matters arising out of and in course of examination of the facts and wherever warranted, use of forensics/email reviews and recordal of statements of relevant personal, the statement had said. The enquiry, the bank had said, will be conducted by an ‘independent and credible’ person.
The whistle-blower had alleged that the bank’s MD and CEO had not adhered to provisions relating to code of conduct of the bank and legal and regulatory provisions relating to conflict of interest over a period of time and also alleged quid pro quo in the course of Kochhar’s work in dealing with certain customers/borrowers of the bank.
Interestingly in April, the board had expressed full confidence in Kochhar and ruled out any quid pro quo as alleged with regard to certain loan given to Videocon group. The regulator filing, which came today after close of stock market, further said the enquiry will cover all “connected matters” in the course of investigations to bring the matter to a final close."

The Finance Ministry, on Friday, indicated it would stay away from the allegations surrounding ICICI Bank Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar and put the onus on the bank’s board.
“ICICI Bank is a good bank and has robust processes. There is no cause for concern for any stakeholder. The law of the land will take its course,” said Finance Minister Piyush Goyal, adding that the charges are being investigated by the bank’s internal and external committees.
Given autonomy to banks
When asked whether the government would intervene into the issue as it has done in similar circumstances at public sector banks, Goyal said it has given complete autonomy to banks.
“Supervision of banks is being done by the Reserve Bank of India. The government has given complete autonomy to public sector and private sector banks,” he said after a review meeting with PSBs.
“When it comes to ensuring robust good governance practices at the 21 PSBs, we take an active engagement,” he said, adding that it is the job of the boards of private banks to look into similar issues.
Goyal’s comments explain the government’s stance on allegations of quid pro quo and corporate misconduct against Kochhar in loans given by the bank to the Videocon Group and the Essar Group in return for funds to her husband Deepak Kochhar’s firm NuPower Renewables.
Until now, the Finance Ministry had remained silent on the issue and the government’s nominee director on the board of ICICI Bank, Lok Ranjan, also did not attend meetings at the bank last month.
While the board of the bank had staunchly supported Kochhar and dismissed the allegations, it has now initiated an internal probe after an anonymous whistleblower complaint.
The Central Bureau of Investigation and the Income Tax Department are also looking into the allegations. The allegations are also on the radar of market regulator SEBI, which had sent a showcause notice to ICICI Bank and Kochhar on May 23.
Kochhar and the bank are understood to have sought an extension to respond as the June 7 deadline. Sources said that the bank has not finalised its response but could seek to settle the case."

 As multi-agency probe continues in India into alleged lapses involving ICICI Bank’s chief Chanda Kochhar and her family members, the matter has also come under the scanner of the US markets regulator SEC. Besides, the Indian regulators and investigative agencies are mulling seeking help from their overseas counterparts including in Mauritius as part of their own probes, officials said.
When asked about its probe into matters related to ICICI Bank and Kochhar, a spokesperson for the SEC Office of Public Affairs declined to comment. The queries sent to ICICI Bank also remained unanswered. The bank has already instituted an independent enquiry into allegations of ‘conflict of interest’ and ‘quid pro quo’ in Kochhar’s dealing with certain borrowers.
Earlier in March, when the reports first surfaced in this regard, the bank had said that its board has “full confidence and reposes full faith” in Kochhar. Sources said the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is actively looking into the matter as ICICI Bank is listed in the US also and it may seek further details from its Indian counterpart the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which has already issued show-cause notices to ICICI Bank and Kochhar as part of its probe.
Officials said the SEBI has been approached for some clarificatory details which would be provided to the bank and its CEO, among others to whom notices have been served. Those looking into the matter also include the banking regulator RBI and the Corporate Affairs Ministry, while the CBI had earlier registered a preliminary enquiry against Kochhar’s husband, among others, and extensively questioned her brother-in-law in April.
The cases under scanner include the bank’s Rs 3,250 crore loan to Videocon Group in 2012 and the involvement of Kochhar family members in restructuring of the loan.
Last week, Interim Finance Minister Piyush Goyal said the law will take its own course in the alleged case of nepotism at ICICI Bank, even though it is a good bank with “very robust processes” and there was no cause for concern for any of the stakeholders of ICICI Bank per se.
Allegations
There are allegations of impropriety in ICICI Bank extending loans to some companies and enjoying reciprocal benefits. It has been alleged that family members of the bank’s chief, including her husband Deepak Kochhar, got financial favours from the borrowers against the loans sanctioned by the bank.
It was also alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar. SEBI has served a notice on Kochhar on dealings of the bank with Videocon Group and Nupower.
There are also allegations that NuPower got investments of Rs 325 crore from Mauritius-based Firstland Holdings, a company owned by Nishant Kanodia, son-in-law of Essar Group co-founder Ravi Ruia.
An independent probe was ordered by ICICI Bank board after fresh allegations of quid pro quo were levelled by activist and whistle-blower Arvind Gupta, who also accused Ruia brothers of Essar group of having got undue favours from the bank for “round-tripping” investments into NuPower Group.
The allegations have been dismissed as “motivated” by the Essar Group, which maintains it has no business interest in Firstland Holdings. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs is looking into companies involved in the ICICI Bank controversy of alleged conflict of interest in Chanda Kochhar’s dealings with certain borrowers, according to a senior official.
The official also said the affairs of ICICI Bank are not being looked into by the ministry as that is completely under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). “The ministry is looking at allegations with respect to fraudulent, preferential or under-valued transactions... (related to) those companies which have come into controversy in the light of ICICI Bank issue,” the official said."

167,2018-06-15,ICICI,"Fitch lowers Axis Bank’s outlook to negative, cuts ICICI’s support ratings 
 Global ratings agency Fitch today said ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have “gaps” in their risk control mechanisms and has revised down its outlook on the latter to negative on sour assets worries.
“Both the banks exhibit gaps in risk controls. An ongoing investigation at ICICI Bank on extending a loan with a potential conflict of interest has also focused authorities’ attention on the bank’s governance,” it said in a note. The report also warns that adverse findings may create a “reputational risk”, especially if they point at broader weaknesses in management.
The agency cut its outlook on Axis Bank’s issuer default rating to negative from stable, pointing to the high proportion of NPAs and the limited capital buffers available, despite a recent infusion. It can be noted that a spike in NPAs and provisioning for the same have led the bank, which is searching for a new head after the board agreed to cut short Shikha Sharma’s tenure, to report its first ever quarterly loss in Q4 of FY18.
Commenting on ICICI Bank, the report said, “capital buffers are better even though it has experienced similar financial deterioration like Axis Bank in the previous few financial years.” 
The agency also downgraded ICICI Bank’s ‘support rating’ to ‘3’, from ‘2’, apart from revising down its support rating floor to ‘BB+’, from ‘BBB-’ But the agency has affirmed the issuer default ratings and viability ratings of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at ‘BBB-’ and ‘bbb-’, respectively.
 It can be noted that both the private sector lenders have had a tumultuous time in the past few months. While ICICI Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive Chanda Kochhar is facing allegations of conflict of interest and lack of disclosures, it has been NPAs and the ensuing management change that is dogging Axis Bank.
 Media reports initially said the RBI was unhappy to extend Sharma’s tenure by three years, after which she requested to cut the tenure, which was accepted by the board. Fitch, which has a negative outlook on domestic banks, said the new regulatory NPAs that has accelerated bad-loan recognition, will help improve the health of the banking sector over the long-term.
The report has further said the present NPA ratios make it believe that there has been a full recognition of the legacy problems and the ongoing bankruptcy resolutions can also help positively. “We expect the internal capital generation for the sector, including the two private sector banks, to stay weak in FY19,” it added.
The larger private sector lenders have robust deposit franchises but enjoy less depositor confidence than state-owned banks due to the latter’s government ownership, but this could lead to greater changes in funding costs and liquidity in “an extreme scenario”, the report warns."

 With its Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar battling allegations of corporate misconduct and quid pro quo (exchanging favours) in sanctioning of loans, ICICI Bank on Monday evening announced a reshuffle of its top management.
Sandeep Bakhshi, who is the chief of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, has been appointed Wholetime Director and Chief Operating Officer of ICICI Bank. 
Kochhar will continue to remain the MD and CEO but has decided to go on leave until the internal enquiry against her is completed, in what the bank described as the “highest levels of governance and corporate standards”.
“Bakhshi will report to Chanda Kochhar, who will continue in her role as MD & CEO of ICICI Bank,” said the bank in a regulatory filing with bourses, adding that during her period of leave, the COO-designate would report to the Board.
The decisions were taken at the end of the day-long meeting of the Board.
Bakhshi had served as Deputy Managing Director of the private sector bank prior to moving to ICICI Prudential Life Insurance in August 2010.
His appointment as COO will be for a period of five years, subject to regulatory approvals. He will take charge in his new role from Tuesday or when regulatory and other approvals are obtained. 
Bakhshi will be responsible for handling all businesses and corporate centre functions at ICICI Bank, and all Executive Directors on the Board and the executive management will report to him.
The lender’s board has also recommended the appointment of NS Kannan as MD and CEO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company. Kannan is currently an Executive Director at ICICI Bank.
The reshuffle comes after the bank named retired Supreme Court judge, Justice BN Srikrishna, as the head of its internal probe into complaints against Kochhar by an anonymous whistleblower. 
Though the bank’s board had initially backed the CEO, pressure was mounting on Kochhar to either step down or recuse herself from the daily operations of the lender until the enquiry was completed.
Kochhar, who is presently on her annual leave, has been caught up in allegations of quid pro quo in loans sanctioned by the bank to the Videocon Group and the Essar Group in return for funds given to her husband Deepak Kochhar’s firm, NuPower Renewables."

Delhi’s dharna politics
A week has gone since Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal launched a sit-in protest along with his three senior Cabinet colleagues at the Lieutenant-Governor’s (LG) office demanding his immediate intervention to end the alleged strike by the bureaucrats and ensure the door step delivery of ration to the people, but there is no solution in sight to the dismay of the people of Delhi.
Kejriwal’s demand for full statehood for Delhi and more autonomy in the affairs of state administration are legitimate, but his dharna politics to press home his demands leave a lot to be desired. Observations by the political analysts that the ruling BJP at the Centre has been making efforts to further curtail the powers of the elected government led by Kejriwal in order to weaken him politically cannot be brushed aside easily as baseless. In the ongoing stand-off between the Lt Governor and Delhi Chief Minister, the issues of governance and public welfare have taken a back seat. It is hoped Kejriwal gets down to the business of governance sooner than later by keeping his politics of activism at bay.

New guard at ICICI Bank
While the probe into the allegation of conflict of interest against Chanda Kochhar is welcome, had it not been for public pressure, the bank would have continued its denial mode of any wrongdoing on her part. Kochhar’s decision to step aside till the probe gets over can’t be called as “the highest levels of governance and corporate standards” because it’s being done only after an independent probe has been ordered, not prior to it. Though the unproven charges have seriously dented the image of one of the largest, efficiently-run private banks in the country, the probe and the appointment of Sandeep Bakhshi as the interim Wholetime Director and Chief Operating Officer did drive home the point that the bank is serious in probing the allegations.

Dastardly act
With reference to ‘A story of courage’ under fire’ (June 19), the dastardly killing of Shujaat Bukhari has shocked the entire nation especially the press fraternity. It is all the more painful and surprising that Mehboba Mufti government in Kashmir has utterly failed to protect the journalist, who was instrumental in bringing peace and harmony in Kashimir valley. As a journalist, Bukhari’s contributions were undeniable and outstanding. The staff members were bold enough to bring out ‘Rising Kashmir’ edition.
As usual after Bukhari’s death, leaders across party lines including our Home Minister have expressed shock and dismay. But one wonders whether this is enough. The urgent need of the hour is for both the Kashmir government and the Centre to chalk out a strong strategy to control the militancy in Kashmir with an iron hand. No leniency should be shown to the militants, who are bent on destroying democracy in Kashmir and putting the freedom and human rights of the citizens at stake. Each life is precious and the militants should not be allowed to kill the innocents and our brave soldiers.

 Former Bank of Baroda Chairman and Managing Director MD Mallya is being seen as the top contender for the role of Non Executive Chairman of ICICI Bank.
An experienced public sector banker, Mallya is perceived as being “more proactive” and could succeed current ICICI Bank Chairman MK Sharma when his term expires at the end of the month. 
Both the government as well as state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India, which are shareholders in the lender, are also understood to be in favour of Mallya.
LIC Chairman VK Sharma is an independent director on the Bank’s Board along with Lok Ranjan, who is the Government Nominee Director on the board. 
Until now, the Finance Ministry has tried to keep away from the controversy surrounding ICICI Bank Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar. Ranjan has not attended Board meetings while Finance Minister Piyush Goyal had said the charges are being investigated by the bank’s internal and external committees.
“It is felt that the Board could have handled the allegations in a better way from the start and prevented some of the tumult. Mallya has a proven track record and vast experience in banking and could be a good choice,” said a source.
Mallya had been appointed to the Board of ICICI Bank as an independent director on May 29. Before joining Bank of Baroda, he had also served as the CMD of Bank of Maharashtra.
ICICI Bank is expected to hold its next Board meeting on June 27. 
Other independent directors on the Bank’s Board include Uday Chitale, Dileep Choksi, Neelam Dhawan and Radhakrishnan Nair.
“Discussions have already started informally. The other option would be to bring someone from the outside but with the current reshuffle in the top management, it may not be desirable,” noted the source.
With Kochhar facing allegations of corporate misconduct in loans sanctioned to the Videocon Group and the Essar Group, the Bank’s Board has initiated an internal inquiry headed by retired Supreme Court judge Justice BN Srikrishna.
On Monday, the Bank’s Board announced that Sandeep Bakhshi, who was till now the chief of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, has been appointed as Wholetime Director & Chief Operating Officer designate, ICICI Bank.

ICICI Bank is also understood to be in touch with the RBI over a proposal to appoint a new Non-Executive Chairman as the current incumbent MK Sharma’s term gets over at the end of the month.

 ICICI Bank on Friday said a whistle-blower had in March alleged irregularities in 31 borrower accounts, which had led to incorrect classification of assets, accounting of interest income and NPA recoveries as fees, and over-valuation of security for corporate loans.
The private sector lender said the position in respect of the 31 loan accounts, as on March 31, 2018, was that the loans outstanding were classified as non-performing, with provisions made as per applicable norms.
“These accounts were classified as non-performing between the year ended March 31, 2012 (FY2012) and the year ended March 31, 2017 (FY2017), other than two accounts which were classified by December 31, 2017,” the bank said in a notice to the bourses.
“Thus, all these loans had been classified as non-performing prior to the bank becoming aware of the complaint. The aggregate loans (gross of prudential/ technical write-offs) outstanding at March 31, 2018 were ₹60.82 billion ($898 million), about 1.1 per cent of gross of gross loans,” the notice said.
The provision coverage, including prudential/ technical write-offs, was 50 per cent.
The bank said that based on the procedures performed in the enquiry (by the head of the Internal Audit Group under the supervision of the Audit Committee), the allegations relating to incorrect accounting of interest income and NPA recoveries as fees, and over-valuation of security for corporate loans, were not borne out.
“In certain accounts, transactions were observed that may have delayed the classification of the account as non-performing under Indian GAAP in earlier years. As mentioned earlier, all the above loans had been classified as non-performing and provided for as per applicable norms by December 31, 2017 itself,” the bank said.
The notice said statutory auditors were provided periodic updates and their inputs factored in to the enquiry process.
“The interim report of the enquiry was reviewed in detail by the Audit Committee and statutory auditors, prior to finalisation of the accounts for the year ended March 31, 2018 (FY2018).
“The findings in the interim report had no material impact on the financial statements for FY2018. The interim report has also been submitted to the regulator,” the bank said."
157,2018-06-25,ICICI,"SEBI may favour adjudication proceedings against Kochhar, ICICI Bank
 ICICI Bank Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar, who is facing allegations of quid pro quo in loans to the Videocon Group, is likely to stick to her previous stance that she was unaware of the business dealings between her husband Deepak Kochhar and Venugopal Dhoot.
However, the preliminary examination report by SEBI is understood to have favoured adjudication proceedings against ICICI Bank and Kochhar and has concluded that there was a conflict of interest in the transactions.
The adjudication process is likely to be started after formal responses from Kochhar and ICICI Bank, said an official familiar with the development. The bank, in its reply, is also expected to refer to the ongoing independent enquiry into the issue by retired Supreme Court judge Justice BN Srikrishna.
If the adjudication proceedings find reasonable cause, ICICI Bank could face a penalty between ₹25 lakh and ₹25 crore, while Kochhar could be fined ₹1 lakh—₹1 crore.
Sources said SEBI’s preliminary examination report found that Kochhar has admitted that her husband Deepak Kochhar had business dealings with the Videocon Group for many years.
“The Bank and its MD & CEO received a show-cause notice seeking a response as to why an inquiry should not held against them under the SCR Rules. ... An appropriate response ... would be submitted within the timeline provided,” said an ICICI Bank spokesperson."

MD Mallya was appointed as ICICI Bank’s independent director on May 29


Private sector ICICI Bank is expected to take a decision on appointing a new Chairman to replace current incumbent MK Sharma by the end of the month.
While the former Bank of Baroda Chairman and Managing Director MD Mallya continues to be seen as the top contender for the post, sources said the lender may postpone a decision for some time. In such a case, board meetings can be chaired by one of the independent directors.
A decision is expected at the next meeting of the board of directors of ICICI Bank this week as Sharma’s term ends on June 30. He is understood to have indicated that he does not wish to continue.
Mallya, a seasoned banker who had also served as the CMD of Bank of Maharashtra and Chairman of the Indian Banks Association, is understood to be the top choice of most directors. The board of ICICI Bank has also been in contact with the Reserve Bank of India for its approval.
CBI probe
However, Mallya, along with five other former officials of Bank of Baroda, was questioned this year by the Central Bureau of Investigation with regard to the ₹2,919-crore alleged loan fraud by Rotomac.
“This is the only issue, which could pose a problem with foreign investors. Otherwise Mallya is the top choice,” said a source familiar with the development, adding that the bank board will have to take a decision with the RBI approval.
Alternatively, it could look to induct fresh people on the board, who can later serve as the Non-Executive Chairman of ICICI Bank.
Mallya was appointed to the board of ICICI Bank as an independent director on May 29. Other independent directors on the board include Uday Chitale, Dileep Choksi, Neelam Dhawan and Radhakrishnan Nair. The private sector lender is looking to improve its image with investors and customers after the recent allegations over corporate misconduct and quid pro quo against its Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar in loans given to the Videocon Group. Kochhar is on indefinite leave until an independent inquiry initiated by the board, under former Supreme Court judge Justice BN Srikrishna, is completed."

Soft-spoken and cordial, ICICI Bank’s new Non-Executive Chairman Girish Chandra Chaturvedi is an efficient and able administrator who keeps a cool head.
This will come in useful to 65-year-old Chaturvedi, a former IAS officer of the Uttar Pradesh cadre from the 1977 batch, as he begins work at one of the largest yet most-troubled private sector lender in the country.
“Even as Petroleum Secretary, where there is huge work pressure, he was always calm and told his junior colleagues not to take undue worry,” said an official who has worked with him.
This quality will keep him in good stead, as he faces a twin agenda – to improve the reputational image of the bank, and to strengthen its asset quality.
Chaturvedi has been associated with the banking sector through previous stints at the Department of Financial Services, where he served as Additional Secretary, and as Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Banking and Insurance.
He has also served as the government nominee director on the boards of various banks and insurance firms.
He joins ICICI Bank at a time when its Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar is on leave even as an investigation is ongoing into allegations of her corporate misconduct and quid pro quo in loans given to the Videocon Group in lieu of funding to her husband Deepak Kochhar’s firm, NuPower Renewables.
Image makeover needed
The image of the board of the bank has also taken a beating, with questions over corporate governance practices, as it initially gave Kochhar complete support without looking into the charges.
Meanwhile, ICICI Bank is also battling high non-performing assets with its fourth quarter profits dropping nearly 50 per cent to ₹1,020 crore on the back of high provisioning.
“His appointment shows that the bank is serious about clearing up recent controversies and getting back to business. As a former bureaucrat, the Finance Ministry and the Life Insurance Corporation of India, which are both shareholders in the bank, will also have more comfort in dealing with him,” noted a former public sector banker, who did not wish to be named.
Another private sector lender, Axis Bank, also has a former bureaucrat – Sanjiv Mishra – as its Director and Non-Executive Chairman (part-time).
Born in January 1953, Chaturvedi is a first class post-graduate degree holder in Physics and did his MSc in social policy from the London School of Economics. He also has a doctorate in economic history from the University of Oxford."

 ICICI Bank has crossed a milestone by supporting 17 lakh women beneficiaries in Tamil Nadu through the ‘Self-Help Group-Bank Linkage Programme’ (SBLP), which aims at empowering less privileged women to become self-reliant. 
According to an official statement, the programme focuses on delivering financial products and services to the section of rural people who lack access to formal banking. As part of the programme, the bank has extended loans worth nearly Rs 4,300 crore to over 1.3 lakh SHGs since its inception in 2011, making it the largest private sector lender to SHGs in Tamil Nadu.
Nabard has recognised the bank’s efforts, awarding it the first prize among ‘Private Sector Commercial Banks’ for ‘Excellence in Performance’ under SBLP in Tamil Nadu for the third consecutive year.
A bank statement quoting Avijit Saha, Senior General Manager & Head, Rural & Inclusive Banking Group, ICICI Bank, said, “We at ICICI Bank believe that women are the backbone of every household. In Tamil Nadu, women residing in rural and semi-urban locations have showcased an inspirational entrepreneurial spirit. This reaffirms our belief that access to financial assistance from the bank will help them participate in the economic development of the country and achieve financial security. We would focus on SHGs whose members are engaged in livelihood generating activities - be it on or off the farm – and thereby provide financial assistance in scaling up their economic enterprises. By the end of FY’20, the bank intends to expand its reach to over 25 lakh women beneficiaries with cumulative loan disbursements worth more than Rs 7,000 crore.”
Self-Help Group (SHG) is a term used for a group of 10-20 less privileged women, primarily from rural and semi urban areas, who pool their resources on a periodic basis and use this money for income generating activities such as agriculture and allied activities, production of incense sticks, sarees and textile weaving, production of food materials like papad, running toy and flower shops at temples, trading artificial jewellery, tailoring and trading in fruits and vegetables, among others.
The bank provides door-step banking services to SHGs, eliminating the need for them to visit the branch. The bank representatives submit the loan applications and the details of the SHG to the bank from the field digitally using a tablet, in a paperless manner, which cuts down the turnaround time. This reduces transaction costs for the customers.
ICICI Bank performance in SBLP across Tamil Nadu has also been recognised by the District Collectors of 12 districts including Ramanathapuram, Cuddalore, Madurai, Kanyakumari, Villupuram, Ariyalur, Dharmapuri, Namakkal, Tuticorin, Trichy, Tiruvannamalai and Tirunelveli."

Indian banks may be investing heavily to ramp up their digital offerings, but most of them are still behind global benchmarks when it comes to their online banking website, according to a survey by market research firm Forrester.
The report said that ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank deliver good online banking functionality and user experience, but other Indian banks are way behind. Poor or missing functionality, weak search, navigation, and error-handling capabilities mean they fail to meet customers’ expectations at times. “Forty-two per cent of Indian online banking customers use branches because some banking activities can only be performed in person. For example, disputing a fraudulent transaction still requires customers to submit paper forms at a branch.
“There is a clear need to improve online banking capabilities to offer more comprehensive, innovative, and enhanced banking features that meet customers’ evolving needs,” the research firm said in its report, The Forrester Banking Wave: Indian Online Banking Websites, Q3 2018.
“Unfortunately, our reviews found that many experiences miss the mark. Indian banks have prioritised investments in mobile banking apps, neglecting online banking and putting future business growth at risk by failing to design services that meet the changing needs of their customers,” it added.
The study is based on detailed analysis of 50 functionality and 30 user experience criteria.
Privacy and security
On security and privacy, the report said that aside from HDFC Bank, most of the banks it reviewed do a poor job of educating customers on security topics such as online fraud.
Self-service features that let customers initiate or complete requests without having to interact with a bank employee are becoming important.
“To boost trust, banks must offer the ability to dispute a transaction, especially in the face of rising electronic transaction fraud.

 Private sector lender ICICI Bank reported a net loss of ₹119.55 crore for the first quarter of the fiscal year as its provisions more than doubled due to losses in its treasury portfolio. This was the first time the lender, which is the third largest bank in the country by assets, has reported a quarterly loss. 
The lender was widely expected to show an improvement in its balance sheet after its profits had halved to ₹1,020 crore in the fourth quarter of 2017-18. The results were announced after market hours but with expectations of a turnaround, the bank’s shares had gained 2.62 per cent on the BSE to close at ₹293.30 apiece. ICICI Bank reported net interest income of ₹6,102 crore for the quarter ended June 30, which was 9.15 per cent higher than the ₹5,590 crore reported in the first quarter last fiscal. 
Other income rose 13.69 per cent to ₹3,851.81 crore for the quarter under review. 
Net interest margin dips
However, the net interest margin, a key indicator of a bank’s performance, dipped marginally to 3.19 per cent in the first quarter from 3.23 per cent a year ago. 
Significantly, ICICI Bank, which has been in the midst of a storm with allegations against its Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar, who is now on leave, did not hold the usual media call after the results. Newly appointed Chief Operating Officer Sandeep Bakhshi only interacted with investors and analysts. The bank’s gross non-performing assets rose to 9.65 per cent as a percentage of gross advances or ₹53,464.94 crore as on June 30, 2018, compared to 8.84 per cent a year ago and 9.90 per cent as on March 31, 2018. 
The bank’s provisions rose 129 per cent to ₹5,971.29 crore from the ₹2,608.74 crore it had allocated a year ago. 
“While the gross additions to NPAs at ₹4,036 crore were the lowest in the last 11 quarters, additional provisions on existing NPAs under Reserve Bank of India guidelines (ageing-based provisions and provisions for cases directed by the RBI to be referred to the National Company Law Tribunal), resulted in total provisions of ₹5,971 crore and a net loss of ₹120 crore in the first quarter,” ICICI Bank said in a statement. 
Mark-to-market losses on the AFS and HFT portfolio aggregated ₹ 219 crore and the lender said it has such losses in the first quarter of the fiscal. 
Total recoveries in the first quarter of the fiscal amounted to ₹ 2,036 crore. It has also made an additional provision of ₹ 706.78 crore towards accounts under insolvency in the first quarter of the fiscal.
On a consolidated basis, the bank declared a net profit of ₹5 crore for the first quarter of the fiscal year.

139,2018-07-31,ICICI,"How ICICI Bank, arms compare with peer HDFC group?
With most of the key subsidiaries listed now, comparison between ICICI Bank and HDFC group shares deserves attention or seems to be well-timed. HDFC and HDFC Bank have been definitely and consistently superior than ICICI Bank in terms of important financial metrics. Accordingly, their shares have significantly outperformed ICICI Bank with market capitalisation jumping more than five and 12 times, respectively, in the last one decade, compared to the latter’s three times, according to Capitaline data.
Even HDFC’s newly-listed subsidiary, HDFC Standard Life Insurance, has done better than ICICI Prudential Life Insurance though listing dates are different. The stock of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance has gained close to 42 per cent in almost two years of listing, while HDFC Standard Life is up 44 per cent in just eight months.
According to analysts, premium valuations of HDFC group’s shares are indeed justified but currently they are fairly valued and most offer limited upside.
On the other hand, ICICI Bank and its subsidiaries, which have underperformed HDFC group due to a variety of reasons, can be considered as value buy, they added.
“While the company (HDFC) is tracking steady core performance, its valuation at 3.1 times adjusted book value for core return on equity of 16.5 per cent appears to be fair,” said Kunal Shah, analyst at Edelweiss. He expects 9 per cent upside from current levels.
ICICI Bank may rise 18%
Prabhudas Lilladher has increased the target price on HDFC Bank by 9 per cent to ₹2,492 (to factor in fund-raising) and retained its ‘buy’ rating on the stock. ICICI Bank also offers similar upside of 18 per cent based on average target prices estimated by analysts on both stocks. If things go well at ICICI Bank financially and otherwise (read management and regulatory issues), then the upsides could be even more, given its rock bottom valuation of 1.2 times price-to-adjusted-book-value estimated for FY20.
“Core operating profit remains healthy (+13 per cent year on year); new NPA addition moderates (slippages at 3.1 per cent of loans) and loan growth (+11 per cent) gathers pace. We see provisions remain elevated in the near term (FY19E); however, we draw comfort in the pace of resolution and 69 per cent coverage ratio (combined) against list-1 and list-2 IBC accounts. Capital position remains healthy; subsidiaries remain profitable. Valuations continue to remain undemanding,” pointed out Centrum in its post-June quarter results.
HDFC Securities has a similar view and added: “Despite building in relatively lower recoveries and cutting earnings by 31 per cent and 5 per cent for FY19 and 20, respectively, ICICI Bank can yield return on average assets of 1.11 per cent in FY20. This, and inexpensive valuations, drive our positive view. Further dilution in subsidiaries and robust recoveries could push earnings upwards.”
Insurance segment
Between the life insurance subsidiaries, analysts are more bullish on ICICI Prudential Life insurance in the near term as they expect 21 per cent upside versus HDFC Standard Life’s 2 per cent. This is mainly due to time correction in the HDFC Standard Life stock thanks to its high valuation following robust listing and post-listing performance.
Also, though HDFC Standard Life is estimated to report higher growth in new business APE (annualised premium equivalent) and VNB (value of new business) over FY18-FY20, Motilal Oswal expects improvement in VNB margin for ICICI Prudential Life Insurance from the current 17.5 per cent, and the same to be sustained at 24 per cent in case of HDFC Standard Life.
HDFC Asset Management Company’s initial public offer got subscribed a whopping 83 times thanks to robust financial performance and superior brand image/market position. Even though the listing performance will be robust thanks to huge response from investors, it might again see a time correction later on as happened in HDFC Standard Life Insurance. At the upper end of the price band, it is already valued higher at 32 times FY18 earnings/7.8 per cent to FY18 AUM, compared to 26 times/5.6 per cent in case of Reliance Nippon Life AMC.
There are no fresh analyst views on ICICI Securities and ICICI Lombard General Insurance after their listings in April 2018 and September 2017, respectively."

In its post-earnings call with analysts and investors on July 27, the lender’s newly-appointed Chief Operating Officer Sandeep Bakhshi is understood to have expressed confidence of a recovery from the second quarter onwards, and also cleared doubts on the investigations with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
“Investors and analysts were told that the bank is working with the SEC on all issues and hopes for a closure soon,” two persons familiar with the development said, adding that Bakhshi had stressed that the bank’s operations were not being impacted by the investigations.
ICICI Bank, the country’s third-largest bank by assets, posted its first-ever net loss of ₹119.55 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, due to higher provisioning by nearly 129 per cent at ₹5,971.29 crore in the April to June quarter of 2018-19.
While most analysts were surprised by the results, which were lower than estimates, they remain cautious about the lender’s prospects.
“While ICICI Bank has proactively recognised stress, the large residual pool of BB (and lower) assets (nearly 9 per cent of loans) is worrisome…The management believes provisioning will remain high through 2018-19 as PCR will be beefed up further (currently at 66.1 per cent),” said HDFC Securities in a research report on July 29.
Gautam Chhugani, Director and Senior Analyst, Indian Financials, at Sanford C Bernstein, who was among the first to raise concerns about the lender’s financial performance earlier this year, told BusinessLine in an e-mail response: “It is always a good policy to raise loss coverage and take the losses upfront. In that sense, the first quarter loss was a positive in my view. We will see reducing slippage levels albeit bit volatile and credit costs again driven by resolution events, but nonetheless in the right direction. Though, I am not very positive on margins improving in the short term.”
Inter-creditor agreement
With gross non-performing assets rising to 9.65 per cent as a percentage of gross advances at the end of the first quarter, the bank, on Tuesday, also entered into the inter-creditor agreement for resolution of stressed assets. Bakhshi had also underlined that slippages would come down going forward and that the NPA recognition cycle was almost over.
Similarly, in a research report on Monday, Centrum Broking also said that it expects the lender’s provisions to remain elevated in the near term (2018-19), but “draws comfort” in the pace of resolution and near 69 per cent coverage ratio (combined) against Lists 1 and 2 of IBC accounts.
“Capital position remains healthy; subsidiaries remain profitable. Valuations continue to remain undemanding,” it said.
In its investor presentation after the first quarter results, the bank had highlighted its improving asset quality and healthy advances with an 11.3 per cent year-on-year growth, led by the retail segment.
The management is also understood to have said that it aims to maintain CASA above 45 per cent on a daily average basis and total retail deposits over 70 per cent.
The bank’s scrip fell 1.07 per cent to end at ₹ 303.95 apiece on the BSE."
141,2018-07-31,ICICI,"Provision against bad loans to remain elevated in FY’19: ICICI Bank 
 ICICI Bank has said provisions against bad loans are expected to remain at elevated levels in the current financial year as the lender would have to earmark more funds for meeting RBI norms.
The bank made a provision of Rs 17,307 crore against bad loans in 2017-18 as against Rs 15,208 crore in the year prior to that, the ICICI Bank top management had said in an investors’ call.
In the fourth quarter of 2017-18, the bank’s provisions sharply jumped to Rs 6,626 crore compared to Rs 2,898 crore in the corresponding quarter 2016-17. There are pressures which have come because of additions to non-performing assets in the overseas branches book, it said.
“During fiscal 2019, provisions are expected to remain elevated, although lower than 2017-18,” the bank added. “In the current financial year, that is FY2019, clearly there will be pressure on the overseas margin, especially because we are not growing that book, so in that context any impact which is there becomes more material,” it said.
The bank noted that NPA additions during FY’2019 are expected to be significantly lower than FY’2018. The impact of the revised framework for resolution of stressed assets will need to be closely monitored, it said.
With regard to loss booked by its UK subsidiary in FY’2018, the bank said this was essentially because of the increased level of provisioning on impaired loans, which were largely India-linked loans reflecting the local conditions.
Earlier this month, ICICI Bank reported its first ever quarterly loss of Rs 119.5 crore for the three months to June on account of higher provisioning for bad loans.
The private sector lender, whose MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar was forced to go on leave last month following conflict-of-interest allegations, had posted a net profit of Rs 2,049 crore in the year-ago period.
On a consolidated basis, ICICI Group posted a profit of just Rs 4.93 crore, compared to Rs 2,604.73 crore a year ago. Total income on consolidated basis rose to Rs 29,174.12 crore for the quarter under review, as against Rs 26,517.57 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal, ICICI Bank said in a statement. This is the first ever result announcement since Kochhar went on leave."

134,2018-08-08,ICICI,"Why the run up in private banks may need watching


The fundamental performance of private sector banks does not mirror the market’s exuberance.




The fundamental performance of private sector banks does not mirror the market’s exuberance.


 It is not unknown that private sector banks—with better earnings visibility and a somewhat more resilient show—have been the darlings of the market in the recent past. In the last one year, while the stock prices of PSU banks have fallen sharply, a few private sector banks have continued their strong run. With too much money chasing too few stocks, valuations of some of the private bank stocks are at historical levels.
But interestingly, the fundamental performance of private sector banks does not mirror the market’s exuberance. For one, over the past four quarters, the core net interest income of private sector banks, has been moderating. Slowing loan growth in some of the larger banks, pressure on margins and sudden shocks on the asset quality front have impacted banks’ core income from lending. Two, bad loans have been creeping up too, leading to higher provisioning, impacting earnings. Three, the rise in government bond yields have led to treasury losses, eating into their core income. All of this has led to profit shrinking on a yearly basis for two consecutive quarters for the entire pack.
Core income moderates
While private banks have managed to grow their loan book through market share gains (as their PSU counterparts consolidate balance sheet), strong retail and SME focus and healthy capital base, the growth in core interest income has slipped. From 16 per cent levels in the June quarter last year, growth in net interest income slowed to 12 per cent in the March quarter. While growth has managed to inch up to 14 per cent in the June quarter, a low base and some one-off recoveries in few banks has helped. Sustainability of the trend needs to be seen.
For HDFC Bank, despite the healthy traction in loans, the growth in the bank’s net interest income has slowed in the last two quarters. From 24 per cent YoY growth in the December 2017 quarter, net interest income grew by a slower 17.7 per cent in the March 2018 quarter and by 15.4 per cent in the latest June quarter. For IndusInd, growth has slowed from 31 per cent levels in June quarter of last year to 20 per cent in the June 2018 quarter. From a robust 30-40 per cent growth last year, net interest income growth moderated to 23 per cent in the latest June quarter for YES Bank.
A consistent moderation in growth, not priced into valuations can weigh on stock prices, if markets turn volatile.
Big daddy banks under pressure
Axis Bank and ICICI Bank—two large private sector banks—have weighed heavily on the performance of the entire pack. Core income growth for these banks has in any case been tepid—at flat to low single-digits. Axis Bank’s net interest income growth that inched up to 12 per cent in the June quarter, has been aided by a one-time impact of interest realisation from recovery on an IBC account.
On the asset quality front, after the one-time hit in the March quarter, on account of the RBI’s diktat on stressed assets, slippages still remain elevated for both Axis and ICICI Bank. For Axis Bank, addition to its stressed assets pool remains a concern. For the rest of the private bank universe too, bad loans have been on the rise over the past four quarters.
YES Bank reported sharp divergences in the September 2017 quarter. There has also been a notable rise in gross slippages in the latest June quarter. IndusInd Bank, had reported bad loan divergences pertaining to 2016-17, in the March quarter.
HDFC Bank too has been reporting additions (though modest when compared to peers) to its bad loan book. While the GNPAs for the bank, in absolute terms, has gone up by 30-40 per cent YoY over the past few quarters, a healthy growth in loans has kept delinquency ratio at bay. 
Hence, the divergence report for FY18 will be a key factor to watch for, to assess the big picture on asset quality for private sector banks.
Overall the profit growth for private sector banks fell sharply from 23 per cent in March 2017 quarter to single digits in the December 2017 quarter. In the March and latest June 2018 quarter, profit has shrunk by 37 per cent and 16 per cent respectively for the entire private bank universe. Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, South Indian Bank, Karur Vysya Bank—all recorded a steep fall in profit in the latest June quarter."

ICICI Bank CEO and Managing Director Chanda Kochhar, who is on leave pending a probe into alleged irregularities in the sanctioning of loans, is unlikely to attend the Annual General Meeting of ICICI Securities.
Kochhar, who is the Chairperson of the board of directors of ICICI Securities, is up for reappointment as a director at the company’s AGM on August 30.
“Since going on leave in late June, she has stayed away from board meetings and other functions at ICICI Securities as well as other group companies. The board will nominate some other person to chair the AGM,” said a person familiar with the development.
It is possible that either Shilpa Kumar, Managing Director and CEO of ICICI Securities, or Ajay Saraf, Executive Director of the company, who are whole-time directors on the board, could chair the meeting.
Since going on leave, Kochhar is understood to have not attended the company’s board meeting on July 23, which approved the first quarter financial results.

Earlier, in the JP Infratech case, the Supreme Court had asked the RBI to initiate insolvency proceedings against Jaiprakash Associates, noting that it owes over ₹30,000 crore to 30 banks.
The company’s scrip fell 3.70 per cent and closed at ₹10.68 a piece on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Monday.
Jaiprakash Associates is the flagship firm of the Jaypee Group. Manoj Gaur is its Executive Director and CEO.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2018, the company posted a net loss of ₹285 crore as against a net profit of ₹764.99 crore in the corresponding period a year ago."
122,2018-09-11,ICICI,"ICICI Bank AGM on Sept 12
Private sector ICICI Bank is set to hold its Annual General Meeting on Wednesday, its first since allegations of corporate misconduct and quid pro quo in sanctioning loans were levelled against its Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar earlier this year.
Kochhar, who is on leave of absence pending completion of probe into the allegations, is unlikely to attend the AGM.
The meeting was earlier scheduled for August 10, but was postponed in July due to the sequencing of AGMs of group companies.
This will also be the first AGM of ICICI Bank’s new Non-Executive Chairman GC Chaturvedi as well as that of Chief Operating Officer Sandeep Bakhshi.
The two are expected to field questions from shareholders about the recent controversies surrounding the bank, including the investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation, SEBI, as well as an internal investigation led by retired Supreme Court Judge, Justice BN Srikrishna.
Chaturvedi and Bakhshi, who were appointed just a few months ago, are also likely to spell out their strategy for the coming fiscal year to shareholders and try to ease their concerns about the financial performance of the bank.
The private sector lender had also reported its first-ever quarterly loss of ₹120 crore in the April-June quarter of the fiscal due to higher provisioning for bad loans and treasury losses.
Meanwhile, in a clarification to stock exchanges, ICICI Bank said it has not received any notice from the Income-Tax department on the sale of buildings to Videocon Group.
“We would like to clarify that the bank has not received any notice or communication from the I-T Department in this regard,” it said.
The bank’s scrip fell by 1.94 per cent to close at ₹326.60 apiece on the Bombay Stock Exchange."
121,2018-09-12,ICICI,"ICICI Bank shareholders fear ""reputational risk"" over dismal corporate governance 
The management and the board of directors of the country's second largest bank, ICICI Bank Limited appeared cornered when the shareholders raised serious concerns on the reputational and financial risk looming on the Bank following dismal corporate governance condition.
At the 24th Annual General Meeting of the Bank held in Vadodara on Wednesday, the shareholders expressed disappointment over the performance of the Directors in general and the Managing Director and CEO, Chanda Kochhar in particular.
After the announcement of the day's business and the Agenda of the AGM, which was followed by an Audio-Visual presentation on the performance of the Bank, the shareholders were asked to share their views on the bank's performance. To which, a shareholder named Sunil Hemnani raised serious objection to the 'disappointing' corporate governance from senior management despite being 'rewarded' with 'American-like' perks.
""The Bank's overall growth for the past five years has been 6.5 per cent, which is slowest by private bank's standards. The salaries are comparable to American perks, yet the American corporate governance doesn't come. There is a need for serious introspection. We don't find accountability,"" said Sunil Hemnani.
However, at the onset of the AGM, the non-executive chairman, Girish Chandra Chaturvedi had requested the members to restrict their discussions to the topics pertaining to the AGM notice, and also clarified that the matters relating to the MD & CEO being currently under investigation, wherein a final report is awaited, it would be premature for the bank to comment on it.
Investigation
Yet, there were demands for Kochhar's presence as some of the shareholders tried to shout slogans alleging corruption in the bank. Kochhar is on leave pending an independent investigation by retired Supreme Court judge, Justice B N Srikrishna, into allegations of irregularities in sanctioning loans.
There were shareholders from Mumbai and other cities specially visiting for the AGM, and expressed disappointment at the decision of the Board of directors to re-appoint Kochhar as a director on the board of ICICI Securities.
Heartburn
Shareholders also expressed their heartburn for lower-than-expected dividend declared by the Bank at Rs 1.5 per share. The management responded to the shareholders with an assurance of best governance practices at the Bank from here onwards.
Addressing the gathering of shareholders newly appointed Chief Operating Officer (COO), Sandeep Bakhshi, admitted corporate governance issues in the past and with that objective the board collectively decided to appoint justice Srikrishna for the investigation. ""We should wait for the outcome. In the meanwhile, I can assure the shareholders that we have ring-fenced the bank functioning from this event and as a bank, we are putting a best foot forward and maximise the opportunity and serve the society with the highest standards of governance. We assure you that every step taken by us would be to put our bank in a logical position in the ecosystem,"" said Bakhshi.
He further highlighted the silver-lining in the economy and stated that the economy is returning to its revival. ""Across sector, services, agri, industry and corporate they are making a comeback. We have had a challenge with the NPA in the ecosystem but I am happy to tell our shareholders that we are at the tail end,"" he added.
SEBI
Bakhshi also clarified that there was no order or penalty from the SEBI. ""There was a show-cause notice and the matter is pending adjudication,"" he said adding that regarding Kochhar's appointment at ICICI Securities, ""the MD & CEO is on leave pending investigation and is not attending office of the bank or its subsidiaries. It would not be appropriate on behalf of the board to pre-judge anything pending investigation against her.""
He also clarified about the US SEC action on Bank, saying, ""There is no SEC fine on the Bank.
- A 'fan' shareholder forces Sandeep Bakhshi to leave the chair and get a 'click' with him. 
- A decades-old shareholder of ICICI Bank keeps high hopes from 'senior brains' in the bank. 
- Some senior citizen shareholders upset over absence of Chanda Kochhar. Slogans raised raised against Kochhar and husband Deepak Kochhar alleging corruption in the Bank. 
- Shareholders demand more dividend as Rs 1.5 is 'unexpectedly low'. ""Shareholders pay the price for Videocon case."" 
- Objection of Kochhar's re-appointment as Director in ICICI Securities. 
- Central tone revolved around serious gaps in corporate governance and lack of accountability from the management. 
- Suggestions pour in to re-look at the DNA and strengthen vigilance. 
- ""Bank management good at taking American-like perks but lack on American-like governance."" 
- Angry shareholders give 'poor' evaluation to Kochhar's performance. 
- Suspicion expressed on Board's independent functioning. ""Kochhar was given clean chit by Board in 15 mins, while agencies are taking over 2 months to arrive at a conclusion. 
- Shareholders hold Kochhar responsible for the ""mess"". - Investors raise issues and red-flags risk areas in the balance-sheet on advances."

ICICI Bank on Tuesday said it has submitted its response to the show cause notice issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India but has not filed a settlement application.
“We would like to clarify that we have not filed any application for settlement,” the private sector lender said in a regulatory filing.
ICICI Bank and its Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar are under investigation on allegations of corporate misconduct and quid pro quo in giving loans to the Videocon Group in 2012.
SEBI had sent a show cause notice to the bank and Kochhar in May this year. In their separate responses, the two are understood to have maintained that they did not know about the transactions between Videocon Group and NuPower Renewables, which is run by Deepak Kochhar, Kochhar’s husband.
They are also under examination by the Central Bureau of Investigation and income tax authorities while an internal committee of the bank is also examining the allegations against Kochhar. She is also on a leave of absence until the probe is completed.

117,2018-09-19,ICICI,"NSE, ICICI Bank to be test cases for SEBI’s new settlement norms
 The Securities and Exchange Board of India ‘s new ‘consent mechanism,’ which was approved on Tuesday, could be immediately tested for settlement of high-profile cases such as the alleged preferential access scam at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and regulatory lapses at ICICI Bank involving CEO Chanda Kochhar, legal experts told BusinessLine.
SEBI on Tuesday said that those involved in the NSE matter had filed for settlement. Nearly 28 entities, including exchange and brokerage house officials, have been served show-cause notices by SEBI for misuse of exchange trading systems. 
With regard to ICICI Bank, where SEBI had issued a show-cause notice to the bank and Kochhar for violating disclosure norms regarding conflict of interest in the business dealings of her husband Deepak Kochhar with Videocon Group, the regulator said the bank had informally spoken about settlement.
SEBI’s new consent term has a key clause, which says that the ‘board may not settle any proceeding if it is of the opinion that the alleged default has a market-wide impact, loss to investors, or affects the integrity of the market’. According to legal experts, it would be interesting to see how parties argue in both the matters that there was no ‘market-wide impact.’
“SEBI has kept the definition of market-wide impact open ended but a principle-based approach will be tested to see how certain cases that impacted more than a handful of market participants can be settled. This said, the main idea of reviewing the consent was to clear a huge backlog of cases and the new consent could go a long way since the discrimination between cases to be settled based on the offence has been removed,” said a senior lawyer working in the securities market. 
“The definition of market-wide impact cannot be straitjacketed and the view on settlement may be subjective,” SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi said, while responding to a question from BusinessLine.
Ananta Barua, whole-time member, SEBI, was of the view that sanctity will be maintained in consent proceedings as all the cases will go through a high-powered committee before being settled.
The legal experts said that another SEBI addition to the settlement clause, involving the ‘approver concept’, could help the regulator solve both the NSE and ICICI Bank cases in an effective manner. 
For the first time, SEBI has introduced a ‘confidentiality clause’ in settlement of cases. This will be a variant of the ‘approver’ concept in the US, which is also employed by Indian agencies such as the CBI and the Competition Commission of India.
An offender can expect to get a less-serious charge or a lenient sentence in exchange for vital information that could help crack the case."

The matter was listed before the Mumbai Bench of the NCLT on Wednesday under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
ICICI Bank had earlier approached the NCLT in a case filed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs that sought to attach the properties of Choksi.
ICICI Bank, as the lead banker of a consortium of banks, had informed the NCLT that it had lent close to ₹6,000 crore to Gitanjali Gems. The bank is seeking about ₹600 crore as its own dues. A forensic audit of the books of the jewellery company, which was ordered by the lenders, is understood to have been completed.

ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar




ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar


 
 
Chanda Kochhar’s 34-year association with ICICI Ltd and subsequently ICICI Bank came to a quiet and rather unexpected end on Thursday when she opted for early retirement.
Her sudden exit was seen as surprising by many after her earlier position on the allegations that she had done no wrong, but analysts believe it was long overdue to clear the reputation of the country’s third-largest bank by assets.
“Notwithstanding the significant contribution of Chanda Kochhar in the evolution of ICICI Bank, the organisation’s stakeholders and the investment community would welcome the bank’s decision to move forward. We believe the appointment of the new MD and CEO with a fairly long tenure would help provide much-needed clarity, direction and continuity to the bank. We currently have a hold rating on the stock,” said Lalitabh Shrivastawa, AVP, Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.
Agreed Hemindra Hazari, an independent analyst, said: “Kochhar’s exit from ICICI Bank was long overdue. She should have been dismissed much earlier. This is in stark contrast with public sector banks, and shows the poor corporate governance practices at private lenders.”
Before the allegations against her came to light, Kochhar, who has been heading ICICI Bank since 2009 and was conferred a Padma Bhushan in 2011, was widely seen as a role model for women as she had managed to reach the top position in one of the largest banks in the country.
An alumnus of Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies, she initially joined ICICI Ltd in 1984 as a management trainee, and then worked with ICICI Bank. She headed the infrastructure finance and corporate banking business at the bank.
She was elevated to the board of directors of ICICI Bank in 2001, and was appointed as Joint Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer of the bank in 2007.
She is also widely credited for building the bank’s retail business, and was a favourite of former group chairman KV Kamath. Her appointment as the MD and CEO also led to the exit of Shikha Sharma (Axis Bank chief), who was senior to her in ranking from the group. She also consolidated activities after the lender was impacted by the Lehman crisis.
However, in the last two quarters, problems with non-performing loans had also sprung up at ICICI Bank, which reported its first-ever net loss of ₹119.55 crore in the first quarter of the fiscal.
Sources said that while the decision to seek early retirement was Kochhar’s own, there had been increasing pressure with public outcry over her re-appointment to the board of ICICI Securities. Concerns were flagged at the lender’s annual general meeting last month, even as a more proactive approach was adopted by the bank’s board led by Chairman GC Chaturvedi.
“It is clear that the reputation of the bank was more important than a single individual with the new board led by Chaturvedi and with Chief Operating Officer Sandeep Bakhshi, in contrast to the blanket clearance given by the previous chairman and board members,” noted an expert, who did not wish to be named.
Kochhar was also equally known for her interest in social causes, including vocational education and Swachh Bharat, as well as a penchant for stylish saris."

111,2018-10-05,ICICI,"Exit of Chanda Kochhar
This refers to ‘End of Chanda Kochhar era’ (October 5). The quid pro quo entertained by Chanda Kochhar in handling the loan proposal of Videocon group is a steep fall from grace of a world renowned and powerful woman executive, who enjoyed pre-eminent status in the financial world.
Coming to the larger issue, the unwise closure of DFIs (development financial institutions) by the powers that be is the single most important reason for the present predicament of non-performing assets being faced by banks. The shutting down of DFIs compelled banks to lend long, though the sourcing of resources through deposits was not in alignment as far as tenor was concerned.
Many commercial banks, ICICI Bank included, after burning their fingers in retail lending, embarked on infrastructure and project financing with relatively longer tenors. They encouraged companies to take loans without any specific commercial or tangible asset-creation purpose. These type of borrowings facilitated corporates to divert the funds, resulting in illiquid financial portfolios with banks.
Over-pampered personalities like the then heads of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank went ahead with business expansion without adhering to lending disciple, causing big problems to their institutions.

In the male-chauvinistic corporate world, charismatic women like Indra Nooyi and Kiran Mazumdar Shaw have excelled and succeeded in taking their respective businesses to new heights.
The allegations levelled against Chanda Kochhar, the former CEO of ICICI Bank, should not be allowed to overshadow or underrate her endeavour in building such a dynamic bank. It is a tough and testing time for the Indian corporate sector, where the cases of beleaguered entities are surfacing every month.
Some businesses, which once appeared to be flourishing and thriving, are floundering now due mainly to inefficient management. The people at the helm of any business are expected to be the upholders of business ethics, without giving any room for self-interest or conflict of interests.
Be it the case of Satyam, Kingfisher Airlines, ICICI Bank or IL&FS, the chief cause for failure is poor corporate governance by the top management.

Fuel price cut
The Centre has cut fuel prices by ₹2.50 per litre, but the hard fact remains that the country would continue to import nearly 80 per cent of its crude oil requirement. High fuel prices will slow down every sector of the economy. And, the drag on the economy may yet again usher in a fresh spectre of NPAs.
Therefore, cosmetic single-digit paring of fuel price will not help. It would be wise for the government to absorb substantial fuel costs by compromising on select expenditure, than take the risk of an overall economic retreat consequent to high fuel prices.

Welcome move
The recent move to introduce Air India flights between Bengaluru and Mysuru is a step in the right direction. This will improve Mysuru’s infrastructure and boost tourism especially during Dussera.
As the Civil Aviation Ministry has decided to introduce flights under UDAN scheme for a short period of time, it is time now to look ahead and continue with the arrangements of permanent flight connectivity to Mysuru. This is also the right time to connect Mysuru with other parts of the country.
Currently, Mysuru is connected by air only to Chennai. This move will also attract international travellers to Mysuru.
Through regular movement of flights at Mysuru, the current airport infrastructure may get a boost with the Ministry’s NABH (Nextgen Airports For Bharat) Nirman initiative and UDAN schemes. This will also serve as an opportunity to expand the airport and accommodate wide-bodied aircraft, like Airbus and Boeing, which will help to serve long-haul flights and connect to international sectors directly.

By accepting Chanda Kochhar’s request of an early retirement, the board of directors of ICICI Bank may have ended the uncertainty over leadership at India’s second largest private bank. But neither Kochhar, the board nor the bank’s many independent directors have come out of this entire saga smelling of roses. On Kochhar’s part, the ‘graceful exit’ has come a little too late in the day to mend the damage done to her reputation. The allegations against her included not disclosing conflict of interest caused by certain transactions between certain borrowers of the bank (Videocon group) and entities controlled by her spouse. Propriety demanded that she disclosed the conflict of interest to the board and recused herself from the loan committee at the outset. But by not stepping down when the controversy broke out and even when the board ordered an independent committee headed by BN Srikrishna to probe the matter, she only stoked concerns over corporate governance standards at the bank. The board, instead of offering abstruse statements and coming to her defence, should have upheld high standards of governance and asked her to step down long ago.
The episode — along with the recent IL&FS crisis and the turmoil at private sector banks such as YES Bank and Axis Bank — shows bank boards in poor light. Ever since the bad loan crisis unfolded, it has been PSBs that have been accused of crony capitalism and weak governance. But as has been evident over the past one to two years, the books of many private sector banks too have been overstated. For ICICI Bank, its profits have shrunk by a third over the past five years, while for Axis Bank, its earnings are less than a tenth of what they were five years ago; bad loans for these banks have grown 5-10 fold in the past five years. 
The growing concerns around corporate governance at banks in particular and systemically important financial entities like IL&FS in general, call for greater examination of the role of directors. SEBI accepted about 40 of the 80 recommendations, set out in the Uday Kotak Committee on corporate governance, in March this year. Some of them — Chairperson-CEO separation, capping maximum number of directorships, setting minimum number of directors for the top 1,000 and 2,000 entities, new disclosure requirements on auditor resignations, related party deals and consolidated quarterly results, etc — will help. But implementation in spirit and not letter is the key. The banking system’s crisis of the ‘missing middle’, with not enough talent for critical positions, needs to be addressed, not just at PSU banks but private sector lenders as well. If a shorter tenure of bank chiefs at PSBs prompted them to kick the can down the road, a much longer tenure of officials at private sector banks could also be equally damaging. Re-examining the manner in which these critical positions are filled is essential to prevent a repeat of ICICI Bank-like episodes."

Bribe Giver and taker beware ISTOCK
   -  istock.com/Kritchanut




Chanda Kochhar’s exit from ICICI Bank is yet another reminder of the high levels of corruption that now pervade our society. The annual cost of this, according to CK Prahalad, is $50 billion or about 2 per cent of GDP. But by focussing almost exclusively on legislative solutions to this problem, is the government barking up the wrong tree?
The recent amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act are a case in point. They remove some of the lacunae in the earlier law and will perhaps expedite decision-making at a transactional level; but beyond that, they hardly go to the root of the problem. 
The amended law enhances the maximum punishment for bribery from three years to seven years; and the minimum punishment for such an offence from six months to three years.
Bribe giving has been equated with bribe taking, unless the giver can prove that he was acting under duress and reports the bribe given by him to the authorities within seven days. Corporates involved in bribery cases are now punishable with fine; and superiors make themselves culpable if it can be established that their juniors took part in the act with their approval. They can, however, defend themselves by framing policies that regulate the conduct of their employees.
By amending the definition of “undue advantage”, the new law criminalises all receipts other than legal remuneration. Legally, then, an official accepting gifts makes himself liable for prosecution. Another amendment mandates immediate forfeiture of property unless the official can show that he is covered by the exceptions laid down under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
Delays in trials are sought to be tackled by mandating that they should be concluded within two years; and if that is not possible, a judge can for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend this limit for six months at a time, but in no case beyond four years. In a much-needed relief for innocent officials, “criminal misconduct” has been redefined to include only cases where the official concerned has misappropriated property or possesses assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. The term excludes conferring a benefit to a third party. This is because such an advantage can accrue in almost every decision a public servant takes while dealing with the public.
These amendments will impact administration positively: the amended law for the first time lays down time limits for completion of a trial. This is bound to lead to swifter punishments which in turn will improve deterrence. Honest officials will now be able to take decisions fearlessly without continuously worrying about facing criminal charges for benefiting private parties. By making bribe giving an offence and by making corporates too liable under the Act, the new law attempts to deal with the supply side of corruption. It thus accords with the UN convention on the subject. Trials must be conducted within a time frame, a judicial reform which could be extended to other areas as well, because swift and certain punishments are a sine qua non for deterrence against crime.
These amendments, however, hardly go to the root of the problem: In the face of entrenched vested interests, corruption cannot just be legislated away. Anthropologists and political scientists have for long been pointing out that it is also a cultural phenomenon. Kaushik Basu in his latest book, the Republic of Beliefs, argues that in many contemporary societies a belief exists that corruption is acceptable as a way of life.
Apart from legislative measures, it would make sense for any government to focus much more sharply on reducing discretionary controls and other opportunities for abuse of power, simplifying processes, promoting transparency, and improving the ease of doing business. Also, most importantly, organisations, both public as well as private, must demand much greater accountability from their boards, audit committees and auditors.
In the long run, however, economic development remains India’s best bet. Half the variation in levels of corruption across the globe, points out the World Development Report 2017, is explained by levels of development: as a country progresses economically, the demand for honesty, both as a factor of production as well as a consumer good, rises and over a period of time creates its own supply. Any person who breaks the chain of trust suffers stigmatisation and isolation. Secondly, development also creates a new aspiring middle class which has historically provided an impetus to demands for meritocracy and clean government in many countries.
Some evidence of both these trends can be seen currently in our country. As a result, India’s ranking in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index has, between 2012 and 2017, slowly improved from 94 to 81. The country should now aim to break into the top fifty of these rankings.

The outlook remains neutral for ICICI Bank (₹319.4). We expect the stock to move in the ₹260-360 range in the medium term. The stock finds an immediate support at ₹298 and resistance at ₹345. A close above the latter could propel ICICI Bank to ₹410. But if it dips below ₹298, it can head towards ₹262.
F&O pointers: ICICI Bank October futures added a healthy open interest on Friday. It added almost 45.23 lakh shares. Option trading indicates that the stock could move in a range of ₹280-340.
Events: The private bank will declare its Q2 results on October 26, while this month’s contracts will expire on October 25.
Strategy: Traders could consider a short strangle on ICICI Bank. This can be initiated by selling ₹350-strike call and ₹270-put. They closed with a premium of ₹1.40 and ₹0.90, respectively.
That means, traders will receive ₹6,462.5, which is the maximum profit one can earn from this strategy. For that to happen, ICICI Bank has to settle between the strike price — between ₹270 and ₹350 — at the time of expiry.
However, loss potentials will be very high if ICICI Bank moves either up or down.
So, this strategy is strictly for traders who can take high risks and have deep pockets to weather volatility.
We advise traders to exit the position if the loss mounts to ₹5,000. Hold the position till expiry.

 ICICI Bank on Tuesday said the RBI has approved Sandeep Bakshi’s appointment as Managing Director and CEO of the bank for three years.
 After resignation of Chanda Kochhar, who was facing inquiry, earlier this month, the bank’s board had elevated Chief Operating Officer (COO) Bakshi as the new managing director and CEO for five years until October 3, 2023, subject to regulatory and other approvals.
 “We wish to inform you that RBI vide its letter no DBR Appt. No. 3065 /08.88.001/2018-19 dated October 15, 2018 has approved the appointment of Sandeep Bakhshi as Managing Director and CEO of the Bank for a period of three years with effect from October 15, 2018,” ICICI Bank said in a BSE filing.
 The private sector lender said Bakshi had joined the group in 1986.
 He was appointed as the MD and CEO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company on August 1, 2010 where under his leadership the company redesigned various products, re-engineered the distribution architecture and made significant improvement in productivity. He successfully led the listing of the company.
 Facing enquiry over the charges of nepotism and conflict of interest, ICICI Bank’s former MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar had quit the bank on October 4, six months before her current tenure was to end.
 Kochhar, 57, also resigned from all subsidiaries of the bank, including ICICI Securities where she had sought reappointment as the chairperson."

 Adopting a seemingly cautious approach, the Reserve Bank has approved appointment of Sandeep Bakhshi as ICICI Bank’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer for three years as against a five-year term sought by the lender.
 ICICI Bank on Tuesday informed the stock exchanges that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cleared Bakhshi’s appointment for three years effective from October 15.
 After ICICI group veteran Chanda Kochhar—who was facing inquiry related to alleged nepotism and quid pro quo in extending loans to certain entities—resigned earlier this month, the bank announced appointment of Bakhshi as the MD and CEO for five years.
“We wish to inform you that RBI...(on October 15, 2018) has approved the appointment of Sandeep Bakhshi as Managing Director and CEO of the Bank for a period of three years with effect from October 15, 2018,” ICICI Bank said in a BSE filing.
 Bakhshi, who joined the ICICI group in 1986, was elevated from the post of Chief Operating Officer (COO) to MD and CEO of the bank after resignation of Kochhar on October 4. The bank’s board had decided that Bakhshi would have a tenure of five years until October 3, 2023. However, the proposed term has been cut to three years by the RBI.
Shares of ICICI Bank rose 2.5 per cent to close at Rs 321.05 on the BSE.
Bakhshi was appointed as the MD and CEO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company in August, 2010. Under his leadership, the company re-designed various products, re-engineered the distribution architecture and made significant improvement in productivity.
 Facing enquiry over the charges of nepotism and conflict of interest, Kochhar had quit the bank on October 4, six months before the end of her tenure. Kochhar, 57, had also resigned from all subsidiaries of the bank, including ICICI Securities.
In recent months, the RBI seem to be exercising a cautious approach when it comes to re-appointment of chiefs of private sector banks, especially against the backdrop of rising non-performing assets in the banking system.
In September, the RBI had curtailed the three-year term that the Yes Bank’s board had sought for Kapoor, also one of the promoters of the bank, to January 31, 2019, and asked the bank to find a replacement. The lender had sought a three-year extension till August 31, 2021 for Kapoor.
 In April, the Axis Bank board curtailed the fourth term of Sharma as MD and CEO to seven months following an unusual request from her that she be relieved on December 2018, 29 months ahead of the scheduled term. The board’s decision came against the backdrop of the RBI raising questions over her re-appointment in the wake of mounting non-performing assets."

The Reserve Bank of India, on Tuesday, approved the appointment of Sandeep Bakhshi as the Managing Director and CEO of ICICI Bank for a three-year term.
“The RBI … has approved the appointment of Sandeep Bakhshi as MD and CEO of the bank for a period of three years with effect from October 15, 2018,” the lender said in a regulatory filing. This is against the bank’s proposal for a five-year term for Bakhshi.
The board of directors of ICICI Bank had, on October 4, appointed Bakhshi as the new MD and CEO and had accepted the resignation of earlier chief Chanda Kochhar with immediate effect.
Sources, however, said the RBI approval for a three-year term is standard practice, and similar terms have been given to other bank chiefs also.
“Under Companies’ Act, the maximum term for a MD and CEO can be up to five years, which is what the board has recommended. With the RBI approval for a three-year term, the bank can seek a two-year extension later,” said a person familiar with the development.

In another blow to Chanda Kochhar, law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas has withdrawn its 2016 report, in which it had given a clean chit to the former ICICI Bank MD and CEO over allegations of nepotism and conflict of interest in the sanctioning of loans to the Videocon Group.
The law firm withdrew the report following recent developments, which forced Kochhar to step down. A complaint by a whistleblower prompted the private sector bank to launch a fresh probe on May 30, 2018.
“The bank informed the law firm about the said developments, whereupon the law firm expressed that its earlier report would no longer be valid,” ICICI Bank said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. 
“The law firm submitted its report in December 2016 stating that it had found no evidence of nepotism and conflict of interest on the part of Kochhar and accordingly the matter was treated as closed,” ICICI Bank said, adding that all concerned parties (including the bank) cooperated with the inquiry at the time.
The bank said its Chairman had engaged “a reputed law firm” to probe the allegations in 2016. A spokesperson for Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas declined to comment. 
Sources said the fresh internal inquiry, being led by retired Supreme Court Judge Justice BN Srikrishna, is likely to be completed by end-November.
Face-saving tactic
“The scope of the probe has widened, so the law firm felt it should withdraw its report,” said a source familiar with the development, and added that it may be a face-saving tactic by the firm in case Kochhar is found to be at fault.

Private sector lender ICICI Bank on Friday reported a near 56 per cent decline in its second quarter net profit, but managed to return to black after posting a loss in the first quarter of this fiscal.
ICICI Bank reported a net profit of ₹908.9 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, which was 55.8 per cent lower than the ₹2,058.2 crore it reported in Q2 FY18, due to elevated provisioning and a decline in other income. The bank had reported a ₹120-crore net loss in the first quarter of FY19.
However, its asset quality showed some improvement, with the gross additions to non-performing assets (NPAs), at ₹3,117 crore, being the lowest in the last 12 quarters.
The bank’s Q2 total income fell 2.67 per cent to ₹18,262.12 crore (₹18,763.29 crore). a year ago. Interest income grew a robust 12.41 per cent to ₹6,418 crore (₹5,709 crore).
However, other income fell 39.13 per cent to ₹3,156.49 crore (₹5,186.24 crore). The bank said other income in Q2 FY18 had included ₹1,711.32 crore from the sale of a stake in ICICI Lombard General Insurance.
The lender also reported a loss of ₹35 crore in its treasury income in the latest quarter, against a profit of ₹2,193 crore in the same period last fiscal. “Net interest margin was at 3.33 per cent, which was the highest in six quarters,” it said in a statement.
ICICI Bank’s gross NPAs rose to ₹54,488.96 crore, or 9.3 per cent of gross advances, as on September 30, 2018. It was 9.65 per cent as on June 30, 2018 and 8.79 per cent as on September 30, 2017. Its net NPAs showed a slight improvement at 4.05 per cent of net advances at the end of Q2 FY19, compared to 4.98 per cent in Q2 FY18.
The lender’s provisions remained elevated but fell by 11.3 per cent to ₹3,994.29 crore at the end of Q2.
ICICI Bank said the gross NPA additions in the second quarter included the impact of currency depreciation on existing foreign currency NPAs of ₹1,304 crore. Recoveries and upgrades from non-performing loans were ₹1,006 in the quarter under review. 
The bank’s board appointed Hari Mundra as an Independent Director for a period of five years.

99,2018-10-27,ICICI,"ICICI’s core performance picks up, NPAs moderate 
 In private lenders such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, key concerns for investors have hung around asset quality – whether the NPA recognition cycle is bottoming out, or if there are still large slippages lurking around the corner. 
ICICI Bank’s performance in the latest September quarter offers some respite to investors, who have been wrestling with the bank’s lacklustre performance for three years.
A gradual pick-up in loan growth, decent growth in core net interest income, and moderation in slippages are key positives in ICICI Bank’s September quarter performance, and this should lend comfort to investors. 
That said, slippages are still above the levels seen prior to the December 2015 quarter, when bad loans started to rise sharply. Further moderation in slippages, sustainability of pick-up in loan growth, and the RBI’s divergence report on bad loans pertaining to FY18, will remain key factors to watch out for in the coming quarters. A significant re-rating in valuation will be unlikely in the near term, until there is more clarity on these trends and the bank’s earnings visibility.
ICICI Bank had reported sharp slippages of ₹15,737 crore in the March quarter. A chunk of it was due to the RBI’s new framework for stressed assets, which, in effect, did away with all the old restructuring schemes. Gross slippages in the June quarter remained elevated at about ₹4,000 crore.
 While the slippages have moderated notably to ₹3,117 crore in the September quarter, they are still above the bank’s quarterly additions to bad loans of ₹1,600-2,200 crore until the December 2015 quarter when the slippages first shot up. 
Hence, it may still be difficult to gauge whether the bank’s NPA recognition cycle has bottomed out. Importantly, the RBI’s annual risk-based assessment for FY18 is still awaited; any sharp divergence reported by the bank could be a setback.
Also, the bank’s watchlist (stressed assets pool) is still around ₹3,200 crore, which could slip into NPAs in the coming quarters.
While asset-quality trends still need watching, on the core performance front, the bank has witnessed a notable improvement. From single-digit last year, the bank’s credit growth has seen a steady rise over the past two to three quarters, thanks to strong show in the retail segment. In the latest September quarter, the bank’s credit grew by about 13 per cent y-o-y, driven by a 20 per cent growth in retail loans. 
However, the robust pace of growth in unsecured loans (though a lower share of the total retail loan portfolio) may need some watching. The bank’s unsecured loans have grown by a robust 42 per cent y-o-y in the September quarter, led by personal loans and credit cards.
Nonetheless, the bank’s 12 per cent growth in net interest income is an improvement over the 9 per cent growth in the June quarter, and 1 per cent growth in the March quarter. How well the bank is able to sustain this improvement in core performance will be critical for earnings.
That said, performance on the asset-quality front will remain the key driver for earnings and valuations for the bank in the coming quarters."

The bank had on Friday reported a bigger-than-expected 56 per cent fall in Q2 net profit, but its asset quality improved. It had posted September quarter net profit of Rs 909 crore ($123.75 million) compared with a loss in the June quarter.
Bad loan additions of Rs 3,117 crore in Q2 were down from Rs 4,036 crore in the June quarter. Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans fell to 8.54 per cent by September end from 8.81 per cent in the previous quarter.
Jefferies says ICICI remains one of its preferred stocks. The brokerage expects continued core pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) growth over the next 3-4 quarters as net interest margin starts expanding, loan growth picks up and asset quality normalises.

 ICICI Bank has chalked out aggressive plans to grow its retail loan portfolio in Tamil Nadu by over 40 per cent to Rs 13,000 crore during current financial year.
“The bank also set a target on consumer loans to grow by 50 per cent in financial year 2018-19 to Rs 5,000 crore,” ICICI Bank, Executive Director, Anup Bagchi told reporters here.
“There is a big opportunity for us to grow the loan book by 40 per cent (in Tamil Nadu). We are targeting to disburse Rs 13,000 crore in FY19,” he said.
 The company’s home loan disbursement is likely to grow by nearly 40 per cent to Rs 3,700 crore while agri-related loans by 30 per cent to Rs 4,300 crore during the current financial year, he added.
Bagchi also stated that the bank would increase the processing centres to 20 from the existing 15 in the state.
 Asked if banks would cut down on number of ATM machines, he said there was no such proposal to do so.
 The Confederation of ATM Industry (CATMi) recently warned that changes in the regulatory landscape were making it unviable to operate ATMs and may lead to the closure of half of the 2.38 lakh units present in the country by March 2019.
 Bagchi said the bank would also focus on affordable housing segment and expanding its presence in Tier II and III cities like Erode, Hosur, Karur, Thanjavur as it is a key driver for home loan portfolio.
“We plan to increase our home loan portfolio to Rs 3,700 crore in FY19. To drive this growth, we have adopted multi-pronged strategy - expanding presence tier II and III markets, focusing on affordable housing and credit processing centres,” he said.
 The bank has a wide retail network of branches across Tamil Nadu. “Over 60 per cent of our branches are located in the semi-urban and rural areas,” he said."
94,2018-11-28,ICICI,"ICICI Bank unveils strategy for future branches, ATMs
 
Leading private lender ICICI Bank has announced two key decisions pertaining to its future branches and ATM expansion.
First, it will expand and set up branches and ATMs wherever there is economic activity. Second, if the footfalls at its branches reduce due to digitisation, it will consider reducing the branch format from large to small.
However, it ruled out the possibilities of cutting down branches and ATMs because of growing digital transactions. At present, about 90 per cent of ICICI Bank’s transactions happen through the digital mode. “We don’t subscribe to the view of cutting down branches or ATMs on account of digitisation. But the nature of business is changing at the branch levels. They are shifting more towards advisory and complex transactions. Because easier transactions are getting done digitally as people don’t come to branches just to do cash or other simple transactions,” said Anup Bagchi, Executive Director, ICICI Bank.
The bank’s strategy will be to set up branches and ATMs wherever business activity emerges. “There are new pockets of activity, and our bank will be there to support,” he added.
Bagchi also highlighted that the bank may not require many large formats due to the drop in customers walking into its branches. “So, if we see footfalls coming down, we will cut the size of the branches,” he added. The bank has seen acceleration of digitisation due to the combined effects of demonetisation and implementation of GST. “There has been a three-fold growth in the bank’s credit flow to MSMEs,” he said.
“GST has made things easier for the bank and its customers. We can sanction credit easily and quickly, as we are now able to estimate revenues and other financial details of a customer. In pre-GST period, tax payments and other things were not clear,” he added.
Tamil Nadu holds a strong position in ICICI Bank’s growth. With 10 per cent of its branches (485 in the State) and ATMs (1,525), which is the largest network among the private sector banks in the State, Tamil Nadu has been bringing strong business to the bank.
During this fiscal, the bank aims to grow its retail loan disbursement in the State by more than 40 per cent to ₹13,000 crore, supported by growth in segments such as consumer, home loan, and allied agri loans.
It plans to grow consumer loans by nearly 50 per cent to ₹5,000 crore, while home loan disbursements are expected to grow by 40 per cent to ₹3,700 crore.
The bank also lends significantly to self-help groups (SHGs) in the State. It has cumulatively disbursed loans to over 1.3 lakh SHGs, benefiting more than 17 lakh women. By the end of FY20, it intends to expand its reach to 25 lakh women beneficiaries, with a cumulative loan disbursement of ₹7,000 crore. “Our SHG experience is very good in Tamil Nadu,” added Bagchi."

The independent enquiry panel under retired judge of the Supreme Court BN Srikrishna that is probing allegations of corporate misconduct and quid pro quo in a loan by former Managing Director and CEO of ICICI Bank Chanda Kochhar is still underway and its report is now likely in the New Year. 
“The investigation is still on. The report is likely to be submitted to ICICI Bank by January-end or February,” said a person familiar with the development.
The board of ICICI Bank had, on May 29, decided to institute an enquiry headed by an “independent and credible” person into allegations against Kochhar by an anonymous whistleblower. It had appointed Justice (Retd) BN Srikrishna to head the internal enquiry panel.
ICICI Bank Chairman GC Chaturvedi had, in August this year, said the report was likely in two- to two-and-a-half months’ time. 
Kochhar, who was on leave at the time, has since resigned and the lender’s Chief Operating Officer Sandeep Bakhshi has been appointed in her place. 
Meanwhile, ICICI Bank is also likely to appoint a forensic lender to look into allegations by a whistleblower of irregularities in 31 loan accounts.
This is a separate set of allegations raised by an anonymous whistleblower. ICICI Bank, in June, said a whistleblower had alleged irregularities in 31 borrower accounts, which had led to incorrect classification of assets, accounting of interest income and NPA recoveries as fees, and over-valuation of security for corporate loans.
The lender is understood to have already hired a law firm to investigate these allegations.
ICICI Bank did not respond to an e-mail questionnaire from BusinessLine. Srikrishna could not be reached for comment. Shares of ICICI Bank gained 0.80 per cent on Friday, closing at ₹352.10 apiece on the BSE."

Remaining bullish about the economy, private sector lender ICICI Bank expects GDP to grow by 7.2 per cent in 2018-19, and the Centre’s fiscal deficit to exceed the full-year target by 0.2 per cent to 0.3 per cent of the GDP.
The Centre has targeted the fiscal deficit at 3.3 per cent of the GDP, but the private sector bank believes that any marginal breach of the target will not be a significant cause for concern.
“We do not expect extra deficit to be financed through market borrowings. Other means of financing and some expenditure shifting or reduction would be resorted to,” said B Prasanna, Head, Global Markets Group, ICICI Bank.
According to Prasanna, the economy is likely to see marginal recovery next fiscal, and is likely to grow by 7.4 per cent in 2019-20. “Consumption demand will see some slowdown, but support will be provided by some ongoing recovery in investment demand,” he said, adding that there could be some pick-up in credit growth once the health of the banking sector improves.
Estimating inflation to average at 4 per cent in the first-half of next fiscal with a sharp pick-up in the second half, Prasanna said that the Monetary Policy Committee is likely to change its stance to ‘neutral’ from ‘calibrated tightening’ in February 2019.
“Prospects of a rate cut are now rising significantly and the probability of a cut by April is growing. We feel the MPC should remain on a long pause, given the upside risks towards the end of the fical year,” he said.
ICICI Bank also expect the rupee to strengthen towards 69 against the dollar by March 2019 and trade around 69-72 against the greenback in 2019-20."

Liberty House has sought more time to make upfront payments it had committed under the resolution plans for Adhunik Metaliks and Amtek Auto.




Casting doubts over the ability of Liberty House to meet its commitments under resolution plans for Adhunik Metaliks and Amtek Auto, the Committee of Creditors led by ICICI Bank is said to have rejected the resolution plan submitted by the London-based Group for debt-laden shipbuilder ABG Shipyard Ltd.
The committee of creditors is said to have rejected the resolution plan submitted by Liberty House for ABG Shipyard through an electronic voting on December 18 and recommended liquidation of the shipyard, a person briefed on the voting said, asking not to be named.
Liberty Group is looking to appeal the CoC decision in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), arguing that its bid was more than the liquidation value of Rs 2,200 crore set by the lenders, the person said.
Liberty has sought more time to make upfront payments it had committed under the resolution plans for Adhunik Metaliks and Amtek Auto.
“Lenders don’t trust Liberty anymore after it failed to honour the commitments made under resolution plans for Adhunik Metaliks and Amtek Auto”, the person said.
Sundaresh Bhat, the resolution professional for ABG Shipyard, did not respond to calls made to his mobile phone seeking comment.
The CoC’s decision to hold an electronic voting on the resolution plan submitted by Liberty and reject it comes ahead of a hearing of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on January 19 on the case.

In an interim order earlier, the NCLT had directed the resolution professional for ABG Shipyard to consider the bid placed by Liberty Group in the second round of bidding for the debt-laden shipbuilder.
The interim order of NCLT came on a petition brought by the London-based metals group seeking to overturn its disqualification from the second round of bidding for ABG Shipyard in April under Section 29 (a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
Liberty offered Rs 5,200 crore on a deferred payment basis stretching over 5-10 years. The bid also included an upfront amount of Rs 400 crore and issue of debentures.
The business plan submitted by Liberty includes completing the pending ship orders and then pursuing a combination of shipbuilding and ship-breaking business. It also includes setting up a steel rolling mill inside the yard to make steel using materials generated from dismantling of ships.
ABG Shipyard is among the list of 12 large companies that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had identified in June 2017 for banks to refer to the bankruptcy court.
The resolution of ABG Shipyard was to be completed by April 28 according to the timeline set by NCLT, which was set up to oversee the bankruptcy law aimed at fixing the country’s mounting bad bank loans. The timeline has since been extended.
The lenders have set a liquidation value of Rs 2,200 crore for the yard that owes some Rs 18,245 crore to a clutch of banks led by ICICI Bank.
Liberty Group led by Indian-born businessman Sanjeev Gupta was the only bidder for ABG in three rounds of bidding."

First, loans went kaput and borrowers left the country after defaulting on payments or committing frauds; then, high-profile bankers were forced to leave and even the top central banker quit in the end. 2018 was indeed a ‘year of exits’ for the banking sector.
In the meantime, the sector continued to sit on a mountain of non-performing assets (NPAs) even as efforts continued in courts and tribunals and other forums for the recovery of stressed assets, which was further confounded by defaulting promoters of corporates coming back to reclaim their assets when they were put on sale by aggrieved lenders.
The eventful year began with the lid being taken off from the country’s biggest-ever banking fraud. Billionaire diamantaire Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi, in connivance with certain bank officials, allegedly cheated state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) of about ₹14,000 crore through issuance of fraudulent letters of undertaking.
A Mumbai branch of PNB had fraudulently issued LoUs for the group of companies belonging to Modi since March 2011, and there were hundreds of such LoUs.
The magnitude of the scam shook the entire banking system and PNB is still trying to overcome the fallout.
As intricacies of the Nirav Modi scam were still unfolding, a whistle-blower in March raised an issue of impropriety against Chanda Kochhar, the then managing director of the country’s largest private sector lender ICICI Bank, which, for long, had been a showcase institution where nothing could go wrong.
Kochhar, 56, who rose through the ranks to occupy the corner office of the prestigious institution, was mired in allegations of conflict of interest, lack of disclosures, and quid pro quo while extending loans to the now-bankrupt Videocon Industries.

Subsequently, another complaint was filed against her and she had to eventually say goodbye to the bank that she had joined as a management trainee in 1984.
As regulatory and internal probes continued, the bank and Kochhar denied any wrongdoing.
Another high-profile banker Shikha Sharma was denied extension by the RBI as managing director of Axis Bank, the third-largest private sector lender. The bank’s board had proposed another three-year term for her till May 2021, but she was allowed to serve only till December 31, 2018.

Another exit story continues to play out at YES Bank, where Rana Kapoor’s tenure as CEO has been curtailed by the Reserve Bank of India, and he has been allowed to occupy the position only till January 31. The lender also saw Ashok Chawla quitting as its chairman last month.
However, the biggest of the exits took place at the RBI with Governor Urjit Patel announcing his sudden resignation with immediate effect on December 10 citing “personal reasons”. The resignation, however, followed a run-in with the government over several issues, including autonomy of the central bank. The very next day, the government appointed former bureaucrat Shaktikanta Das as the new RBI chief.
In case of both Axis Bank and YES Bank, the RBI had flagged problems with their assets. Axis Bank’s NPAs jumped over five-fold in two years till March 2017, while net profit halved in the same period. It saw its gross bad loans ratio rise to 5.04 per cent by March 2017, from 0.96 per cent in March 2009, when Sharma had taken charge.
Several lenders, including YES Bank, were asked by the RBI to disclose ‘divergences’ in their bad loan reporting. The central bank judged gross NPAs at ₹8,373.8 crore at YES Bank for 2016-17, against the declared gross NPAs of ₹2,018 crore.
As a promoter, Kapoor and his family own 10.66 per cent stake in the bank, which is now actively searching for his replacement as CEO.
In the public sector banking space, the fight continued against NPAs and the situation remains far from normal.
Gross NPAs peaked in March and have shown some moderation of nearly ₹23,860 crore in the first half of the current financial year (April-September 2018) to ₹8,71,741 crore. It stood at ₹8,95,601 crore as on March 2018.
Losses at public sector banks widened further to ₹4,532 crore in the quarter ended October 2018, from ₹4,285 crore in the same quarter a year ago, indicating pressure from NPAs on their bottomlines. Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar, however, pointed out that the record recovery of ₹67,026 crore in the first half of the current financial year, was more than double the amount recovered in the first half of the last fiscal and nearly the same as the ₹67,107 crore recovered during the whole of the preceding financial year.
He asserted that a significant recovery is expected, going forward, as a number of high-value accounts are at advanced stages of the resolution process in the National Company Law Tribunal.
During the year, the government also approved the stake-sale of IDBI Bank to LIC. As part of the consolidation process, the government also announced the merger of Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank to create a global-sized lender, which will be “stronger and sustainable”. With a combined business of ₹14.8 lakh crore, it will be the country’s third-largest bank after state-run SBI and private lender ICICI Bank."

Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
I brought ICICI Bank at ₹355 with a short-term view. Should I hold it or sell?
Shyam Somani
ICICI Bank (₹361): Following a strong fall in the first half of 2018, the stock of ICICI Bank found support at ₹260 in late July 2018. Taking support from the significant long-term support level of ₹260, the stock resumed its long-term uptrend that has been in place since the early 2016 low recorded at ₹164. 
From July, the stock has been on a medium-term uptrend. Moreover, the short-term trend is also up for the stock. But it encountered a key resistance at around ₹365 in early November and continues to test this barrier with a positive bias. The stock trades well above its 21- and 50-day moving averages. The indicators in the daily chart show mixed signs, while the weekly indicators hover in the positive territory, backing the trend. 
A conclusive break above the current resistance level of ₹365 will strengthen the uptrend and take the stock northwards to ₹380 and ₹400 in the medium term. On the other hand, a decisive fall below the key support at ₹335 will mar the short-term uptrend and drag the stock down to ₹320 and then to ₹305 in the medium term. A fall below the key support at ₹305 will alter the medium-term uptrend and pull the stock down to ₹280 and then to ₹260 levels.

Dilip Buildcon (₹420): The stock has been on an intermediate-term downtrend since the May high of ₹1,248. Within this downtrend, the stock has been range-bound between ₹380 and ₹500 since late October. A strong break above ₹500 can take the stock up to ₹600 and ₹650 in the medium term. But an emphatic break above ₹800 is needed to alter the downtrend and take it up to ₹900 and ₹1,000. A fall below the key base level of ₹400 can drag the stock down to ₹350 and ₹300. Consider averaging on a strong rally above ₹500 with a stop-loss at ₹400.

ICICI Bank has become the top arranger of bond issues for the period between April and December 2018.
According to data from Prime Database, the private sector bank helped Indian firms raise ₹95,856.10 crore through bonds and non-convertible debentures through 107 issues.
This was followed by Axis Bank, which helped India Inc raise ₹93,296.27 crore from such instruments through a total of 101 issues.
According to the data, Indian companies raised a total of ₹ 3.65 lakh crore from bonds and NCDs through 1,547 issues between April 1 and December 31 last year.
 Though bond issuances were seen to be comparatively lower in 2018, compared to 2017, it seems to have picked up in the latter part of the year.
According to a recent report by CARE Ratings, total issuances through the private placement route stood at ₹3.73 lakh crore during the period April-December 2018, compared with ₹4.60 lakh crore during the same period last year.
“While this is significantly lower, the positive development has been the quantum of issuances in December, which was ₹84,925 crore, the highest in a month this year,” it noted.
An ICICI Bank spokesperson said the lender expects the corporate bond market to continue to occupy centre-stage in the months ahead, on the back of regulatory reforms, product innovation, and investor flows.
“On the supply side, the regulatory framework is encouraging corporate borrowers to actively consider corporate bonds as part of their overall incremental debt funding. 
“On the demand side, we see investor demand to sustain for quasi-sovereign, public sector names, as well as for high-quality, non-financial credits from the private sector,” the spokesperson said while attributing the bank’s top position in the league table to client coverage, market consistency, and ability to execute size."

The CBI has registered an FIR against several entities and persons, including former ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon Group MD Venugopal Dhoot, for alleged irregularities in loans sanctioned in 2012.
The FIR also listed Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL), Videocon Industries Ltd (VIL), Deepak Kochhar-owned NuPower Renewables Ltd (NRL), and Supreme Energy, which was originally promoted by Dhoot.
The CBI on Thursday morning carried out search operations in the Mumbai and Aurangabad offices of the Videocon Group, Supreme Energy and NRL. Noting that various committees of ICICI Bank had sanctioned loans to Videocon group companies on different dates, the FIR has named former and current officials of ICICI Bank who were a part of these committees, including Sandeep Bakhshi, Zarin Daruwala, K Ramkumar, Sonjoy Chatterjee, NS Kannan, Rajiv Sabharwal, KV Kamath and Homi Khusrokhan.
As these loans turned into NPAs and caused losses to the bank to the tune of ₹1,730 crore, the role of these officials may also be investigated, it said.
The CBI had, in December 2017, registered a preliminary enquiry on allegations that ICICI Bank officials had, for a quid pro quo, sanctioned credit facilities of ₹3,250 crore to five Videocon group companies in violation of the Banking Regulation Act. It was alleged that Dhoot invested ₹64 crore in NRL through Supreme Energy and also transferred the company to Pinnacle Energy Trust, which is managed by Kochhar in a “circuitous route”, between 2010-12.
Controversial loans
In the course of the enquiry, the CBI found that the lender had sanctioned six loans to Videocon group companies between June 2009 and October 2011 totalling ₹1,875 crore. Chanda Kochhar was on the sanctioning panel of two loans — one for ₹300 crore to VIEL and another for ₹750 crore to VIL.
The FIR noted that a day after the loan was disbursed to VIEL in September 2009, Dhoot transferred ₹64 crore to NRL through Supreme. “This was the first major capital received by NRL to acquire its first power plant. Thus, Chanda Kochhar got illegal gratification through her husband from VIL/VN Dhoot for sanctioning a loan of ₹300 crore to VIEL,” said the complaint filed by DJ Bajpei, Inspector of Police, CBI, adding that the outcome of the preliminary enquiry prima facie reveals the commission of cognizable offences.
ICICI Bank had also sanctioned loans to Videocon group companies Sky Appliances, Techno Electronics and Applicomp India."

Chanda Kochhar Troubled times
   -  PTI


The New Year seems to have brought ICICI Bank into the news again for the wrong reason. The year 2018 witnessed two developments relating to two prominent leaders in the banking industry, Chanda Kochhar and Shikha Sharma. These unfortunate episodes raise questions that go beyond the life and times of the leaders in reference.
Why did the extra-ordinarily well paid business leaders resort to business practices that appear highly questionable? Is it symptomatic of the insatiable desire for wealth in our society today? Of the desire to get into the record books of the wealthiest Indians?
If Kochhar is proven guilty of the inappropriate loans that the bank is alleged to have made under her watch, does it mean that leaders of private banks should be considered as vulnerable to the lure of wealth as some of their public sector counterparts? What does that mean for those observers who have been advocating privatisation of beleaguered public sector banks as the panacea for all their maladies?
There is an unfortunate irony here. Both Kochhar and Sharma started and grew their careers at ICICI, an institution that has been an essential part of the development of not just the financial sector but that of the Indian economy as a whole.
The only development bank that was not entirely state owned, ICICI enjoyed a privileged place among the troika of institutions that it was a part of, the others being Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) and Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI).
IDBI bit the dust recently, saddled with the bad decisions of an inept leadership. IFCI, for long the sick man of this cohort, was made a part of Punjab National Bank. ICICI had a different lineage of leadership and history from IDBI and IFCI. Led by stalwarts like the late HT Parekh, it enjoyed no less a stature in the financial sector than State Bank of India (SBI).
ICICI pioneered many initiatives in India such as the first credit rating enterprise, the first over-the- counter stock exchange, the first independent venture capital company and so on. As the development bank that first converted itself into a commercial bank, it emerged as a challenger to the state-owned SBI that had been around for much longer as the Imperial Bank of India.
Its remarkable success was the result of an organisational ethos and leadership legacy that had been cultivated over many decades, in spite of the significant presence of the government on its board of directors and in spite of its having to serve as an instrument of public policy.
Raised in the high banking traditions of ICICI, both Kochhar and Sharma were remarkable business leaders. Kochhar was held up as a shining example of excellence in leadership among women. 
Although less visible than Kochhar, observers of the financial sector would know that Sharma’s rise in ICICI was no less meteoric until she eventually migrated as CEO of Axis Bank after she lost the leadership race at ICICI to Kochhar.
How did the ICICI throw up two leaders who irreparably damaged their own reputation and that of the storied institution that she led in the case of Kochhar? Is it possible that this mess was in the making at ICICI for much longer than we can all see? Will we ever get to know when this rot started? If it did not start under Kochhar’s leadership where will this trail of apparent malfeasance lead us to?
One is reminded of the thesis of an interesting book, aptly titled The Fish Rots from the Head, by Bob Garratt. The decay in an organisation starts at the very top. It must be as true for ICICI as it is for any other modern corporation that the responsibility for the rot has to be placed where it belongs: The board and the leadership team that set off the decline in standards.
Sleuths will investigate the financial transactions in question. And some more. Debates will rage about whether the officials at ICICI were culpable and to what extent. Punishments will probably be meted out to the deserving or to some unsuspecting scapegoats. But the reputation of the two leaders and the institution where they built their careers will have suffered an irreversible damage, no matter what the outcomes of the investigation are.
As with every other crisis this is perhaps as good a time as any for ICICI, starting with the very top, to ask itself where and when did the rot start. And what lessons can the bank learn from this sorry turn of events.

India’s 70th Republic Day was nothing less than memorable for 77-year-old Nambi Narayanan. The former aerospace engineer with the Indian Space Research Organisation, once falsely implicated in a fabricated espionage case a quarter of century ago, was honoured with one of the topmost civilian prizes in the country, Padma Bhushan. It was in September last year, the Supreme Court held that his was a “malicious persecution” and ordered the Kerala Government to pay him ₹50 lakh in compensation. 
Soon, a biopic on Narayanan, who once spearheaded ISRO’s cryogenic efforts, Rocketry: The Nambi Effect, directed by South Indian cine-star, R Madhavan, will be released. Needless to say, Madhavan will be donning the role of the engineer with the wavy white mane. 
Fear factor
Several private sector bankers are jittery over the turn of events this past week, when the CBI filed FIRs in the Chanda Kochhar case. The reason is not far to seek: private sector bankers could be treated as public servants and booked and investigated if the loans that they dished out turned bad!
Moreover, the CBI is spreading its net wide as the FIR has named a list of ICICI Bank board members who were part of the sanctioning committees for the loans that turned non-performing. With the present ICICI Bank CEO Sandeep Bakshi also named in the FIR, the ICICI Bank board now has to defend his continuation as well. Tough times to run a bank or be a banker!
Gung-ho over elections
Power Minister RK Singh was in a pleasant mood last week when he called for an informal interaction with journalists. 
The gossip session covered various topics, including the development that happened in his constituency and the political dynamic after the opposition’s ‘Mahagathbandhan’. 
Singh was clear that the opposition coming under one umbrella would not damage the ruling BJP-led NDA alliance. 
Confident of a win, he even called for meeting the journalists soon after the elections. But next time the meeting will be over litti-chokha, a delicacy popular in the cow belt and his home State, Bihar.
Japan whispers, China denies
A recent report in Japanese publication Nikkei Asian Review, stating that Chinese Premier Xi Jinping was planning to visit India in February to counter the aggressive trade and diplomatic policies of the US, caught the attention of the Indian media. While New Delhi ignored the report and did not respond to queries from journalists, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, two days after the publication of the story, completely denied it.
Questions like why a Japanese publication would write a wrong report on something that does not directly concern it do cross the mind, but it is remarkable that news reporting, too, is getting increasingly globalised and may end up making governments more accountable.
Forget me not
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had to suffer an embarrassing moment at the inaugural function of the Pravasi Bhartiya Divas in Varanasi last week. After greeting all senior politicians on stage, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, UP Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi, Chief Minister of Haryana Manohar Lal and Chief Minister of Uttarakhand Trivendra Singh Rawat, she returned to her seat only to quickly go back to the podium.
With an apologetic smile, Swaraj said that she had forgotten to greet the Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth, who was also the chief guest for the event. She went on to describe in detail the close ties Jugnauth, whose ancestors belonged to UP, and people of his country shared with India. Yogi, too, did his share in trying to mollify the Mauritian PM by repeatedly acknowledging his presence and praising the guest. Hope it did the job!

The CBI has levelled serious charges against ICICI Bank’s former CEO Chanda Kochhar in its latest FIR, filed after year-long investigations into a whistle-blower complaint. Its contention is that Kochhar is guilty of ‘criminal conspiracy, cheating and abuse of official position’ because she was the bank’s CEO and a member of its credit committee, when it sanctioned a term loan to Videocon International Electronics in 2009. It alleges that her husband’s firm received a cash infusion from the Videocon group immediately after the loan sanction. As these charges are of a far more serious nature than conflict-of-interest issues initially flagged in this case, this could mean an extended period of uncertainty for ICICI Bank’s shareholders. CBI charges also underline the folly of ICICI Bank board’s actions, in rushing to stand behind its CEO and absolve her of all wrong-doing, as soon as the complaint came to light last year. It remains to be seen if the CBI, given its patchy record, furnishes adequate proof to make these charges stick, though it does appear to be indulging in ‘investigative adventurism’ in blaming the bank’s entire credit committee for loans that later turned into NPAs. 
It is certainly not bracing for domestic investors to see yet another marquee name from India Inc embroiled in a governance controversy. In the last couple of years, Axis Bank and YES Bank have been in the dock for chronically under-reporting NPAs. The unlisted IL&FS has blown up in a spectacular fashion, with glaring process and accounting gaps coming to light after supersession of its board. Sun Pharma is presently fending off whistle-blower complaints on related-party deals. The NSE itself is being investigated for preferential access to select market players. Apart from causing direct destruction of wealth for investors, the frequency of such episodes dents the credibility and confidence of stakeholders in India’s corporate governance superstructure. 
It is a pity that domestic companies should throw up so many instances of mis-governance when there are multiple built-in mechanisms to protect investors — from board scrutiny of operations and management, to internal and external audits, to a battery of public disclosures, and oversight by the RBI, SEBI and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Corporate boards have clearly stumbled in their stewardship duties to shareholders, in failing to ask hard questions of the incumbent management and letting the guilty bail out when the going got tough. SEBI and the Centre need to look beyond numerically large boards to demand greater accountability from the individual board members. The significant role that third-party whistle-blowers have played in blowing the lid off these scandals also needs to be recognised. There’s a crying need for SEBI to immediately acknowledge whistle-blower complaints and commit to a specific timeline on establishing their veracity, to avoid prolonged uncertainty for investors. Watertight laws that protect public and private whistle-blowers from persecution are critical too, but Indian laws fall quite short on this score."

 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)on Sunday has transferred the investigating officer in the ICICI Bank case as its “discreet inquiry” suggested his role in leaking information related to searches.
Superintendent of Police Sudhanshu Dhar Mishra was transferred to Ranchi, a day after filing an FIR in the case against former ICICI Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon Group Managing Director (MD) Venugopal Dhoot on January 22, they said.
The agency had carried out searches at multiple locations after the charge of the case was given to new investigating officer Mohit Gupta, they said.
Justifying the transfer, the CBI pinned the blame on Mishra for keeping the preliminary enquiry pending without any reasons, they said.
The CBI did not issue any formal statement in this regard.
“ICICI Bank case is one of the very important cases that was pending without progress,” one of the officials said.
The official said after review some time ago, the preliminary enquiry wad sped up and was converted into a regular case.
Immediately after the registration of the case, the searches were proposed to be conducted, they said.
“However, it was suspected that there was a possibility of information regarding searches being leaked,” the official claimed.
“A discreet inquiry was conducted and role of Sudhanshu Dhar Mishra was strongly suspected. Hence he has been transferred pending detailed inquiry in the matter, being serious,” he said.
The officials alleged role of Mishra and others, if any, in “keeping the PE pending” is also being looked into.
Meanwhile, the agency did not respond to question if Mishra was suspected of leaking the information why was he allowed to file the FIR when agency knew that he was delaying the preliminary enquiry.
The agency also did not respond to question which officer had cleared the FIR.
The agency had carried out searches at the offices of Videocon Group in Mumbai and Nupower Renewables and Supreme Powers, both controlled by Chanda Kochhar’s husband, on January 24.
It is alleged that during the tenure of Chanda Kochhar six loans worth Rs 1,875 crore were cleared for Videocon Group and its associated companies in which in two cases she herself was on the sanctioning committees.
In its FIR, the CBI has also named several top honchos of banking industry including the present CEO of ICICI Bank Sandeep Baxi alleging that they were also members of the sanctioning committees whose role needs investigation.
Banking doyen and Chairman of New Development Bank K V Kamath, Goldman Sachs India chairman Sonjoy Chatterjee, Standard Chartered Bank CEO Zarin Daruwala, Tata Capital head Rajiv Sabharwal and Tata Capital senior advisor Homi Khusrokhan need to be investigated, according to the FIR.
Their names were included by the agency in the text of the FIR after a year-long preliminary enquiry.
The action attract strong comments from former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley who advised the agency against “adventurism“.
“Sitting thousands of kilometres away, when I read the list of potential targets in the ICICI case, the thought that crossed my mind was again the same - instead of focusing primarily on the target, is a journey to nowhere (or everywhere) being undertaken? If we include the entire who’s who of the banking industry — with or without evidence — what cause are we serving or actually hurting.” 
Jaitley, who was finance minister of India till last week and had to temporarily hand over the charge to his fellow minister Piyush Goyal for the duration of his indisposition, advised the investigators — “Follow the advice of Arjun in the Mahabharat — Just concentrate on the bull’s eye.”"

Chanda Kochhar Troubled times
   -  PTI


There’s more trouble brewing for former ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar. The BN Srikrishna enquiry committee, set up by the bank, has said she violated the lender’s code of conduct and framework on conflict of interest. The committee has also flagged the lack of disclosures on her part, which made the bank’s processes ineffective.
Following the findings of the committee, the board has decided to treat her resignation as a termination and revoked all her existing and future entitlements. Kochhar had taken an early retirement last October.
The board has also decided to claw back bonuses paid to her from April 2009 to March 2018. Per information in the annual reports from FY10 to FY18, Kochhar was paid a performance bonus of about ₹9.8 crore over this period.
“Primarily on account of ineffectively dealing with conflict of interest and due disclosure or recusal requirements, Chanda Kochhar was in violation of the ICICI Bank Code of Conduct, its framework for dealing with conflict of interest and fiduciary duties, and in terms of applicable Indian laws, rules and regulations,” said the report by the internal enquiry committee under former Supreme Court judge BN Srikrishna.
The committee was set up by ICICI Bank last June to look into allegations against Kochhar by an anonymous whistleblower.
In a statement, Kochhar expressed shock and said the report has not been shared with her. “I reiterate that none of the credit decisions at the bank are unilateral. ICICI is an institution with established robust processes and systems which involve committee-based collective decision making with several professionals of high calibre participating in the decision making. Hence the organisation design and structure obviate the possibility of conflict of interest,” she said.
According to the probe report: “...the Bank’s processes were dependent solely on the directors discharging their fiduciary duty to recuse themselves and avoid conflict... the Bank’s processes were rendered ineffective by her approach to such disclosures and avoidance of conflict.”
The report, on Kochhar’s stint between April 1, 2009 and March 31, 2018, was taken up by the board on Wednesday. “The Bank notes there are no implications of the Enquiry Report on its published financial statements (Indian or US GAAP) for the relevant periods,” the bank said in a regulatory filing.








 
The report and consequent decisions by the board come days after the CBI filed an FIR against Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kocchar and Venugopal Dhoot, MD, Videocon Group, for alleged quid pro quo and misconduct in loans sanctioned in 2012 to the Videocon Group.
The FIR had also said investigations may be initiated against former and current officials of ICICI Bank who were part of the sanctioning committees. They include Sandeep Bakhshi, Zarin Daruwala, K Ramkumar, Sonjoy Chatterjee, NS Kannan, Rajiv Sabharwal, KV Kamath and Homi Khusrokhan."

Private sector lender ICICI Bank net profit fell 2.74 per cent during the third quarter of the fiscal with higher provisions despite a strong growth in net interest income.
Its net profit stood at ₹1,604.91 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 as compared to ₹1,650.24 crore in the third quarter last fiscal. However, on a sequential basis, its net profit has shown a marked improvement from ₹908.88 crore in the second quarter this fiscal and a loss of ₹120 crore in the first quarter.
Its total income rose 19.78 per cent in December quarter to ₹20,163.25 crore from ₹16,832.22 crore a year ago.








 
Net interest income increased by 21 per cent to ₹6,875 crore in the quarter under review from ₹5,705 crore a year ago.
Its net interest margin also improved to 3.4 per cent in the third quarter of the fiscal from 3.33 per cent in the second quarter.
Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, was ₹3,404 crore during the quarter compared to ₹3,101 crore. Provisions rose 18.9 per cent to ₹4,244 crore from ₹3,570 crore.
“The provision coverage ratio on non-performing loans, including cumulative technical/prudential write-offs, increased by 690 basis points sequentially to 76.3 per cent at December 31, 2018, further strengthening the balance sheet,” ICICI Bank said.
However, its gross non-performing assets remained high at 8.54 per cent of gross advances as on December 31, 2018 compared to 9.3 per cent on September 30, 2018 and 8.55 per cent on December 31, 2017.
ICICI Bank, however, said that gross NPA additions were the lowest in last 14 quarters at ₹2,091 crore in the quarter under review.
Net NPAs were, however, lower at 2.87 per cent of net advances as on December 31, 2018 compared to 4.64 per cent a year ago. Recoveries, upgrades and resolution of non-performing loans through sale were ₹4,063 crore in the period, including ₹720 crore on account of the impact of rupee appreciation on existing foreign currency NPAs.

70,2019-01-31,ICICI,"ICICI Bank shares rise on board decision to revoke ex-CEO Kochhar’s bonuses
 Shares of ICICI Bank Ltd gained nearly 3 per cent on Thursday, a day after the private sector lender posted an improvement in asset quality and an investigation found former Chief Executive Chanda Kochhar had violated internal bank policies.
The board has decided to “claw back” all bonuses paid to Kochhar between April 2009 until March 2018, following the conclusion of investigation led by former Supreme Court judge BN Srikrishna. Kochhar said she was “utterly disappointed, hurt and shocked by the decision.”
But investors welcomed the news, with shares rising as much as 2.9 per cent to a more than one-week high of Rs 376.65 in heavy trade. Nearly 32.6 million shares had changed hands by 0437 GMT, compared with the 30-day average of 15.8 million.
Shares of the country's third-largest private sector lender by market value were last up 1 per cent at Rs 369.95 .
Analysts at Jefferies said they fear legal options being pressed from both sides, pulling in both current and past executives, and which at best would be a “nuisance and noise”.
At least four brokerages raised their target price on the stock, though the lender posted a fall in third-quarter profit on Wednesday. Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans, a measure of asset quality, fell to 7.75 per cent at the end of December, from 8.54 per cent in the previous quarter and 7.82 per cent a year earlier. ICICI Bank, however, accounts for a chunk of the country's bad loans. 
ICICI Bank “continues to show promise with trending lower new NPL formation, and balance sheet growth with higher granularity on both asset and liability side,” Jefferies analysts wrote in a note. The brokerage raised its target price to Rs 450 from Rs 385, while HSBC hiked it to Rs 415 from Rs 400.
Credit Suisse analysts said the asset quality trends further reinforced the view of credit cycle turning."

68,2019-01-31,ICICI,"Sacking of Chanda Kochhar
This refers to ‘Guilty Chanda Kochhar sacked by ICICI Bank’ (January 31). Once the CBI registered a case of conflict of interest against Chanda Kochhar, she should have gracefully resigned from the post. Instead she stuck on and appears to have engineered a move to get a clean chit from the board. Now one can say that advocating privatisation of public sector banks is not a panacea for all their maladies.
It may not be out of place to mention that Shika Sharma of Axis Bank and Chanda Kochhar, along with their mentor KV Kamath, were in the thick of action when an important decision to close down/extinguish development financial institutions such as ICICI, IDBI and IFCI were taken.
If at all there is a single factor for the present predicament of stressed loans and non-performing assets in banks, it is this unwise idea of closing down DFIs in the late 1990s.
In a financial institution, integrity matters more than intelligence. Notwithstanding the business contributions made by Chanda Kochhar, she erred in considering the loan despite there being a conflict of interest. It is quite surprising how statutory central auditors, internal auditors and even the board ignored this aspect.

Numbers game
Our singular fixation with fiscal deficit needs to be tackled with transparent acquisition of debt to fund progress. Economies with diverse mix of debt, inflation and growth vis-a-vis debt/GDP ratios show that the issue lies more in the denominator than numerator. Benefits would lie in tackling lag in infrastructure growth and the adverse throwback from demonetisation and GST. Inflation, nominal interest rate and the stock market are now fairly healthy and the markets would look for more government debt till interest and inflation rates shoot up or stocks plunge. The need in this phase of rising unemployment is for sourcing fresh funds and taking care that they are used for pushing growth and not for meeting revenue expenditure.
R Narayanan
Navi Mumbai
The sacking of Chanda Kochhar is a bold decision taken by ICICI Bank. The responsibility should, however, be shared by the board of the bank, which kept quiet on the whistle-blower's complaint for over one year and gave her a clean chit less than a year ago. The fact that she headed the bank for nearly a decade must have contributed to this.
The regulator should ensure that private sector bank chiefs do not serve for more than five to six years in a single spell.
Recent experience at Axis Bank and YES Bank also point to the fact that long tenures as bank CEOs do more harm than good.

It was comforting to hear the special CBI court sentence National Democratic Front of Bodoland chief Ranjan Daimary and nine others to life imprisonment. Finally, after a long waiting of 10 years, justice has prevailed for the victims of the heart-wrenching blasts that took place on October 30, 2008. In this incident at least 11 bombs went off almost simultaneously in Guwahati and in Bongaigaon, Barpeta and Kokrajhar.
The incident left 81 people dead and 470 others injured. Such decisions by courts increase our faith in the judiciary.

Exodus of rural youth
In the final Budget of the incumbent NDA government, every segment of society will have some expectations or the other. The agriculture sector, for instance, has been promised measures that will double farmers’ income by 2022. But of larger concern is the exodus of rural youth towards urban destinations in search of employment. Farmers, especially the small and medium ones, are largely dependent on manual labour for tilling as mechanisation is not affordable for most of them. Emphasis must be given on retaining youth in the agriculture sector, else it would result in a drastic fall in farm productivity.

67,2019-01-31,ICICI,"Lesson for India Inc: ‘Any allegation must be taken seriously and quickly’ 
 
Was ICICI Bank’s board too hasty initially in giving a clean chit to its former Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar, or should she have made more disclosures?
These are the two issues being debated a day after the BN Srikrishna enquiry report said Kochhar had violated the bank’s code of conduct and framework on conflict of interest and that her lack of disclosures made the bank’s processes ineffective.
“It is easy to say that the bank should have done more, but it is not clear what they could have done differently. For instance, here the bank is saying that a process has been put in place, but is helpless since it was being wilfully ignored. And so, it cannot be seen as a systematic issue,” said Amit Tandon, founder and Managing Director of corporate governance and proxy advisory services, IiAS.
Most experts believe that the clean chit given by the board of ICICI Bank, led by then Non-Executive Chairman MK Sharma in March, last year, was based on the information available at that time and the 2016 report, which was later withdrawn by the law firm.
It was only in May last year that the board decided to start an independent investigation into the allegations made by an anonymous whistleblower. “The lesson for India Inc is that any allegation needs to be taken seriously and quickly as time is key in investigations. Also, boards should ensure they are seen as independent because their primary responsibility is to the shareholders,” said Tarun Bhatia, Managing Director and Head South Asia, Kroll.
Analysts believe that the report, along with the board terminating Kochhar’s appointment, could mean a clear break for the beleaguered private sector lender, which has been battling allegations about her since last year.
“I would think the chapter is now closed, but it is hard to predict. It did impact the bank’s share price initially, but with good earnings and performance, investors are now focussing on other parameters,” said an analyst, who did not wish to be named.
On Thursday, the ICICI Bank scrip, after initial gains in the morning, closed with a loss of 0.27 per cent at ₹364.25 apiece on the BSE."

Global rating agency Standard and Poor’s (S&P) said the developments around former ICICI Bank Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar and the board’s changing stance raises serious governance problems in the country’s banking sector.
“The recent developments surrounding former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar and the changing view of the bank's board of directors affirms our view of generally weak governance and transparency in the Indian banking sector,” it said on Friday.
The comments come days after the private sector lender sacked Kochhar based on the BN Srikrishna enquiry report which found her guilty of violating the bank’s code of conduct and making inadequate disclosures.
Meanwhile, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has also filed a first information report (FIR) against Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kocchar and Venugopal Dhoot, MD, Videocon Group for alleged quid pro quo and misconduct in loans sanctioned in 2012 to the Videocon Group.
Noting that the Board had in 2016 and in early 2018 given its full support to Kochhar, S&P said, “The Board's reversal of its previous strident support of Kochhar is significant in our view, and will likely result in Boards across the sector being more careful in giving clean chits to key management personnel facing allegations.”
It, however, said that the Board's ability and willingness to claw back bonuses and other benefits when a person is deemed to be at fault is an important check that supports accountability and good stewardship of companies.
S&P also noted that it is unclear if ICICI Bank would face any legal or financial risk due to this episode. More clarity on this matter is likely in the next few months.
“We note that there is limited public information on ICICI and CBI's findings, and the results are not judicial,”it added."

Dhoot had allegedly invested in Deepak Kochhar’s company Nupower through his firm Supreme Energy a quid pro quo to loans cleared by ICICI Bank after Chanda Kochhar took over as the CEO


 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered a criminal case of money laundering against former ICICI Bank Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar, Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot and others to probe alleged irregularities and corrupt practices in sanctioning of ₹1,875-crore loans by the bank to the corporate group, officials said Saturday.
They said the central probe agency filed an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, taking cognisance of a CBI complaint filed on the matter last month.
An ECIR is the ED’s equivalent of a police FIR.
The officials said the agency would probe if alleged kickbacks generated in the loan deal were laundered to create tainted assets.
The ED is soon expected to summon the accused named in the ECIR. The list of accused in the ED case is the same as that of the CBI, they said.
The CBI had named Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar, and Dhoot and his companies -- Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL) and Videocon Industries Limited (VIL). It also named Supreme Energy, a company founded by Dhoot, and Nupower Renewables, a company controlled by Deepak Kochhar, in the FIR.
The CBI has slapped sections of the Indian Penal Code related to criminal conspiracy, cheating and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act on all the accused.
It had also conducted raids in the case.
It is alleged that Dhoot had invested in Deepak Kochhar’s company Nupower through his firm Supreme Energy a quid pro quo to loans cleared by ICICI Bank after Chanda Kochhar took over as the CEO of the bank on May 1, 2009.
The ownership of Nupower and Supreme Energy changed hands through a complex web of shared transactions between Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot, the CBI alleged. 
During its preliminary enquiry, the CBI found that six loans worth ₹1,875 crore were sanctioned to the Videocon Group and companies associated with it between June, 2009 and October, 2011 in alleged violation of laid-down policies of ICICI Bank, which have now become part of the probe.
“Existing outstanding in the accounts of these private group companies were adjusted in Rupee Term Loan of ₹1,730 crore sanctioned by ICICI Bank under refinance of domestic debt under consortium arrangement on April 26, 2012,” a CBI spokesperson had said.
The loans were declared non-performing assets in 2012, causing a loss of ₹1,730 crore to the bank, it alleged."

B Prasanna, Group Executive and Head - Global Markets Group, ICICI Bank




B Prasanna, Group Executive and Head - Global Markets Group, ICICI Bank




Ahead of the monetary policy review, B Prasanna, Group Executive and Head - Global Markets Group, ICICI Bank, believes India is in a sweet spot because of the fall in oil prices and improvement in current account deficit (CAD). Pegging GDP growth at 7.4 per cent for FY20, he says the view on rate cuts seems to be quite benign at present. In an interview with BusinessLine, he also shares his outlook for the year. Excerpts:
What is your expectation for the global economy this year?
Last year was a bad one for emerging markets and a good one for dollar asset classes as compared to 2017. 
I think 2019 will evolve like 2017 for emerging market asset classes, as what primarily broke their back in 2018 was the performance of the dollar and dollar interest rates. But, after October 2018, oil fell and this improved at one shot the biggest macro problem for countries with a CAD problem. 
The US will slow down along with all the other developed countries. If the trade war doesn’t flare up too much, emerging markets will grow reasonably well.
India is in a sweet spot because of the oil fall and improvement in CAD, fiscal deficit remains a concern but broadly the parameters have improved a lot.
The CSO’s advance estimates peg GDP growth at 7.2 per cent this fiscal but the PMI has been moderating. What is the reason for this divergence?
The question is how high frequency indicators are performing. Some segments of the services sector are doing well and some segments of the manufacturing sector like auto are not doing well. 
There has been a gradual downgrade of GDP estimates for the current year, not just by the government but also by most analysts. For example, we started off with an estimate of 7.5 per cent, which was lowered to 7.4 per cent and now our projection is at 7.2 per cent. 
As we said in our annual outlook, consumption is slowing down, investment has picked up but not private investment. So, investment growth is due to government spending. We expect GDP growth at 7.4 per cent next fiscal.
What is your expectation on a rate cut by the RBI?
There has been a dramatic increase in fears of a slowdown in the US economy over the past one-and-a-half months. This is because 2018 was an above-trend year driven by a push by fiscal factors. The feeling is that the US Fed will slow down its rate hikes and will also cease to tighten its balance sheet compared to what they had originally planned. 
From an RBI rate perspective, I think the view is quite benign as oil is low and inflation has softened on a realised basis. We expect inflation to go up in the second half this year, but the space for a rate-cut has opened up. Though our house call is for a pause for the rest of the year, many market participants have started anticipating some rate cuts.
Do you expect further volatility in the rupee?
I expect the rupee to be in a range of 69-72 against the US dollar. We saw 74-74.5 last year but that is not something we might visit this year hopefully. This is because oil prices are low and on top of the reduction in CAD, there is also some expectation that FPIs might put in money this year as emerging markets will do well. So, equity and debt inflows will come in and currency will be stable. The depreciation of the rupee will broadly be determined by the inflation deferential of 2-2.5 per cent per annum."

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das




RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das


In its first comments on the Chanda Kochhar affair involving allegations impropriety while heading ICICI Bank, the Reserve Bank on Thursday said it is for the law enforcement agencies to take an action in the case.
The role of the regulator is limited to looking at the violations of its regulations by individuals or groups, and act on the same, governor Shaktikanta Das said.
“If there are certain things which require investigation, that is in the domain of the investigating agencies and it’s for them to take further action,” he told reporters during the customary post-policy press conference.
He was replying to a specific question on how the banking regulator looks at the developments at the ICICI Bank, where an independent enquiry constituted by the lender has found Kochhar guilty of misconduct.
A few days before her virtual expulsion, the CBI filed an FIR naming Kochhar and others in the alleged quid pro quo in extending a ₹ 3,250-crore loan to the Videocon Group.
Amid raging controversy over the case, Kochhar - also a Padma Bhushan awardee and the first woman to head a bank in the country way back in 2009--quit the bank in October 2018 months after the lender had given a clean chit to her.
The independent probe panel headed by retired Supreme Court judge BN Srikrishna has observed that Kochhar violated bank policies and other rules and regulations.
There were allegations of involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to the Videocon group on a quid pro quo basis. It was alleged that the Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm now owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar.
The allegation of conflict of interest was levelled by whistle blower Arvind Gupta.
Interestingly, there are media reports saying the RBI had given her a clean chit in 2016 itself, when the allegations first surfaced.
Following the Srikrishna panel report, the bank said it would not treat her leaving the bank as retirement but a termination of her service and also decided to claw back around ₹ 10 crore bonus paid to her between 2009 and March 2018 along with blocking her close to ₹ 340 crore of ESOPs - both a first in the country. She is reportedly planning a legal challenge to both punitive actions."

Former ICICI Bank Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar is understood to be exploring various legal options following termination of her service by the private sector lender and investigations by government agencies.
According to sources familiar with the development, Kochhar, who is in Mumbai, has been meeting lawyers for a second opinion.
“She has her own legal team, but she is also meeting other experts to get a second opinion,” said a person familiar with the development, adding that she met lawyer Abha Singh recently. Kochhar was unavailable for comment.
“She is fully cooperating with the investigating agencies at present, so there is no requirement for legal recourse as of now. As and when it is required, the issue will be taken up,” said a person familiar with the development.
On being contacted, Singh said: “In my personal opinion, if IAS officers in Maharashtra have been protected because Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act has been removed, then why not bankers? Where is the criminality? The criminality is yet to be proven. And no loan is given by one person individually.” The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered an FIR against several entities and persons, including Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar, and Videocon Group MD Venugopal Dhoot, for alleged irregularities in loans sanctioned in 2012. The allegations are also under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate and market regulator SEBI. 
Kochhar, who had resigned in October last year, was sacked by ICICI Bank in January this year, after an internal probe by former Supreme Court Judge BN Srikrishna said she had violated the bank’s code of conduct and framework on conflict of interest and that her lack of disclosures made the bank’s processes ineffective."

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) rejected ICICI Bank’s plea to initiate insolvency proceedings against Era Infrastructure (India) Ltd on the grounds of “duplicacy” of claims on Sunday.
A two-member bench headed by NCLT President Justice M M Kumar observed that ICICI Bank has already raised similar claims against its parent company Era Infra Engineering, which is currently undergoing resolution process.
The tribunal held that “on account of duplicacy” of the claims, the petition filed by ICICI Bank cannot be entertained.
“This is again raised for admission in the present proceeding. Such a course obviously is not permissible in law,” it said.
The tribunal observed that the application filed by ICICI Bank to initiate insolvency proceedings against Era Infrastructure was based on the same sets of facts and documents which the resolution professional (RP) of Era Infra Engineering had earlier rejected.
Later, NCLT had on December 6, 2018 directed the RP of Era Infra Engineering to admit the said claims as financial debt of the company.
Era Infra Engineering was in the first list of 12 defaulting companies which was issued by Reserve Bank of India, directing banks to recover debts through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (IBC) Code.
ICICI Bank had given a loan of Rs 240 crore to Era Infrastructure India. For the loan, its parent firm Era Infra Engineering had guaranteed the payments, which were later defaulted on.
Meanwhile, corporate insolvency was initiated against the parent firm Era Infra Engineering by NCLT and its RP had invited claims.
ICICI Bank had lodged its claim before the RP placing reliance on securities and contractual comfort provided by Era Infra Engineering towards the entities and group companies related to it.
However, the RP had rejected its claims on September 13, following which ICIC Bank approached the NCLT. The tribunal had admitted ICICI Bank’s plea on December 6, 2018 and had directed RP to admit the claims."

ICICI Bank had sanctioned a Rupee Term Facility of ₹165 crore on the execution of a Credit Agreement Letter (CAL) in December 2009 to enable Marg finance up to 50 per cent contribution in the business plan to establish Karaikal Port Pvt Ltd in Puducherry by equity participation and capital expenditure.
The Rupee Term Facility was changed at the company’s request through a CAL in April 2010 wherein the purpose of the facility was to enable the company to finance up to 50 per cent contribution to establish the port and a New Chennai Township Pvt Ltd. Again, in June 2010, a revised CAL was issued making amendments to the earlier CAL, and a term loan was utilised by Marg with repayment to be made in 21 equated quarterly instalments from July 2011. 
However, the company failed to repay as agreed and the bank initiated Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) proceedings. The DRT-II, Chennai, issued a Debt Recovery Certificate in favour of the bank for ₹71.69 crore from Marg.
As ICICI Bank has proved the existence of debt and default against the company by showing various documents and certificate issued by the DRT-II, the NCLT Bench admitted the company petition by appointing Vasudevan as the Interim Resolution Profession."

In more trouble for the country’s private sector lenders, Fitch Ratings has downgraded the ratings of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank due to ‘challenges’ faced by them and lowering of India’s operating environment.
Fitch Ratings has downgraded ICICI Bank’s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to ‘BB+’ from ‘BBB-’ and its Viability Rating to ‘bb+’ from ‘bbb-’. The outlook on the IDR is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed ICICI Bank’s Support Rating at 3 and Support Rating Floor at ‘BB+’, it said in a statement late on Monday evening.
“The one notch downgrade ….belief that several of ICICI’s key financial indicators are generally weaker than those of banks rated higher by Fitch as well as many similarly Fitch-rated banks operating in environments broadly comparable with that facing Indian banks,” it said.
It also downgraded the Long-Term IDR and Viability Rating of Axis Bank to ‘BB+’ and ‘bb+’, respectively, from ‘BBB-’ and ‘bbb-’. The outlook is Stable. “Fitch has also affirmed Axis’ Support Rating and Support Rating Floor at 3 and ‘BB+’, respectively,” it further said.
Commenting on the rating downgrade, it further said it lowered its midpoint for India’s operating environment to ‘bb+’ from ‘bbb-’ following a review of the banking sector’s performance, particularly in the last three years, and its regulatory framework, as well as the outlook in the near-term.
Seemingly hopeful of a recovery in the banking sector, the rating agency said, “The performance of Indian banks should have largely bottomed out, but the sector is still struggling with poor asset quality and weak core capitalisation.”"

 Top private sector lenders have cut their interest rates on deposits by up to 0.25 per cent over the last week, officials said Monday.
Generally, an interest rate cut in deposits is seen as a precursor to a lending rate cut. The moves by lenders including ICICI Bank and Axis Bank come amid easing liquidity conditions and also within days of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank earlier this month.
The RBI is betting on rate cuts, and a subsequent pass-on of the same by the banks to borrowers, as one of the ways to prop-up the sagging economic growth.
ICICI Bank is understood to have cut its fixed deposit rates by 0.10-0.25 per cent starting from Monday, officials said.
Under the revised rates for domestic deposits under Rs 2 crore, ICICI Bank will be paying 6.75 per cent for a deposit of 290 days to under a year, and 7.30 per cent for a deposit of over two years to under three years, according to the rates on the bank’s website.
Its smaller rival Axis Bank has cut its deposit rates by up to 0.15 per cent in select buckets, a bank spokesperson said.
All the downward reviews have been for deposits of over one year, the spokesperson said.
On the quantum of the cuts, a majority of them have been 0.15 per cent, while in the case of deposits of over Rs 2 crore for a period between 3-5 years, the cut is 0.10 per cent.

That means, traders will have to fork out ₹17,393.75, which would be the maximum loss one can suffer. ICICI Bank has to settle between the strike price, that is, between ₹400 and ₹425 at the time of expiry.
However, profit potentials are high, if ICICI Bank moves in any one of the direction, a close above ₹437.65 or below ₹387.35 will start yielding positive results.

25,2019-08-11,ICICI,"After a turbulent year, is the worst over for banks? 
At first glance, aggregate earnings of banks in the latest June quarter that ended in the black — from a loss posted in the same quarter last year, a double-digit loan growth, a fall in provisions and bad loans — usher in a sense of optimism that the worst may be over for the beaten-down sector.
But it is only when you dig deeper into individual bank results that a worrying trend of rise in slippages and stressed book, weak core performance, and low NPA recoveries emerges.
In the March 2018 quarter, after the RBI’s earlier circular on resolution of stressed accounts, banks had reported steep rise in slippages (over ₹1-lakh crore in that quarter alone) and provisioning.
The large pile up of bad loans continued to weigh on banks’ earnings in the following quarters through FY19.
Hence, against a sombre performance last year, the numbers reported by banks in the latest June quarter look optically good. For instance, PSBs had reported a loss of over ₹12,000 crore last June quarter, as against a profit of over ₹4,000 crore in the June quarter this year.
In the private bank space too, a low-profit base has made this year’s June quarter earnings appear healthy.
ICICI Bank had reported a loss of ₹120 crore in the June quarter last year; it delivered a profit of ₹1,908 crore in the June quarter this year.
But asset quality and core performance of some leading PSBs and private sector banks suggest that earnings could be under pressure in the upcoming quarters.
While the headline bad loan numbers have declined by about 5 per cent Y-o-Y, they have inched up sequentially, compared with the March quarter.










Banks’ exposure to certain stressed companies in the NBFC space and Reliance ADAG Group has resulted in slippages and increase in stressed book. For YES Bank, a significant rise in slippages and a rise in stressed accounts remain a concern. The slippages went up to ₹6,232 crore in the June quarter from ₹3,481 crore in the March quarter. YES Bank had identified ₹10,000 crore of stressed accounts in real estate, media and entertainment and infrastructure sectors in the March quarter; this went up to ₹29,470 crore in the June quarter.
For ICICI Bank, while overall slippages fell notably in the June quarter to ₹2,779 crore from ₹3,547 crore in the March quarter, there were additions to retail bad loans (₹1,511 crore of slippages), which included ₹452-crore slippages from the Kisan Credit Card portfolio. Also, the stressed book — BB and below-rated — remains significant at ₹15,355 crore. For Axis Bank, gross slippages went up to ₹4,798 crore; it was the substantial write-offs of ₹3,005 crore (rather than recovery) that led to the marginal decline in bad loans.
HDFC Bank has continued to keep asset-quality pressure at bay. While the bank’s GNPAs, in absolute terms, has been growing at 30-40 per cent annually over the past two years, strong growth in loans has kept the delinquency ratio (1.4 per cent of loans) under check. But the bank has been facing stress in its agri portfolio.
The trend in PSBs has not been comforting. The first quarterly results of Bank of Baroda, after its merger with Vijaya and Dena Bank, had signs of stress on profitability and asset quality. While bad loans came down marginally in absolute terms, slippages and write-offs remained elevated.
As of June, the watchlist of the merged entity is a huge ₹16,500 crore — slippages from this can lead to higher provisioning in the coming quarters. For PNB, a still large loan book and deferment of provisions with respect to certain frauds can add pressure on earnings. SBI, the country’s largest bank, saw slippages of ₹16,212 crore (from ₹7,505 crore in the March quarter). This is hardly comforting for a bank already sitting on a bad loan book of over ₹1.6-lakh crore.
A substantial pool of stressed assets remains a concern, and quick resolution of large accounts under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) will be critical.
On the core performance front, private banks grew their loan book at a faster clip compared to PSBs. ICICI Bank reported a growth of 18 per cent in domestic loans, led by 22 per cent in retail. Its net interest income grew by a strong 27 per cent Y-o-Y in the June quarter. HDFC Bank delivered growth of 17 per cent in loans and 23 per cent in NII. Axis Bank’s domestic loan growth was a healthy 19 per cent.
For State-owned bank PNB, a notable 12 per cent fall in NII and a weak capital ratio are a concern. SBI’s domestic loan growth stood at 12 per cent in the June quarter, lagging behind leading private sector banks."

ICICI Bank plans to grow its retail loan disbursement by 30 per cent in Karnataka during 2019-20, according to Anup Bagchi, Executive Director of the bank.
Addressing presspersons in Mangaluru on Thursday, Bagchi said retail consumer loans have witnessed significant growth in Karnataka over the last few years.
 Stating that there has been a robust growth in the economy of the State, he said the bank sees the potential of increasing retail loan disbursement in Karnataka by 30 per cent to ₹13,700 crore during 2019-20.
Bagchi said personal loan and auto loan are witnessing an upswing within the consumer loan portfolio. “We have seen good uptick in tier-2 towns such as Hubballi, Belagavi, Kolar, Kalaburagi, Raichur, Davanagere, Shivamogga and Mangaluru for personal loans from both salaried class as well as self-employed individuals. Within the personal loan portfolio, we are also witnessing significant traction in business loans from the self-employed segment as they prefer short-term access to credit,” he said.
 The demand for auto loans in tier-2 and tier-3 towns has been growing rapidly, and the bank’s focus will be to tap the potential in cities such as Mysuru, Mangaluru, Udupi, Dharwad-Hubballi, Tumakuru and Belagavi, he said. On the slump in the auto sector, he said there has been good growth in loan disbursement in the used-car segment. 
On mortgage loan disbursement in the State, he said the bank has adopted a multi-pronged strategy with a focus on the affordable housing sector to drive growth in this segment."

ICICI Bank becomes the first bank in India to launch ‘Robotic Arms’ for currency note sorting.
   -  Bloomberg


ICICI Bank has deployed Industrial ‘Robotic Arms’ for note sorting at its currency chests across 12 cities. It has become the first commercial bank in the country to customise and deploy industrial robots to automate and perform repetitive high volume steps in handling cash processing on high-end note sorting machines.
Anubhuti Sanghai, Head - Operations & Customer Service, ICICI Bank, said, “We have undertaken a large deployment of 14 industrial robotic arms at our prominent currency chests across 12 cities to digitise the currency sorting process. We will continue to invest in further mechanisation of note sorting technology and the next generation machines across all our currency chests.”
Asked about the benefits flowing from the deployment of industrial robots at currency chests, she said that the benefits include space optimisation; scalability (work uninterrupted for longer days) and ability of handling higher volumes.
""With this announcement, we have finished deployment of industrial robots in the identified locations. As of now, we are not looking at adding more. But we certainly are going to set up more currency chests. We will then take a call on technology developments and also on the next round of expansion (for industrial robots deployment)"", Sanghai said. 
Deployment of 'robotic arms' in the currency chests at the 12 locations does not mean that already employed people in these chests will go redundant. ""Even in these 12 locations, we will have people operating smaller machines"", she said.
Each industrial robotic arm feeds unprocessed cash in three high-end note-sorting machines simultaneously, picks up processed cash from the output stackers, aligns the loose notes, binds the packets and finally drops them in the respective trays as per quality of the note. The robotic arms use a combination of sensors to check over 70 parameters within seconds that enable them to operate continuously and seamlessly without any break.
The robotic arms have been deployed in New Delhi, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Bhopal, Sangli, Mangaluru, Raipur, Siliguri and Varanasi.
These robotic arms now help sort over six million notes every working day and 1.8 billion annually."
22,2019-09-04,ICICI,"ICICI Bank lowers MCLR by 10 bps 


ICICI Bank, the second-largest private sector lender, has cut its lending rates by 0.10 per cent across all maturities, sources said on Wednesday. The rates have been cut across all tenors under the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) system, they said.
With this cut, which comes amid repeated RBI nudges to slash rates, the total quantum of rate reduction by the bank since April stands at 0.20 per cent.
 Under the revised rates, effective September 1, the bank’s one-year MCLR will come down to 8.55 per cent, while the overnight MCLR will be 8.30 per cent.
 The one-year MCLR is considered important from a retail loans perspective, as a bank’s long-term loans like home loans are linked to this rate.
 Its larger rival HDFC Bank’s one-year MCLR stands at 8.60 per cent as of now, while the same for the third-largest private sector lender, Axis Bank, is at 8.55 per cent.
 ICICI Bank had last reviewed its interest rates in the first week of July, when it effected a 0.05 per cent reduction.
 The RBI has been disappointed with banks for not passing on the lower rates to borrowers, despite four successive rate cuts of 1.10 per cent in 2019 and 0.85 per cent since April.
 According to the RBI, banks have passed on only under 0.30 per cent benefits to borrowers till August, against 0.75 per cent of its cuts. Banks say it takes time for its liabilities to get re-priced, which results in the delay in transmission of RBI’s moves."

 Wipro Ltd has secured a strategic seven-year engagement, valued at $300 million, from ICICI Bank to provide a comprehensive suite of services. 
“This engagement will further strengthen our endeavour to provide differentiated technology and digital capabilities to the financial services industry,” a Wipro statement said.
Currently, IT services company Vara lnfotech provides these services to ICICI Bank. As part of the latest deal, Wipro will absorb about 3,800 employees of Vara lnfotech along with its existing contracts, facilities and assets, on a going-concern basis, through a business transfer agreement for an all-cash consideration of ₹321 crore.

20,2019-09-05,ICICI,"‘No big deal’: Analysts not warm to Wipro-ICICI Bank deal
Analysts said that while Wipro’s $300-million deal with ICICI Bank is a large deal, it is still a low profitability business. 
Wipro on Wednesday announced a seven-year deal with ICICI Bank for a total contract value of $300 million. The deal is expected to start delivering revenues from this month itself. As part of this strategic engagement, Wipro will absorb about 3,800 employees of Vara lnfotech along with its existing contracts, facilities and assets. 
“We see this deal to be similar to the people takeover deals that have gained prominence in the sector over the recent years. It provides revenue visibility of 0.2 per cent of Wipro’s FY20E revenues and 0.4 per cent bps on annualised basis,” said Emkay global in a note to investors.
It said that while margin details have not been shared, the margins for this business will certainly be dilutive to Wipro’s native IT Services margins, given the low revenue productivity of Vara lnfotech’s business ($8.3k for Vara vs $47.3k for Wipro). Vara Infotech had revenues of ₹200 crore in FY19. Vara Infotech used to provide BPO, App Services and Infra support to ICICI bank. 
Wipro plans to leverage its Automation platform Wipro Holmes to derive synergies out of this deal. “We believe that Wipro’s relative under performance is here to stay in FY20E as sectoral weakness can possibly drive a growth moderation in its Financial Services vertical, where the company did well in FY19 (up 16 per cent YoY in CC terms). Wipro’s large buybacks (7 per cent in FY18 and 5.5 per cent in FY19) have so far supported its stock price.
HDFC Securities in its note said that Wipro is struggling to grow whereas larger peers are clocking double-digit growth rate. BFSI, which was the key revenue driver for Wipro is in slowdown. Issues such as completion of large projects (consumer), delay in decision making (BFSI, Manufacturing) and deferral in ramp-up of large projects is impacting growth. 
The guidance for Q2 in FY20 indicates that the lag is entrenched. Margin expansion is difficult and the buyback trade is over. Wipro has underperformed in the last three months (-8 per cent vs NIFTY IT -3 per cent) and the trend will continue unless growth revives, the note said. 
BOB Capital Markets in its note said that despite several strategic interventions, Wipro has underperformed its tier-I IT service peers in terms of revenues and earnings over the past seven years. Regulatory uncertainty for the healthcare business, restructuring of India and Middle East operations, and a muted outlook for the BFSI and manufacturing verticals cloud recovery prospects.
Wipro’s shares were flat at ₹255.55 at the close of trading on Thursday."
19,2019-09-12,ICICI,"ToT highway project: ICICI Bank takes over ₹2,000 cr debt financing from Yes Bank


ICICI Bank has taken a bite of the debt funding for India’s first Toll-Operate and Transfer (ToT) highway project by taking over about ₹2,000 crore from the original lender YES Bank Ltd in a move that will likely give a much-needed push and confidence among lenders to fund such deals amidst a general slackness in funding core projects.
YES Bank had underwritten the entire debt portion of about ₹5,000 crore last August, helping the successful bidder, Australia’s Macquarie Group, to achieve financial closure for the project hours before a deadline set by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) ended.
This has allowed Macquarie Group to pay upfront ₹9,681.5 crore to NHAI for the deal which it won through an auction.
Under the ToT model, the right to collect user-fee or toll on selected national highway stretches built through public funding will be auctioned and assigned to a concessionaire for a period of 30 years against an upfront payment of a lump-sum amount to the government.
The concessionaire is also responsible for the operation and maintenance of the roads during the tenure.

Macquarie will be required to invest a further ₹1,000 in this regard, taking the total project cost to about ₹10,600 crore. Apart from the ₹5,000 crore loan sanctioned by YES Bank, the Macquarie Group and its associates brought in more than ₹5,000 crore as equity into the project, an NHAI official said.
The ₹1,000 crore capital augmentation to improve the road asset will also be funded by YES Bank. This will be availed by Macquarie at a later date.
“The entire debt was initially underwritten by YES Bank, but they don’t want to hold on to the full portfolio. ICICI Bank has already taken ₹2,000 crore out of the sanctioned amount of ₹5,000 crore,” a banker familiar with the deal said, asking not to be named.
YES Bank, struggling to raise funds for growth, is “still syndicating the balance ₹3,000 crore loan but is looking to down-sell its portion”, the banker said, adding that “other lenders were reluctant to step-in”.
“In ToT projects, foreign investors are coming, but they need co-operation from Indian banks,” Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari told investors and bankers on Monday during a roadshow organised by NHAI in Mumbai.
“The problem is that Indian banks are not ready to do financial closure with them; then it is meaningless to go for ToT. You need to find a way out. Timing is most important for financial closure, otherwise the successful bidder will have to pay penalty,” he said.
Besides, the ToT concessionaire is allowed to collect tolls from the day financial closure is achieved.
State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, says that it was “comfortable” with funding ToT projects.

“The only problem with ToT is that banks may feel there is aggressive bidding. If there is aggressive bidding, we will ask for sponsor support, good coverage ratios and sufficient cushion for operation and management expenses,” SBI Chairman, Rajnish Kumar, said.
“NHAI should also reconcile to the fact that if it is all about maximisation of value and money (in ToT), then financing issues can crop up. There will be a difference of opinion and my experience as a banker has been, wherever there has been competitive bidding, there will be aggressive bidding and later on things won’t turn out the way it should have been,” he added."

A Committee of Creditors (CoC) has approved the settlement offer submitted by GRK Reddy, the promoter of Chennai-based infrastructure developer Marg Ltd, by a majority vote, helping the embattled businessman regain control over his company that was admitted to a bankruptcy court this May.
On May 28, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Chennai, had ordered the start of corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) against Marg for defaulting on dues of ₹71.69 crore to ICICI Bank. Reddy appealed the ruling at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
During a hearing on September 30, D Srinivasan, counsel for ICICI Bank, informed NCLAT that the CoC has accepted the terms of settlement submitted by Reddy under Section 12A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). “Therefore, ICICI Bank Limited has moved an application before the adjudicating authority for the withdrawal of the application filed under Section 7 of the IBC,” he told NCLAT.
After hearing the parties, NCLAT allowed ICICI Bank to withdraw the petition. “The impugned order dated 28 May 2019 for initiating Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is set aside along with consequential steps taken. The application under Section 7 filed by the ICICI Bank is disposed of as withdrawn. The corporate debtor (Marg) is released from all rigour of law. The Resolution Professional will hand over the assets and documents to the corporate debtor through the promoter,” ruled NCLAT.
“The corporate debtor is directed to pay the stakeholders/creditors in terms of settlement reached under Section 12A within the period as approved by the CoC, failing which it will be open to ICICI Bank to file an application for the recall of this order and revival of CIRP against the corporate debtor,” said NCLAT."

 The Indian tea industry, which has been facing difficulty in getting bank finance, might soon get some respite. The Tea Board of India has roped in ICICI Bank to extend credit facility in the form of corporate credit card to the buyers registered on its auction platform.
According to Arun Kumar Ray, Deputy Chairman, Tea Board, the move would help facilitate smooth remittance of auction proceeds. A similar facility to the sellers in the form of bill discounting is also under consideration to meet the short-term financial needs of the sellers.
The scheme is likely to be implemented by end November or early December.
“The tea industry has been finding it difficult to get bank funding. The credit card would enable buyers to settle the auction payments within the time limit and avail 45 days’ credit period from the bank. This will also ease the liquidity crunch of the auction buyers, if any, and enhance participation in the auction process,” Ray told newspersons here on Wednesday.
The country had produced close to 1,350 million kg (mkg) of tea in 2018-19. Nearly 600 mkg of tea estimated at a total value of around ₹8,400 crore was sold on the auction platform last year. Default on the total volume transacted on the auction platform has been to the tune of four-to-five per cent. 
ICICI Bank is the Settlement Banker for Tea Board in respect of auction payments. However, according to industry insiders, more than the liquidity problem, it is the issue of demand and supply which is a cause of concern at present.
“The supply is huge and demand is not in tandem with the increase in production. Even if the buyer gets credit facility, if there is no demand increase in the secondary market then he will find it difficult to sell the tea and repay the money to the bank,” the industry source said.
The Tea Board is mulling the option of routing the entire Darjeeling tea produced onto its auction platform. The move will help ensure traceability and protect the GI tag. It would also lead to fair price realisation for the tea.
The proposal would be discussed at a meeting with the members of the Darjeeling Tea Association to be held end of this month, said Ray."

 Leading private banking majors and index heavyweights Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank will declare their second quarter results of the current fiscal on Tuesday. With HDFC Bank coming out strong numbers, most market participants expect other private banks to perform well.
Elara Securities expects ICICI Bank to report a whopping 165 per cent jump in adjusted net profit to Rs 2,409 crore as against year-ago's Rs 908.90 crore. However, the broking house expects its topline to grow at a modest 17 per cent at Rs 11,204.30 crore.
For Kotak Mahindra, Elara expects, a topline growth of 16.5 per cent y-o-y at Rs 4,536.80 crore and 39 per cent jump in adjusted net profit toat Rs 1,586.40 crore.
HDFC Securities although expects Kotak Mahindra Bank to deliver yet another quarter of steady performance across parameters and see definitive RoAE expansion (due to tax cuts), the broking house has retained its neutral rating on the stock, as ""valuations seem rich"".
With tax benefits, net earnings are expected to grow at about 30 per cent, it said and added comments on the mandated reduction in the promoter’s stake, is one of the crucial factor to watch.
On the other hand, HDFC Securities says ICICI Bank's net earnings at Rs 780 crore, as the broking firm expects deferred tax asset (DTA) to impact it significantly. However, it does not see any 'significant stress' going forward for ICICI Bank.
Kotak Securities expect adjusted PAT decline 73 per cent at Rs 245.20 crore but topline to grow 24 per cent at Rs 7,979.70 crore.
Prabhudas Lilladhar believes ICICI Bank will likely be outlier with lower asset quality issues with steady slippages and very limited additions to stress book; and tax cuts to benefit Kotak Bank’s ROE to some extent.

According to a domestic broking firm, this will result in a flow of approximately $1.2 billion into the ICICI Bank stock.

Is the worst over for ICICI Bank?
   -  Reuters


For ICICI Bank, much like its peer Axis Bank quarterly slippages and pace of addition to stressed book has been in focus over the past several quarters. Comfortingly, ICICI Bank has delivered healthy core performance and steady decline in bad loan book over the past few quarters. In the latest September quarter, the bank saw a healthy 16 per cent growth in domestic loans, driven by 22 per cent growth in retail loans, leading to a strong 25.5 per cent growth in its core net interest income. Since September quarter of last year, the bank’s bad loan book has been shrinking, while provision cover has gone up substantially. As of September 2019 quarter, ICICI Bank’s bad loans stood at ₹45,639 crore or 6.37 per cent of loans (as against 8.54 per cent a year ago).

So, is the worst over for ICICI Bank?
While healthy core performance and falling slippages lend comfort, there are other trends that could weigh on earnings in the coming quarters, warranting a watch. One, ICICI Bank’s BB and below rated corporate and SME book is still large at ₹16,074 crore as of September 2019 quarter. In fact, there has been a 5 per cent sequential increase in this stressed book in the September quarter. Two, recoveries are still low while write-offs remain elevated. Three, growth in retail loans in recent quarters has been led by unsecured segments such as personal loans and credit cards. The risk in this portfolio will need a watch. As such retail NPAs have gone up notably over the past year.
Hence unless there is a strong uptick in recoveries and significant reduction in the stressed book, the stock may not get re-rated significantly. Sustainability of strong core performance, moderation in slippages and high provision cover will be critical in the coming quarters.
In the latest September quarter, gross non-performing assets (GNPA) stood at ₹45,639 crore down from ₹45,763 crore in the June quarter and ₹54,489 crore in the same quarter last year. Slippages too have fallen in the September quarter to ₹2,482 crore from ₹2,779 crore in the June quarter---with the pace accretion to bad loans moderating in both corporate and retail segments.
However, recoveries remained modest at ₹1,263 crore while write-offs were notable at ₹1,328 crore. Importantly, the BB and below rated book for ICICI Bank is still large, and further slippages from this book in the coming quarters can weigh on the bank’s performance.
The bank’s exposure to certain stressed sectors may also weigh on the asset quality. ICICI Bank’s exposure to the power sector stood at ₹33,406 crore as of September 2019 quarter, of which a little over ₹11,000 crore are classified as NPA or form part of BB and below rated book. Given the persisting challenges in the power sector, the bank’s exposure to this segment would need monitoring. ICICI Bank’s exposure to the telecom sector stood at 1.8 per cent of total exposure or ₹20,000 crore as of September 2019, which may also need to be monitored in light of the recent Supreme Court’s verdict on adjusted gross revenue, is expected to hurt telecom operators and their debt repayment ability.
On the core performance front, the bank’s net interest income (NII) has grown by a strong 25.5 per cent YoY in the September quarter. The strong growth in retail loans has helped offset the slack in corporate loans. ICICI Bank has significantly increased its focus on retail loans. From 46 per cent in FY16, retail constituted 62 per cent of loans in the September quarter.
But the growth in retail loans in recent quarters has been led by unsecured segments such as personal loans and credit cards. In the latest September quarter too, the two segments grew by a robust 50.6 per cent and 40 per cent respectively. While there have been no alarming trends in the retail NPAs, the risk in the portfolio will need a watch. Gross retail NPAs have gone up to ₹7,539 crore in the September quarter from ₹5,463 crore in the same quarter last year."

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has rejected a proposal by ICICI Bank for appointment of Sandeep Batra as an executive director (ED) after SEBI penalised him in a case related to merger of Bank of Rajasthan.
It has said the proposal can be submitted one year after the settlement proceedings with SEBI is concluded. “The Bank has received a communication from RBI not acceding to the request for appointment of Batra at present and to resubmit the proposal for approval after one year from the conclusion of settlement proceedings,” ICICI Bank said in a regulatory filing late on Friday night.
The board of directors of ICICI Bank had proposed the appointment of Batra as an ED for a five year period on May 6, 2019 subject to RBI approval. However, market regulator SEBI in an order on September 12 had levied a penalty of ₹2 lakh on Batra in his capacity as the Compliance Officer of the Bank in 2010.
“The order was in respect of a matter wherein ICICI Bank had made a disclosure after its Board meeting held on May 18, 2010 providing an in-principle approval for the amalgamation of The Bank of Rajasthan (eBoR) with the Bank,” ICICI Bank said, adding it had entered into an agreement earlier on the same day with certain shareholders of eBoR. “The disclosure made by the Bank after the Board meeting was construed as delayed disclosure by SEBI while issuing the order,” ICICI Bank further said.
Settlement proceedings under SEBI (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations, 2018 have been initiated in this regard by Batra."
6,2019-11-05,ICICI,"Amid lacklustre demand from infra sector, ICICI Bank shuts project financing division 
ICICI Bank has shut its project financing division in a bid to reduce its exposure to long-term assets, especially in the infrastructure sector, and focus on retail and unsecured lending. Executives working in this division have been sent to others, including corporate banking.
The move comes in the backdrop of lacklustre credit demand from the infrastructure sector.
Banks are baulking at funding infrastructure projects due to asset-liability mismatches (with the projects requiring long-term financing but banks funding them through short-term liabilities), delays in statutory clearances, and bad loans.
“The bank has been saying it will reduce its exposure to long-term assets and to lower rated corporates. It has also been focussing more on unsecured and retail lending. Also, there is no huge demand for infrastructure projects these days. But if there is a good project or borrower then the bank is always there to lend,” said an industry source.
The source added that the team may have been reduced as it was felt that there is no need for a dedicated team.
According to Reserve Bank of India data on sectoral deployment of bank credit, the outstanding credit of scheduled commercial banks to the infrastructure sector has come down by ₹52,135 crore so far this fiscal (up to September-end), against a growth of ₹45,747 crore in the year-ago period.
ICICI Bank was among the biggest infrastructure lenders till 2013. But the economic downturn and poor regulatory environment hit the infrastructure sector, which in turn added to ICICI Bank’s rising NPAs.
The dismal performance of the infrastructure sector can be attributed to loan impairment resulting in lending constraints due to tighter regulatory norms and adverse effects on profitability, especially in telecommunication and power, said RBI officials Jessica M. Anthony, Shiv Shankar and Satyananda Sahoo in an article in the RBI bulletin.

With widespread damages due to floods across the country, the insurers are likely to take a hit. (A representational image)


Faced with significant losses from natural calamities, a number of general insurers are understood to be reviewing their crop insurance portfolios and even considering moving out of the segment.
While ICICI Lombard General Insurance has already announced its decision to exit crop insurance under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) due to high reinsurance rates, industry data suggest that Cholamandalam MS General Insurance has also exited the segment.
According to government data, the gross premium under PMFBY in FY19 is estimated to be ₹20,923 crore, while the claims amounted to ₹27,550 crore.
Significantly, state-owned re-insurer General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC) has also scaled down its crop insurance portfolio in the face of huge losses and claims.
Data from the General Insurance Council reveal that the gross direct premium income for Cholamandalam MS fell nearly 91 per cent in the first six months of the fiscal year to ₹5.26 crore, against ₹210.87 crore in the same period a year ago. Cholamandalam MS did not respond to an email query from BusinessLine.
Interestingly, gross direct premium income from crop insurance for all non-life insurers increased 26.5 per cent to ₹19,217.65 crore between April and September this year, against ₹15,185.98 crore in the year-ago period.
“Crop insurance has been doing reasonably well although a lot also depends on the districts with the insurer. The claims ratio has been high for some segments but most insurers remain bullish,” said an industry source, adding that many insurers may choose to come back to the segment next year.
Sources said public sector general insurers, such as National Insurance and New India Insurance, have been taking on more crop business along with a few private sector players. Agriculture Insurance Company, a specialised PSU, continues to do the bulk of the crop insurance.
Bhargav Dasgupta, MD and CEO of ICICI Lombard, while announcing the company’s second-quarter results last month, had said that it has not been able to write any crop business this year. “Reinsurance terms have turned adverse for insurance companies, so it doesn’t make sense. Rates on the ground are more aggressive,” he had said."

3,2019-11-11,ICICI,"Consider a bull call spread on ICICI Bank 
The outlook for the stock of ICICI Bank (₹488.5) remains positive. As long as it stays above ₹380, the long term bullish trend will remain intact. The stock finds an immediate support at ₹462. If the current trend remains, ICICI Bank has the potential to reach ₹580.
F&O pointers: Despite the stock posting a strong gain, ICICI Bank futures shed open interest on Friday, signalling profit booking by some traders. Open interest did not see a secular accumulation, as it witnessed heightened activity last week due to Bank's result announcement. Option trading indicates a range of ₹440 and ₹500 for the stock.
Strategy: Traders could consider a bull call spread on ICICI Bank, which can be initiated by buying the ₹485-call and simultaneously selling the ₹500-call. They closed with a premium of ₹15.50 and ₹8.80 respectively. Traders have to incur an outflow if ₹9,212.50 to adopt this strategy. This would be the maximum loss one can suffer, if the stock closes at or below ₹485. A maximum profit of ₹11,412.50 (market lot: 1,375 shares per contract) is possible if ICICI Bank closes at or above ₹500. We advice traders to hold the options till expiry.
Alternatively, traders with a high-risk ability can consider going long on ICICI Bank futures with an initial stop-loss at ₹465. If the stock stays above ₹480 on the first half of Monday, then the stop-loss can be shifted to ₹480. Initial target is ₹516 while traders with deep pockets could wait till ₹538. However, remember to keep a strict trailing stop-loss

The stock of ICICI Bank, after moving sideways for a period of two weeks, broke out on Tuesday with huge volumes. It recorded a fresh lifetime high of ₹517.55 and closed above the crucial level of ₹500 for the first time. Thus, the prospect of the stock advancing further looks high. So long as the stock manages to trade above ₹490, the possibility of a trend reversal is low.
The stock had a volatile opening this year where it declined to ₹336.15 in February. But in March, the stock started to move upward gradually and breached the then 52-week high of ₹442. The uptrend lasted for three months and subsequently, it witnessed a corrective phase. The stock price moderated from the high of ₹442 to ₹384.35 in September. What followed was a strong bull run, which continues till date, and as a result the stock has now moved past ₹500.
Hence, investors with short-term perspective can buy the stock with strict stop-loss at ₹490 for a target of ₹535.
