Bajaj Finance on Wednesday said it will pick up nearly 11 per cent stake in mobile wallet company Mobikwik for about Rs 225 crore. In a BSE filing, Bajaj Finance said it has entered into a subscription agreement with One MobiKwik Systems.
Under the agreement, it will acquire 10 equity shares and 271,050 compulsory convertible preference shares (CCPS) of Mobikwik. “Post conversion of CCPS, the company would hold approximately 10.83 per cent of equity in MobiKwik on a fully diluted basis,” it added. The value of the transaction envisaged is about Rs 225 crore, it added. The company said the conclusion of the transaction is subject to fulfilment of certain conditions in due course.
The company has also entered into a shareholders agreement which would become effective on conclusion of the above investment transaction, the filing further noted.
Last week, Mobikwik’s rival and Snapdeal—owned Freecharge was sold to Axis Bank for Rs 385 crore.
Earlier this year, MobiKwik had said it is looking at raising funding for its expansion plans as it looked to compete with larger rival Paytm that is backed by deep— pocketed investors like Alibaba and SoftBank.
Mobikwik has so far raised over USD 85 million in funding from investors like South Africa’s payments major Net1, Sequoia Capital, American Express, Tree Line Asia and Cisco Investments."

A few companies in the financial services space have turned multi-baggers in the last couple of years, thanks to their consistent and strong growth in earnings, backed by sound fundamentals. The stock price of Bajaj Finance has gone up over eight-fold over the last three years. A diversified non-banking finance company (NBFC), with focus on consumer, SME and commercial lending, Bajaj Finance has emerged a leader in most of its key segments.
The organisational restructuring it underwent in 2007, when it re-defined its core focus as consumer loans and small business financing, has paid off well. The company’s assets under management (AUM) and earnings have grown by a robust 50 per cent and 68 per cent annually respectively, between 2008-09 and 2015-16.
The stock has re-rated sharply in the last two to three years, now trading at 5.7 times its one-year forward book from about three times last year.
Since our ‘buy’ call last November, the stock has doubled. While the sharp run-up may limit near-term upside, the company’s long-term prospects remain sanguine. The stock’s premium valuations are likely to hold up, thanks to the company’s strong growth momentum, robust profitability, and good asset quality. The company recently announced a stock split (1:5) and a bonus (1:1), which should aid liquidity in the stock.
Investors with a two- to three-year horizon can buy the stock.
Bajaj Finance has been scaling up its business, diversifying into new segments and verticals, without losing its focus on profitability and asset quality.
Currently, the company’s business spans consumer finance, SME, commercial lending and rural. Within consumer finance, the company offers two- and three-wheeler finance, consumer durable, digital product, lifestyle product finance, personal loans and salaried home loans. With upbeat consumer spends, this segment has been delivering strong growth, with all verticals firing.
Within the SME segment, while business loans continue to show good traction, loan against property and self-employed home loans slowed as the company moved to a ‘direct to customer’ model. The management is expecting growth to pick up in these segments in the second half of this fiscal.
As of June end, the company’s assets under management stood at ₹49,608 crore, a growth of 40 per cent year-on-year.
The company’s diverse portfolio offers good scope for cross selling of products to customers. The ability to mine the existing client base augurs well for profitability. Of the 2.5 million customers acquired in the June quarter, 1.1 million were new. According to the management, the cross-sell rate for the quarter was much higher at 60 per cent than the usual 40-odd per cent. As new verticals gain traction, it will open newer avenues for growth.
Over the next two to three years, the company plans to shift to a product mix of 35 per cent consumer loans (now 44 per cent), 45 per cent SME (40 per cent), 13 per cent commercial (12 per cent) and 7 per cent rural (3 per cent). This, the management believes, will lead to healthy returns.
While on the one hand, robust offtake in loans and improving margins helped the company’s net interest income (NII) grow, shifting to direct-to-customer model and operating leverage led to a fall in the cost to income ratio, boosting profitability. In the June quarter, NII grew a robust 45 per cent year-on-year, while cost to income fell from 46 per cent to 41 per cent. On a longer term perspective, the management expects cost to income to hover in the 38-40 per cent range, with the company’s focus on technology and digitisation leading to operational leverage.
Bajaj Finance has been able to maintain steady asset quality. While its gross non-performing assets inched up sequentially in the June quarter, it was mainly due to the transition from 150-days NPA recognition to 120 days this fiscal as per the RBI’s norms.
The net NPAs — gross NPAs less provision — stood at 0.41 per cent of total loans in the June quarter, higher than the 0.28 per cent in the March quarter.
The management has indicated some pressure in the self-employed home loans segment as some large accounts in the northern market became NPAs.
Overall, the company’s return ratios remain healthy — return on assets at 3.6 per cent (annualised) and return on equity at 22 per cent (annualised).
It is also well capitalised to fund its growth with total capital adequacy ratio at 17.8 per cent in the June quarter."

 April 4 Shares of Bajaj Finance hit over 5-month high, and technicals suggested further upside. The stock jumped as much as 1.3 per cent to Rs 1,858, its highest since October 19, 2017.

Trend intensity (TI) indicator rising to 18 confirmed the start of the new uptrend. The stock's 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) also cut above its 50-day EMA last week, another bullish signal for the stock.
The breakout suggested that the stock may now move towards the next Fibonacci resistance at Rs 1,979.3, the 38.2 per cent projection level.
The stock was up 4.4 per cent so far this year as of Tuesday, compared with a fall of 2.7 per cent for the NSE Index."
18,2018-04-14,Bajaj Finance,"Bajaj Finance: Driving growth
Amid the turmoil in the banking sector and persisting growth challenges, a few non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) have continued to deliver strong performance. With focus on consumer, SME, commercial and rural lending, Bajaj Finance has been the darling of the market, quadrupling in value over the past three years. Strong fundamentals, robust opportunity in the company’s key segments, investments in technology and a sound risk management system, should keep the growth momentum intact, going ahead.
Bajaj Finance’s assets under management (AUM) and earnings have grown by a robust 35 per cent (compounded annual growth) over the past five years. The company has been able to sport a steady return on assets in the range of 3.3-3.5 per cent, thanks to the strong traction in loans, healthy margins, and good asset quality.
While the stock trades at a premium to other NBFCs, given the healthy long-term prospects, earnings are expected to grow at 25-30 per cent in the next two to three years.
At the current price, the stock trades at 5.7 times the FY19 book value; Cholamandalam Investment and Finance and Sundaram Finance trade at 3.5-4 times. The stock’s premium valuations are likely to hold up. Investors with a two- to three-year horizon can buy the stock.
Strong business
Bajaj Finance is a diversified player focussing on financing mass affluent customers with presence in consumer financing, SME financing, commercial and rural lending.
Consumer finance — entailing two- and three-wheeler finance, consumer durable, digital product, lifestyle product finance, personal loans and salaried home loans — constitutes 47.9 per cent of the company’s AUM. Active distribution at various consumer durable stores, digital product outlets etc, and product innovations have kept the growth in good stead. Its unique existing member identification (EMI) card, for instance, which enables customers to get instant finance after the first purchase, has helped it strengthen its leadership within the consumer durable space. As of December 2017, the AUM of the consumer business grew 25 per cent Y-o-Y in its B2B segment and 52 per cent in the B2C space.
Within the SME segment, the company is focused on SMEs with an average annual sales of ₹10-12 crore; the growth in this division was lower, at 16 per cent Y-o-Y in the December quarter, owing to the management’s cautious approach to lending to the segment. SMEs constitute 31.5 per cent of the company’s AUM.
Commercial lending, including vendor financing, corporate finance, financial institutions lending has grown by a strong 52 per cent Y-o-Y in the latest December quarter, constituting 13.5 per cent of the AUM.
The rural lending business that caters to the consumer and MSME segment in rural markets has been growing at a robust pace, albeit on a low base. In future, the management expects the strategy to diversify geographically and penetrate rural India to drive growth in the medium term.
Bajaj Housing Finance Limited (BHFL), a 100 per cent subsidiary of Bajaj Finance, started its operations in July 2017. The company plans to book all incremental mortgage assets in Bajaj Housing Finance by March 2018 to ensure more focus on the business.
The company’s leading presence in core segments should drive loan growth of 25-30 per cent over the next two to three years. Growing competition in fintech lending, though, needs watching, with the likes of Amazon and Flipkart etc investing in cross-financing their customers.
On the profitability front, the company has been able to improve margins over the past two to three years, thanks to the notable fall in cost of funds. While the cost of funds is likely to increase in the medium term, the ability to pass on some of this to customers, should help margins. Operating expenses to net interest income stood at 40 per cent in the December quarter. While the management expects this to inch up in the near term, it expects the ratio to stabilise at 39-40 per cent over FY19.
Under check
In a bid to bring the NPA norms on par with banks, the RBI had directed NBFCs to implement the rules in a phased manner — from 150-day cut off by end of March 2016 to 90 days by the end of March 2018.
Bajaj Finance has always been better placed than others, on the back of an already stringent asset quality norm and higher provision cover. Hence, its asset quality has been more or less steady over the last few years. Gross NPA and net NPA as of December quarter (on 90-day cut off) stood at 1.67 per cent and 0.53 per cent respectively."

Global investment advisor Jefferies while retaining its ‘Buy’ recommendation on the stock with a price target of ₹4,750 said: Bajaj Finance’s asset quality was stable q-o-q. Loan growth moderated slightly, but was still robust. Falling marginal funding cost may aid margins. We expect higher credit cost near term, but this should ease. Opex leverage gains, strong fee income growth and lower tax rate, should lift RoA/ROE."
