At the end of the trading week on Friday, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDFC Bank, ITC, HUL, Maruti Suzuki India, SBI and Infosys were the ones to suffer losses in their market valuation, while Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), HDFC and ONGC made gains.
Maruti’s market capitalisation (m-cap) plunged Rs 8,980.84 crore to Rs 2,84,983.84 crore. The m-cap of Infosys slumped Rs 5,940.34 crore to Rs 2,21,037.56 crore and that of HDFC Bank dipped Rs 3,393.06 crore to Rs 4,81,879.55 crore. TCS’s valuation slipped by Rs 3,053.29 crore to Rs 5,13,880.93 crore and that of SBI declined by Rs 2,848.57 crore to Rs 2,64,313.49 crore. The m-cap of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) fell by Rs 2,510.79 crore to Rs 2,93,611.52 crore and that of ITC went down by Rs 243.81 crore to Rs 3,20,487.11 crore.
On the other hand, ONGC added Rs 3,914.14 crore to reach Rs 2,53,713.06 crore in valuation. HDFC’s mcap jumped Rs 2,484.25 crore to Rs 2,75,736.30 crore and that of RIL advanced Rs 1,235.03 crore to Rs 5,84,582.37 crore.
In the ranking of top-10 firms, RIL stood at number one position, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, ITC, HUL, Maruti, HDFC, SBI, ONGC and Infosys. During the first week of 2018, the Sensex notched up a rise of 97.02 points, or 0.28 per cent, while the broader Nifty gained 28.15 points, or 0.26 per cent."

ITC seeks for a direction


ITC is stuck in a narrow range for the third consecutive week. The support at ₹260 and resistance at ₹267 are key levels to watch in the coming days. A breakout on either side of these two levels will decide the next leg of move for the stock and give a cue on the upcoming trend. If the stock sustains above ₹260 and breaks above ₹267 decisively, the downside pressure will ease. Such a break can take it higher to ₹272 and will also give an early indication that the downtrend that has been in place since July 2017 could be ending. A decisive break and close above ₹272 will confirm the trend reversal and can target ₹277 and ₹280 thereafter. But if ITC declines below ₹260, it can dip to test the significant support level of ₹257. A further fall below ₹257 will then increase the possibility of the stock extending its down-move towards ₹252. Traders can hold the long positions and accumulate on dips at ₹257. Retain the stop-loss at ₹254 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹270.


Infosys can dip ahead of results


After a strong rally for four consecutive weeks, Infosys fell sharply last week by 2.6 per cent. Support is at ₹1,010. A break below it will increase the likelihood of the stock extending its current down-move to ₹980 or ₹975 this week, well ahead of the third quarter results announcement on Friday. The outcome of the quarterly results will then determine the next trend for the stock. If Infosys manages to bounce from ₹980-₹975, an upmove to ₹1,010 will be possible. But a fall below ₹975 can drag the stock further lower to ₹950 levels. On the other hand, if the stock sustains above ₹1,010 this week, a bounce to ₹1,035 and ₹1,045 is possible again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹1,010 and ₹1,045 can be seen for some time. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹1,045 is now needed for the stock to gain fresh momentum and rally further. The next target above ₹1,045 is ₹1,070. Investors can hold the long positions and can accumulate if the stock falls towards ₹980 in the coming days.


RIL is stuck in a narrow range


RIL has been stuck in a narrow range over the last couple of weeks. The immediate outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹908 and resistance is at ₹937. A breakout on either side of ₹908 or ₹937 will determine the next trend. Until then the stock can continue to trade sideways between ₹908 and ₹937. A strong break above ₹937 can ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take the stock higher to the crucial resistance level of ₹960. A strong break above ₹960 can boost the momentum and take the stock further higher to ₹1,000 levels thereafter. On the other hand, if RIL declines below ₹937 in the coming days, a fall to ₹895 or ₹890 is possible. A break below ₹890 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹880 or ₹875. As being reiterated over the last few weeks, the region between ₹880 and ₹875 is a crucial support zone. A decisive break below ₹875 will increase the possibility of a double-top reversal pattern on the chart. In such a scenario, the possibility of the stock falling to ₹854 will increase.


Short-term view is bearish for SBI


SBI fell last week as expected to touch a low of ₹301.65. Though it managed to reverse higher from the week’s low, the bounce-back move lacks strength. The stock made a high of ₹311.8 on Friday and came off from there to close 1 per cent lower. The short-term outlook remains bearish. A cluster of resistances in the broad ₹310-₹320 region can cap the upside in the short term. An intermediate bounce to this resistance zone if seen can see fresh sellers coming into the market. A fall to ₹294 or ₹292 is likely in the coming days. A strong break below ₹292 will increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹285. Traders who have taken short positions last week can hold them. Add more short positions at ₹314 if an intermediate bounce breaking above ₹310 is seen in the near term. Retain the stop-loss at ₹317 for the target of ₹294. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹305 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹299. The outlook will turn positive only on a strong break above ₹320. But such a strong move looks less probable.


Uptrend is intact in Tata Steel


Tata Steel rose for the third consecutive week and was up over 5 per cent last week. The strong surge rally last week strengthens the overall uptrend. Support at ₹735 can limit the downside in the near term. Dips to this support may find fresh buyers coming into the market. The downside could be limited to the next significant support levels of ₹715 and ₹690 even if the stock declines, breaking below ₹735. But such a fall looks less likely. As such, the possibility of the stock sustaining above ₹735 is high . A rally to ₹800 is likely. A strong break above ₹800 will increase the likelihood of the up-move extending to ₹825 and ₹850 levels. An intermediate pull-back move from ₹850 levels to ₹800 or ₹750 cannot be ruled out. But the overall uptrend will continue to remain intact. Tata Steel is now all set to revisit ₹930 and ₹950 levels from a medium to long-term perspective. Investors can hold the long positions. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹640. Consider booking partial profits around ₹900 levels."
75,2018-01-14,ITC,"Weekly trading guide: SBI, ITC, Infosys, RIL, Tata Steel
SBI (₹301.8) fell for the third consecutive week. The stock was down 1.4 per cent last week. The near-term outlook remains bearish. A fall below ₹300 towards ₹296 and ₹294 is likely in the coming days. If SBI manages to reverse higher from around ₹294, a relief rally to ₹300 is possible initially. A break above ₹300 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹305 or even ₹310 thereafter. But if SBI breaks decisively below ₹294, there is a strong likelihood of the downmove extending further to ₹285. The region around ₹285 is a key short-term support with the potential to halt the current downmove. A strong upward reversal from around ₹285 will increase the possibility of the stock rallying towards ₹300 or even higher thereafter. As such the price action around ₹285 will need a close watch to get a cue on the next leg of move. Traders can hold the short positions. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹310. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹303 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹299 for the target of ₹294.
ITC (₹267.5) surged over 4 per cent intra-week, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹267 and made a high of ₹273.8 last week. However, it fell back from the week’s high giving back most of the gains to close the week just 1.7 per cent higher. Immediate support is at ₹266. If ITC manages to reverse higher again from this support in the coming days, it can strengthen the bullish momentum and go to ₹272 and ₹273 levels again. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹273 will then pave the way for the next target of ₹280. Even if the stock breaks below ₹266 this week, the next significant supports between ₹264 and ₹263 and then at ₹260 can limit the downside. The outlook will turn bearish only if ITC declines decisively below ₹260, which looks less probable at the moment. Traders can hold the long positions with the revised stop-loss at ₹265 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹268 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹272. Short-term traders who do not hold any positions can initiate fresh long positions at current levels and also accumulate on dips at ₹264. Keep the stop-loss at ₹259 for the target of ₹280. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹270 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹274.
The prolonged wait is over. Infosys (₹1,078.4) finally cleared the key hurdle of ₹1,045 after struggling for over 14 months. The stock surged over 6 per cent last week to close on a strong note above ₹1,045. This gives an initial confirmation that the downtrend that was in place since June 2016 has reversed. Infosys is now all set to target ₹1,350 over the long-term. A near-term dip to ₹1,050-₹1,045 cannot be ruled out before the stock extends its upmove. Strong support is now available in the broad ₹1,045-₹1,000 region. Only a decisive fall below ₹1,000 will turn the outlook bearish. But such a break is unlikely as any intermediate dips in the stock will now attract fresh buyers. Next resistance is at ₹1,120 which is likely to be tested in the short-term. A strong break above ₹1,120 will then clear the way for the next target of ₹1,200 over the medium-term. Investors can hold the long positions. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go long on dips at ₹1,060 and accumulate at ₹1,050. Keep the stop-loss at ₹980 for the target of ₹1,180.
RIL (₹946.7) surged breaking above the key resistance level of ₹937 last week. The stock was up 2.6 per cent last week. The region between ₹937 and ₹935 will now serve as a strong support for the stock in the near-term. As long as the stock remains above this support zone, there is a strong likelihood of it rallying to test the crucial resistance level of ₹960 in the coming days. Whether it breaks above ₹960 or not will then determine the next move. A strong break above ₹960 will boost the momentum. Such a break will pave the way for RIL to target the psychological ₹1,000 mark going forward. It will also wipe out the threat of the double-top reversal pattern formation on the chart that we have been reiterating in this column over the last few weeks. But if the stock reverses lower from ₹960 it can fall to ₹940 or ₹935 again. The possibility of the stock extending its downmove towards ₹910 or even ₹900 cannot be ruled out. In such a scenario, RIL can remain in the ₹880-₹960 sideways range for some more time.
After a strong surge for three consecutive weeks, the rally in Tata Steel (₹771) paused last week. The stock was stuck in a narrow range between ₹760 and ₹780 last week. Resistance is around ₹785. As long as the stock remains below this hurdle, an intermediate dip to ₹745 or ₹740 cannot be ruled out. Further fall below ₹740 looks less probable at the moment. A range bound move with a bullish bias between ₹740 and ₹785 can be seen for some time in such a scenario. An eventual break and a decisive weekly close above ₹785 will boost the momentum. Such a break will take the stock higher to the next targets of ₹830 and ₹850. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹930 and ₹950 over the long-term. Investors can hold the long positions. Retain the stop-loss at ₹640 and revise it higher to ₹680 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹800. As mentioned last week, investors can consider booking partial profits around ₹900 levels. A trendline support at ₹710 and the 100-day moving average at ₹694 are the key supports for Tata Steel. The outlook will turn negative only if it declines below ₹694 decisively, which looks unlikely at the moment.

74,2018-03-04,ITC,"Five of top-10 companies lose Rs 26,641 cr in m-cap, SBI takes biggest hit 
 Five of the 10 most valued Indian companies saw a combined erosion of Rs 26,641.48 crore in market valuation last week, with the country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) taking the steepest hit. The other firms which witnessed a decline in their market capitalisation (m-cap) for the week ended Thursday were TCS, ITC, ONGC and HDFC Bank. On the other hand, RIL, Maruti Suzuki, HDFC, Infosys and HUL finished the week with gains. 
The m-cap of SBI dived by Rs 11,696.44 crore to Rs 2,26,634.57 crore. The valuation of TCS plunged Rs 7,618.87 crore to Rs 5,81,388.28 crore and that of ITC tanked Rs 6,535.69 crore to Rs 3,21,521.62 crore. ONGC’s m-cap dropped to Rs 2,43,253.97 crore, a decline of Rs 577.50 crore, while HDFC Bank saw its valuation dip by Rs 212.98 crore to Rs 4,87,043.44 crore.
 In contrast, the m-cap of RIL surged by Rs 8,677.76 crore to Rs 6,00,285.50 crore. The valuation of Maruti Suzuki India soared by Rs 5,159.53 crore to Rs 2,68,129.28 crore and that of HDFC jumped by Rs 3,819.56 crore to Rs 2,99,923.16 crore. The m-cap of Infosys increased by Rs 1,004.69 crore to Rs 2,53,411.72 crore, while that of HUL spurted by Rs 573.59 crore to Rs 2,86,934.10 crore. 
In the ranking of top-10 firms, RIL stood at the numero uno position, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, ITC, HDFC, HUL, Maruti Suzuki India, Infosys, ONGC and SBI. Over the last week, the flagship Sensex recorded a fall of 95.21 points or 0.27 per cent."
73,2018-03-07,ITC,"ITC to ramp up fresh vegetables, fruits supply in seven metros 
Diversified company ITC, which recently forayed into the packaged fresh fruits and vegetable segment, plans to ramp up the distribution of its brand Farmland in the top seven metros in the next two to three years. 
The company had last year, launched packaged potatoes in four variants in Delhi and recently expanded this range to apples with the assurance of “no wax” under the Farmland brand. 
S Sivakumar, Group Head-Agri & IT Businesses, ITC, said: “The potential in the packaged fresh fruits and vegetables is huge. We are focussing our efforts on development of this category. We will add more products under brand Farmland as there are more vegetables and fruits lined up for launch. We will expand the distribution of Farmland to the top seven metros in the next two to three years.” He said that the company is working on adding several other vegetables to the brand, including green vegetables which will require cold chain infrastructure. 
In terms of packaged fresh fruits, the company is experimenting with fruits such as mangoes, pomegranates and bananas.
“We will also look at adding more variants of potatoes and apples this year too. Since we have developed the supply chain and channel strategy in Delhi, we will initially focus on Delhi before adding more cities,” he added.
Under brand ITC MasterChef, the company had earlier launched frozen prawns and spices and has recently added dehydrated onions. 
“As of now, we have launched ITC MasterChef Smart Onions which are dehydrated red onions for institutional consumers. We will look at launching it in smaller packs for the B2C segment in the next 6-12 months,” Sivakumar added.
Replying to a query on the impact on private players due to higher MSP on commodities such as wheat, he said: “The national priority of raising farmers’ income will mean some degree of higher pricing for consumers. Therefore, private players will play a key role in bringing in efficiencies with more food processing so that farmers get more value for their produce and consumers do not get penalised with higher prices. ”"
78,2018-03-09,ITC,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI fell over 3 per cent last week. The fall has dragged the stock well below the key support level of ₹315. A cluster of resistances in between ₹315 and ₹320 can cap the upside in the coming days. The price action last week has turned the short-term outlook bearish. Also, a complex head and shoulder reversal pattern on the daily chart increases the likelihood of the stock falling in the coming days. Traders holding long positions can book loss and exit at current levels. The stock can fall to ₹300 initially. A break below ₹300 can drag it further lower to ₹296 and ₹293 or even ₹290 thereafter. Traders with high risk appetite can go short at current levels and on rallies at ₹314. Keep the stop-loss at ₹317 for the target of ₹294.
Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹306 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹301. The downside pressure will ease only if the stock breaks above ₹315 decisively. Such a break can take it to ₹320 initially. However, the stock has to breach ₹320 for the outlook to turn positive.
ITC was stuck in a narrow range over the last few weeks. The stock has been in between the 21-day moving average support at ₹260 and the 100-day moving average resistance at ₹267 over the last three weeks. A breakout on either side of ₹260 or ₹267 will determine the next trend.
If ITC manages to surpass ₹267 decisively, it can move up to ₹272 initially. It will also be an initial sign that the downtrend that has been in place since July 2017 is being reversed. A further rally breaking above ₹272 can then target ₹277 or ₹280, confirming the trend reversal. On the other hand, if ITC remains below ₹267 and breaks below ₹260, it can fall to ₹257 — a key short-term support level. A strong break below ₹257 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹252 thereafter. Traders who have taken long positions on dips last week at ₹261 can hold it. Accumulate longs at ₹258. Retain the stop-loss at ₹254 for the target of ₹275. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹270.
Infosys had a volatile 2017. At one point of time the stock had tumbled about 15 per cent. But it recovered all the losses and has gained 3 per cent in 2017. . This recovery rally, which has taken the stock above the crucial ₹1,030-₹1,035 resistance zone, is signalling a trend reversal and the worst seems to be over. Immediate support is in between ₹1,035 and ₹1,030 and then the next significant support is around ₹1,000. As long as the stock remains above ₹1,000, the outlook is positive. A rally to ₹1,070 is likely in the short term, which will confirm the trend reversal. It will pave the way for the stock to target ₹1,350 levels. Inability to break above ₹1,070 initially can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹1,050 and ₹1,035.
Investors can hold the long positions and accumulate on dips at ₹1,015. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if the stock declines below ₹1,000. Subsequent targets are ₹980 and ₹965. But such a fall below ₹1,000 is less likely as dips to ₹1,000 may find fresh buyers coming into the market.
RIL, which has surged a whopping 71 per cent in 2017, witnessed muted trading in the final week of the year. The stock managed to sustain above ₹900, but remained in a narrow range all through the week. Support is at ₹912 and immediate resistance is at ₹935. A breakout on either side of these levels will give a cue on the next trend. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹935 can take RIL higher to ₹960 — a crucial resistance that has been capping the upside since October. Inability to break above ₹960 can pull the stock lower to ₹935 or even further down. But a strong break above ₹960 can target the psychological ₹1,000 level.
On the other hand, if RIL breaks below ₹912 in the coming days, it can fall to ₹896 initially. A further break below ₹896 can drag it to ₹880 — a crucial short-term support level. As reiterated over the last couple of weeks, a strong break below ₹880 will indicate a double top pattern on the chart and can drag the stock to ₹854 or even lower thereafter.
Year 2017 was a robust one for Tata Steel. The stock surged a whopping 87 per cent last year. The strong 3 per cent rally last week has taken the stock well above a key resistance level of ₹715, which has been capping the upside over the last several weeks. This marks the end of the sideways consolidation and also the resumption of the overall uptrend. Resistance is at ₹743, which was tested last week.
A strong break and a decisive weekly close above this hurdle is needed for the stock to extend its rally. Such a break will boost the momentum for the stock to target ₹850 over the medium term. But if Tata Steel continues to remain below ₹743, it can dip to ₹715 or ₹710 in the coming days. An immediate break below ₹710 is unlikely at the moment. So, as long as the stock remains below ₹743, a range-bound move between ₹710 and ₹743 can be seen for some time. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions. Accumulate on dips at ₹720. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹615.

SBI (₹253.1)
 As expected, SBI fell breaking below the 200-week moving average (₹260) support last week. The stock tumbled to a low of ₹244.4, but managed to recover some of the loss before closing 3.6 per cent lower for the week. The crucial support at ₹245 is holding well as of now. Since the stock has been falling continuously over the last few weeks, as long as it sustains above ₹245, a corrective rally in the short term cannot be ruled out. A strong break above the immediate resistance in the ₹258-₹260 zone can trigger this corrective rally, targeting ₹270 in the short term on the back of profit booking. But if SBI fails to breach ₹260 and remains below it, a revisit of ₹245 is possible. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹245 and ₹260 can be seen for some time. The stock will come under renewed pressure if it breaks below ₹245 decisively. Such a break can take it to ₹238 initially. Further break below ₹238 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹205 or ₹200 over the medium term.
 








 
 
ITC (₹259.4)
ITC fell breaking below the key support level of ₹262 last week. Though the stock has bounced from its intra-week low of ₹253.4, the muted price action of this recovery move indicates lack of strength. Strong resistance is in the ₹263-₹266 region. ITC should surpass ₹266 decisively to ease the downside pressure. In such a scenario, the stock can rally to ₹270 and ₹275 again. But the indicators on the chart suggest a lower possibility of the stock breaking above the ₹263-₹266 resistance zone. Immediate support is at ₹257. A strong break below it can drag the stock lower to ₹250 in the coming days. A break below ₹250 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending towards ₹244. Further fall below ₹244 looks less probable at the moment. Short-term traders can go short on rallies at ₹262 and ₹265 with a stop-loss at ₹268 for the target of ₹252. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹259 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹256. Long-term investors, on the other hand can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220.
Infosys (₹1,163.4)
Though, Infosys is stuck in a sideways range for more than two weeks the price action keeps the bias positive. Inability to break above ₹1,169 can keep the stock range-bound between ₹1,130 and ₹1,169 for some time. But a decisive break above ₹1,169 can boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹1,200 initially. It will also increase the possibility of the stock breaching the psychological ₹1,200 mark and targeting ₹1,250 or even higher levels over the medium term. The 21-day moving average at ₹1,138 and a trend line at ₹1,130 are the key supports to watch. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below ₹1,130 decisively. Such a break, though less likely, will increase the possibility of the stock falling towards ₹1,110 and ₹1,100 in the short term. The region between ₹1,100 and ₹1,085 is a strong support for Infosys. A strong fall breaking below ₹1,085 is unlikely as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at lower levels and limit the downside. Both long and medium-term investors can hold the long positions.
RIL (₹912) 
 RIL fell sharply last week after failing to extend its up-move beyond the key resistance at ₹960. The stock tumbled over 6 per cent intra-week and made a low of ₹888.3. However, it managed to bounce from this low recovering some of the loss and closed 3.7 per cent lower for the week. The broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range within which the stock has been trading over the last few months, remains intact. The immediate outlook is unclear. Cluster of moving average (21-, 100- and 55-day moving average) resistances are poised in between ₹922 and ₹928. If RIL manages to break above this resistance cluster, it can rally again towards ₹950 and ₹960 — the upper end of the range. But inability to break above the ₹922-₹928 resistance zone and a pull-back move in the coming days can keep the stock under pressure. In such a scenario, RIL can fall below ₹900 and test ₹880 and ₹870 — the lower end of the range. Traders can continue to stay out of this stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges.
Tata Steel (₹605.6)
Contrary to our expectation, Tata Steel tumbled breaking below ₹630 last week. The stock plummeted 10 per cent in the past week and the stop-loss levels on the long positions have been breached. The uptrend that has been in place since 2016 is under threat now and initial signs of a trend reversal are emanating on the charts. The stock has closed below the 200-day moving average for the first time in two years. Cluster of resistances in between ₹635 and ₹650 can cap the upside. Intermediate bounces may find fresh sellers coming into the market at higher levels in the above-mentioned resistance zone. As long as the stock remains below ₹650, the outlook will remain bearish and a fall to ₹580 cannot be ruled out. A strong break below ₹580 will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹555. Short-term traders can go short on rallies at ₹630 and ₹650. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹685 for the target of ₹560. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹605 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹585."

FMCG major, ITC Ltd is piloting a social agro-forestry project in the Malkangiri district of Odisha by distributing fast-growing Eucalyptus and subabul saplings to farmers. The project is expected to help shore up raw material (pulpwood) sourcing for the company’s paperboard factory at Bhadrachalam in Telengana.
 
According to Sanjiv Puri, CEO, ITC Ltd, the plan is to take up the social forestry project in Odisha to 50,000 hectares “over a period of time”.
 
The move is also in line with the company’s import substitution strategy that is: reducing dependence on import of pulp. 
 
“We have begun a social forestry project at Malkangiri and would like to scale it up over a period of time. Apart from providing sustainable livelihoods to farmers, it would also help in being a source of pulpwood to our paperboard unit in Telangana,” he said on the sidelines of the eastern regional meeting of the CII here in the city.
 
The Saberi river bridge connecting Chattisgarh and Hyderabad has made the Malkangiri district of Odisha an important catchment area that can aid raw material procurement for ITC’s paperboard unit at Bhadrachalam.
 
In fact, ITC under its afforestation initiative has worked extensively with farmers to have a green cover encompassing over 6,80,000 acres. The programme has generated over124 million person-days of employment (among poor tribals, marginal farmers and farm workers)."

SBI is vulnerable for further fall (₹234.6)
The ongoing scams and frauds in the banking sector is keeping stocks in this space under pressure. SBI tumbled about 7 per cent breaking below the crucial support level of ₹241. The fall last week indicates that the downtrend is intact and is gaining strength. Key resistances are at ₹241 and ₹250, which can cap the upside in the short term. A fall to ₹226 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement support level is likely in the short-term. A bounce back-move to ₹241 from ₹226 cannot be ruled out. However, the upside is expected to be capped as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels and cap the upside. An eventual break below ₹226 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or 190 over the medium term. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go short at current levels and at ₹240. Keep the stop-loss at ₹248 for the target of ₹205. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹232 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹227. The downside pressure will ease only if SBI breaches ₹250 decisive. But that looks unlikely in the near term.
Short-term view is negative for ITC (₹256.3)
Weakness in the broader markets dragged ITC below the key support level of ₹258 in the final trading session of the week. The ₹258-₹259 resistance region can cap the upside in the near term. As long as the stock trades below ₹259, a fall to ₹251 or ₹250 is likely. Short-term traders can go short at the current levels and at ₹258. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹259.5 for the target of ₹251. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹255 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹253. A bounce-back thereafter from ₹250 can ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹257 or ₹258 again. But if ITC declines below ₹250 decisively, the downmove can then extend to ₹247 or ₹244 over the medium term. But such a fall will be a good buying opportunity for the medium and long-term investors. Cluster of supports are poised between ₹245 and ₹230, which can halt the downtrend. A strong upward reversal thereafter will mark the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend. Long-term investors can hold the long positions and accumulate at ₹247. Retain the stop-loss at ₹220.
Infosys consolidated within its uptrend (₹1,167.4)
The ₹1,140-₹1,130 region continues to provide strong support for Infosys. The stock made a low of ₹1,140 and has reversed higher from there. The ₹1,130-₹1,200 sideways range remains intact. Intermediate resistance is at ₹1,177. A break above it can take Infosys higher to ₹1,200. Inability to break above ₹1,200 can pull the stock lower and continue to keep it in the ₹1,130-₹1,200 range. A strong break above ₹1,200 is needed for Infosys to gain fresh momentum. Such a break can take it higher to ₹1,210. Further break above ₹1,210 will see the stock rallying to ₹1,250 and even higher thereafter. On the other hand, Infosys will come under pressure if it breaks below ₹1,130. Such a break will see an intermediate dip to ₹1,100. Further fall below ₹1,100 is less probable as fresh buyers may emerge at lower levels. Also, the overall bias is bullish for Infosys to breach ₹1,200 and extend its upmove over a medium and long term. So any intermediate fall below ₹1,130 will be a good buying opportunity. Both medium- and long-term investors can hold the long positions.
Immediate outlook is unclear for RIL (₹892.8)
RIL was stuck in a narrow range in the past week. The stock was range-bound between ₹887 and ₹911 and has closed on a slightly negative note. The immediate outlook is unclear. Traders can stay out of the stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges. As long as the stock remains below ₹900, a fall to test the crucial support at ₹870 is likely. A break below ₹870 can drag RIL to ₹860 and ₹850 thereafter. But if the stock manages to sustain above the support at ₹870 and reverses higher, the downside pressure will ease. Such a reversal will indicate that the broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range is intact. The stock has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time since last November. Intermediate resistance is at ₹900 and cluster of resistances are poised between ₹920 and ₹930. A strong break above ₹930 will pave way for a fresh rally to ₹960. RIL will gain fresh bullish momentum only if it breaks above ₹960 decisively. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹1,000 or even higher thereafter.
Downtrend intact for Tata Steel (₹566.6)
As expected, Tata Steel extended its fall for the third consecutive week. The stock was down 5.6 per cent last week. Tata Steel has tumbled 16 per cent over the last three weeks. Immediate support is at ₹550. But the stock is vulnerable to break below this level in the coming days as the downtrend has gathered momentum and any upmove would find fresh selling interest coming into the stock. Such a break can drag it to ₹540 or ₹530. The region between ₹540-₹530 is a strong medium-term support. Since the stock has been falling continuously over the last few weeks, a relief rally from the ₹540-₹530 support zone cannot be ruled out. An upward reversal from this support zone can take the stock higher to ₹585 or even ₹600. But if Tata Steel breaks below ₹530 decisively, it can tumble to ₹500 or even ₹480 over the medium term. Traders can hold the short positions. Revise the stop-loss lower to the level of ₹585. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹575 as soon as the stock dips to ₹555. Book profits at ₹545."

Near-term outlook is unclear for SBI (₹250.1)
Contrary to expectations of a fall, SBI witnessed a sharp bounce in the past week. The near-term outlook is unclear. The price action will be key in deciding the next move. Key resistance is in the ₹257-260 region. If SBI manages to breach ₹260 decisively, the downside pressure will ease. Such a break will trigger a relief rally towards ₹271 — a 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level — initially on the back of short covering. Further break above ₹271 will see the up-move extending towards ₹283 — a trendline as well as the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance level. A rally beyond ₹283 is unlikely as the upside is expected to be capped at this level. SBI will come under pressure again only if it breaks below ₹240 decisively. Such a break will bring the bears back into the stock. It will signal the resumption of the overall downtrend and increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹200 and ₹190 over the medium term. Traders can stay out of the stock and wait for a clear trend and a trade signal to emerge.
ITC can remain range bound (₹255.9)
ITC was volatile in the past week. Though it opened with a wide gap-down, it managed to reverse sharply higher closing the gap and surged to a high of ₹265.75 on the same day. However, ITC failed to sustain and came off from this high again, giving back most of the gains made during the week. It closed on a flat note. A dip to revisit the crucial support at ₹250 is likely in the near term. If the stock manages to bounce again from ₹250, it can move higher and remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. But if ITC declines below ₹250 decisively, a fresh fall to ₹247 or ₹244 is possible. As mentioned last week, a cluster of supports poised between ₹245 and ₹230 can halt the current downtrend. A strong upward reversal thereafter will mark the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend. So, investors holding the long positions can accumulate at ₹247 and retain the stop-loss at ₹220. A strong break above ₹265 will bring fresh bullish momentum and take ITC higher to ₹270 and ₹275 thereafter.
Short-term view is negative for Infosys (₹1,134.4)
Infosys tumbled 2.8 per cent last week. The short-term outlook has turned negative after last week’s strong fall. Immediate resistances are at ₹1,140 and ₹1,145. A break above ₹1,145 can ease the downside pressure and take the stock up to ₹1,160. Further break above ₹1,160 will increase the possibility of the stock revisiting ₹1,200 levels. If Infosys remains below ₹1,145, it can be under pressure. While below ₹1,145, a fall to ₹1,090 or ₹1,085 is likely in the short term. Further fall below ₹1,085 is less probable now. But if Infosys breaks below ₹1,085, it will indicate a double-top formation on the chart. This will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹1,050 or even ₹1,030 over the medium term. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go short at current levels. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,165 for the target of ₹1,085. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹1,120 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹1,110. However, the fall to ₹1,050-₹1,030 will be a good buying opportunity for long-term investors.
RIL hovers above a crucial support (₹882.8)
RIL seems to lack strength to breach the psychological level of ₹900. The stock made a high of ₹910 only to close 1.1 per cent lower for the week. A crucial support is at ₹870, which is likely to be tested. If RIL manages to bounce from there, the downside pressure will ease. It will keep the broader ₹870-960 sideways range intact and increase the possibility of the stock bouncing back to ₹900 and ₹920 initially. Further break above ₹920 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹960 — the upper end of the range in the short term. On the other hand, if RIL breaks below ₹870, it can fall to ₹860 or ₹855. A trend line as well as the 200-day moving average supports are poised between ₹860 and ₹855. A strong break below ₹855 will bring renewed pressure for the stock. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹820 or even ₹800 on the back of profit-booking. This down move below ₹855 could be swift as stop-loss orders are likely to be triggered below this level.
Tata Steel can consolidate sideways (₹570.9)
Tata Steel managed to sustain above the key support level of ₹550 last week. However, the price action on the chart reflects that the stock lacks strong buying interest. It made a high of ₹598.85 and has come off from it. A revisit to ₹550 is likely in the near term. A bounce from ₹550 can take it back to ₹600 again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹550 and ₹600 can be seen for some time. If Tata Steel manages to breach ₹600, the downside pressure can ease and a rally to ₹635 is possible. Further break above ₹635 looks unlikely at the moment as the bias continues to remain bearish. As such, an eventual break below ₹550 can take Tata Steel lower to ₹535. A strong break below ₹535 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or ₹500 over the medium term. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go short. Keep the stop-loss at ₹605 for the target of ₹515. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹555 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹545."
68,2018-04-08,ITC,"Weekly trading guide
SBI forms a bullish reversal pattern (₹259.8)
After an initial struggle, SBI managed to breach decisively the 21-day moving average (₹250) resistance towards the end of the week. The stock was up 3.8 per cent last week and has closed on a strong note. The level of ₹250 will now be a good support for the stock. The price action on the chart since March indicates the formation of an inverted head and shoulder pattern. This is a bullish reversal pattern. The neckline resistance of this pattern is at ₹262. A strong break above ₹262 will confirm this pattern and take SBI higher to ₹268 initially. Further break above ₹268 will pave way for the next targets of ₹275 and ₹280. On the other hand, if SBI fails to rise past ₹262 in the coming days, it can fall back towards ₹250 levels again. A break below ₹250 can then drag the stock lower to ₹240 levels again. Traders can go long on a break above ₹262. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹252 for the target of ₹280. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹268.
Near-term view is positive for ITC (₹260.6)
ITC remained broadly in a sideways range all through last week. The near-term view is positive. A rise to test the ₹264-₹266 resistance region is possible in the coming days. Whether ITC breaks above ₹266 or not will be key in deciding the next move. A strong break above ₹266 will bring renewed strength to the stock. Such a break can then trigger a fresh rally to ₹274. The rally to ₹274 will also mark the end of the downtrend that has been in place since February. On the other hand, if ITC fails to breach ₹266 and reverses lower in the coming days, it can fall to ₹260 or ₹257 again. The region between ₹257 and ₹255 is a key near-term support. A bounce from this support zone can take the stock ITC higher again and keep it range-bound between ₹255 and ₹266 for some time. But if ITC declines below ₹255, it can fall to test the crucial support level of ₹250. A break below it can drag it to ₹250. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at the level of ₹220.
Short-term outlook is negative for Infosys (₹1,129.3)
Infosys remained subdued and range-bound between ₹1,120 and ₹1,150. Key resistances are at ₹1,147 and ₹1,155. As long as the stock remains below these resistances, a fall to ₹1,090 cannot be ruled out. A bounce from ₹1,090 will ease the pressure and take Infosys higher to ₹1,150 levels again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range bound between ₹1,090 and ₹1,200 for sometime. But if Infosys breaks below ₹1,090, a fall to ₹1,050 or even ₹1,030 is possible over the medium-term. But further fall below the ₹1,050-₹1,030 support zone is unlikely as fresh buyers can emerge in the market. As mentioned last week, a fall to ₹1,050-₹1,030, if seen, will be a good buying opportunity for long-term investors. Traders who have taken short positions last week can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,165 for a revised target of ₹1,105. Move the stop-loss lower to ₹1,125 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹1,115. Medium and long-term investors can hold the long positions.
Near-term view is positive for RIL (₹909.7)
RIL snapped its four-week fall. The stock surged 2.8 per cent last week. Key resistances are at ₹921 and ₹928, which are likely to be tested in the near term. Inability to breach these hurdles can pull the stock lower to ₹900 or ₹890 levels again. But if RIL manages to breach ₹928 decisively, it can gain momentum. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹960 over the short term. A strong break above ₹928 will boost the momentum. Such a break can take RIL higher to ₹960 in the short term. The level of ₹960 is a crucial resistance for RIL. A strong break above it will pave way for the next targets of ₹1,000 and ₹1,020 over the medium. But if RIL reverses lower from ₹960, it can fall back to ₹920 or ₹900 levels again. In such a scenario, the broader ₹870-₹960 range will remain intact. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go long at current levels. Keep the stop-loss at ₹885 for the target of ₹955. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹920 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹935.
Resistance to cap the upside in Tata Steel (₹586.3)
Tata Steel remained lower but in a narrow range in the past week. The stock has been consolidating over the last couple of weeks within its overall downtrend. The level of ₹600 is a key near-term resistance. A strong break above it is needed for the downside pressure to ease. Such a break can trigger a corrective rally towards ₹630. But the upside is expected to be capped as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels. As such, a further rally beyond ₹630 looks less probable now as the bias continues to remain bearish on the stock. A revisit of ₹550 is likely in the coming days. A break below ₹550 can take the stock lower to ₹535 initially. Further break below ₹535 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or even ₹500 over the medium term. Traders who have taken short positions can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹605 for the target of ₹515. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹555 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹545.

Resistance caps the upside in SBI (₹251.2)
SBI failed to breach the key resistance level of ₹262 last week. The stock reversed sharply lower after making a high of ₹265.25 and closed 3.3 per cent down for the week. Immediate support is at ₹248. If SBI manages to sustain above this support, a bounce-back move to ₹262 is possible again. 
 








 
 
A strong break above ₹262 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹270 initially. Further break above ₹270 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹283 or ₹285. On the other hand, if SBI declines below the immediate support at ₹248 in the coming days, it can come under more pressure. Such a break can drag it to the crucial support level of ₹240. Whether SBI breaks below ₹240 or not will decide the next move. A bounce from ₹240 can keep it range-bound between ₹240 and ₹260 for some time. But a strong break and a decisive close below ₹240 can bring renewed pressure on the stock. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or ₹190 over the medium term.
ITC may remain range-bound (₹260.8)
ITC rallied as expected to test the resistance at ₹266. But it failed to sustain higher and came-off sharply from ₹268.2 and closed the week on a flat note. Inability to bounce from the current levels can keep the stock under pressure. Support is at ₹258. A break below it can drag the stock lower to ₹255 or even ₹250 in the short term. The region between ₹251 and ₹250 is a crucial support that has been limiting the downside since November. An upward reversal from this support region can take ITC higher to ₹260 and ₹265 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below ₹250 decisively. Such a break can take the stock lower to ₹245 or ₹244 initially. Further break below ₹244 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹235 or even lower. On the other hand, if ITC bounces from the immediate support at ₹258, it can move up to ₹265 or ₹267. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220
Infosys maintains its uptrend (₹1,169)
Infosys snapped its three-week fall as the psychological support at ₹1,100 held well. The stock made a low of ₹1,105 and surged to close the week 3.3 per cent higher. This upward reversal keeps the ₹1,100-₹1,200 sideways range intact. Infosys has been stuck in this range since February. As long as the stock remains above the ₹1,150-₹1,140 support zone, the possibility is high of it extending its upmove towards ₹1,200. Inability to break above ₹1,200 can drag Infosys lower to ₹1,150 or even lower. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound for some time. But if Infosys manages to breach ₹1,200 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹1,250 or ₹1,270. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 or even higher levels over the long term. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below the ₹1,100-₹1,090 support
Key resistance ahead for RIL (₹938.85)
RIL extended its rally for the second consecutive week. The stock surged 3.2 per cent in the past week. The near-term view remains positive. Support is in the ₹925-₹920 region. The stock can extend its current upmove and test the crucial resistance level of ₹960 in the coming days. Inability to break above ₹960 and a subsequent pull-back move will take the stock lower to ₹920. In such a scenario, the broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range will remain intact. RIL has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time. On the other hand, the stock will gain fresh momentum if it manages to breach ₹960 decisively. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹1,000 and ₹1,020 in the coming weeks. The outlook will turn negative only if the stock breaks below ₹870. But such a break look less probable at the moment. Traders who have taken long positions last week can hold it with a revised stop-loss at ₹920 and target of ₹955. Move the stop-loss further higher to ₹938 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹945.
Tata Steel lacks strength (₹593.3)
Tata Steel inched higher for the third consecutive week. The stock was up 1.5 per cent. Immediate support is at ₹588 — the 21-day moving average that is likely to be tested in the initial part of the week. An upward reversal from there will see the current rally extending towards ₹620 or even ₹630 in the coming weeks. Further break above ₹630 looks less likely now as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels. A pull-back fromthe level of ₹630 can drag the stock to ₹600 or even lower levels thereafter. On the other hand, if Tata Steel declines below the 21-day moving average (₹588) support, it can fall to ₹570 or ₹560. Further break below ₹560 will then increase the likelihood of the stock falling towards ₹550 or ₹545. The region between ₹550 and ₹545 is a key medium-term support. A break below ₹545 can take the stock lower to ₹535 initially. Further break below ₹535 will then increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or ₹500 over the medium term."

 Seven of the 10 most valued Indian companies together added ₹ 69,917.79 crore in market valuation last week, with RIL emerging as the biggest gainer.
 While Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), ITC, HUL, HDFC, Infosys and Kotak Mahindra Bank saw rise in their market valuation for the week ended Friday, HDFC Bank, Maruti Suzuki India and ONGC suffered losses. 
Among gainers, RIL’s valuation zoomed ₹42,255.18 crore to ₹6,30,185.08 crore. The market capitalisation (m-cap) of TCS jumped ₹9,265.16 crore to ₹6,61,348.08 crore and that of Kotak Mahindra Bank soared ₹6,513.29 crore to ₹2,26,510.88 crore.
 IT bellwether TCS on Thursday became the first Indian company to close the trading session with over USD 100 billion market valuation. HDFC’s m-cap advanced by ₹4,390.79 crore to ₹3,11,352.38 crore and that of ITC gained ₹4,027.42 crore to ₹3,40,804.94 crore.

SBI (₹250.9)
SBI rose 3.7 per cent last week. This rally has eased the downside pressure and turned the near-term view positive. So, traders can exit and book loss on the short positions taken a couple of weeks back. An immediate resistance is in the ₹253-₹254 region, which is likely to be tested in the early part of the week. A break above ₹254 can take the stock higher to ₹259 and ₹260. Further break above ₹260 can extend the up-move to ₹264 and ₹265. The level of ₹265 is a crucial short-term resistance. Inability to breach this hurdle can pull the stock lower to ₹255 and ₹250. In such a scenario, SBI can remain range-bound between ₹230 and ₹265 for some time. If SBI breaks above ₹265 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹270 or even ₹280 levels in the coming weeks. It will also signal that the downtrend that has been in place since November last year has come to an end.










 ITC (₹283.9) 
 ITC reversed higher last week and was up 2.3 per cent. The 55-week moving average at ₹277 has been providing strong support for the stock over the last two weeks, keeping the overall bullish outlook intact. However, a crucial resistance cluster is ahead in the ₹285-₹290 region. ITC has to breach above ₹290 decisively to keep the current uptrend intact. Price action on the charts suggests that the possibility is high of the stock breaching ₹290 and targeting ₹295 initially. Further break above ₹295 will take the stock up to ₹305. On the other hand, if ITC reverses lower from ₹290 , it can fall to ₹280 or ₹275 — a key short-term support. An immediate break below ₹275 looks less probable at the moment. If the stock manages to sustain above ₹275, a range-bound move between ₹275 and ₹290 can be seen in the short term. If ITC breaks below ₹275, a fall to ₹270 or ₹268 is possible. Long-term investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220.










 Infosys (₹1,181) 
 Infosys remained subdued and closed on a mixed note last week. The 21-day moving average at ₹1,167 had provided strong support for the stock. As long as Infosys remains above this support, It can break above the crucial ₹1,200-₹1,205 resistance region. Such a break will mark the end of the prolonged sideways consolidation phase. The stock has been stuck in the band between ₹1,100 and ₹1,200 since January. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,205 will take the stock higher to revisit the previous highs of ₹1,278. Such a rally will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 and ₹1,375 levels over the medium term. The near-term view will turn negative if the stock declines below the 21-day moving average. In such a scenario, a fall to ₹1,140 or ₹1,135 levels is possible. Further break below ₹1,135 will see the down-move extending to ₹1,100 . Both medium- and long-term investors can hold their long positions.










RIL (₹988.5)
RIL managed to reverse higher in the past week and has recovered most of the loss made in the week earlier. The stock surged 3.6 per cent last week. Though the weekly chart gives a mixed picture, the daily candles leave the near-term outlook positive. A test of the psychological resistance level of ₹1,000 is possible. A strong break above ₹1,000 will take the stock higher to ₹1,030 . Whether RIL breaks above ₹1,030 or not will decide the next move. Inability to break above ₹1,030 can pull the stock lower to ₹1,000. A break below ₹1,000, will see the down-move extending towards ₹980 or ₹970. On the other hand, if RIL manages to break above ₹1,030 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum and rally towards ₹1,085. The 21-day moving average at ₹959 is a key support. The outlook will turn negative only if RIL declines below this support. A strong break below ₹959 will then increase the possibility of the stock falling to ₹930 or even ₹900 .










 Tata Steel (₹606)
Tata Steel has risen, breaking above the key psychological resistance level of ₹600 last week. This has eased the downside pressure and is also slightly turning the bias positive. The key resistance is in the ₹615-620 region is likely to be tested in the coming days. Traders who have taken short position last week on rallies at ₹590 and ₹596 can exit and book loss at current level. Whether Tata Steel breaks above ₹620 or not will be key in deciding the next move. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹620 ease the downside pressure. Such a break will take the stock higher to ₹635 or even to ₹650. This move above ₹620 could be swift on the back of short covering. On the other hand, if Tata Steel reverses lower from ₹620, it can fall to ₹600 initially. If it manages to bounce from this psychological support, a range-bound move between ₹600 and ₹620 can be seen for some time. But a break below ₹600 can drag the stock lower to ₹585."

Consumer company Hindustan Unilever briefly surpassed ITC in market capitalisation. HUL momentarily crossed rival ITC Ltd to become the fourth-largest company on the National Stock Exchange.
Hindustan Unilever's shares surged as much as 2.2 per cent to a record Rs 1,604.50. At Friday's high, HUL's market cap was Rs 3,47,300 crore ($51.01 billion) vs ITC's market cap of Rs 3,47,200 crore.
HUL stock broke above a resistance at Rs 1,595, the 50 per cent Fibonacci projection level of the uptrend from the low of December 23, 2016 to the high of January 30, 2018. The breakout was supported by volume; the stock's 5-day average volume was 97 per cent higher than its 30-day average volume.
A close above Rs 1,595 may lead to gains towards Rs 1,669, the 61.8 per cent projection level. The stock was up 55.5 pct in the last one year as of Thursday, outperforming ITC's nearly 6 per cent gain in the same period. Nifty FMCG index rose 17.4 per cent in the past one year."

 SBI (₹239.2)
SBI began the week on a positive note, but it was short-lived. The stock touched a high of ₹257.2 and came off sharply from there to close 4.7 per cent lower for the week. The near-term view is bearish. A fall to test the crucial support level of ₹231 is likely. If SBI manages to bounce from ₹231, the downside pressure would ease. A relief rally to ₹250 or ₹255 is possible then. Also, a range-bound move between ₹231 and ₹255 is possible for some time in such a scenario. But if SBI breaks below ₹231 decisively, it can come under renewed pressure. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or ₹195 over the medium term. The region around ₹195 is a strong long-term support which can halt the downtrend that has been in place since November last year. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go short at current levels and on rallies at ₹245. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹265 for the target of ₹200. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹240 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹225.










 ITC (₹282.1)
ITC was volatile last week. The stock has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹276 and ₹290 over the last three weeks. Last week’s candle on the weekly chart reflects indecisiveness in the market. This leaves the short-term outlook unclear for the stock. A breakout on either side of ₹276 or ₹290 will decide the next move. If ITC declines below ₹276, it can fall to test the ₹269-₹267 support region. A bounce from this support zone will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹280 and ₹285 again. But a strong break below ₹267can drag the stock lower to ₹260 or even ₹255. On the other hand, if ITC manages to sustain above ₹276 in the coming days and breaches ₹290, it can move higher to ₹296 initially. Inability to break above ₹296 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹289. But a strong break above ₹296 will see the stock rallying to ₹303 or ₹305. Such a rally will also mark the end of the downtrend that has been in place since last July. Long-term investors can hold the long positions.










 Infosys (₹1,183.7)
Infosys has been testing the psychological level of ₹1,200 over the last four consecutive weeks. However, the stock seems to be lacking fresh buyers to take it decisively above ₹1,200. It has been facing strong resistance around ₹1,210. A strong break above this hurdle is needed for Infosys to gain fresh momentum. Such a break will see Infosys testing the previous highs of ₹1,278 levels. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 and ₹1,375 levels over the medium term. On the other hand, if Infosys continues to remain below ₹1,200, a fall to ₹1,160 is possible in the near term. It will keep the broader ₹1,100-₹1,200 sideways range intact. The stock has been stuck in this range since January. Further break below ₹1,160 can drag the stock to ₹1,140 or ₹1,135. A bounce from ₹1,135 can trigger a relief rally to ₹1,160 or ₹1,170. But a strong break below ₹1,135 will see Infosys falling towards ₹1,100. Further fall below ₹1,100 is unlikely. Both medium- and long-term investors can hold the long positions.










 RIL (₹933.4)
RIL tumbled over 5 per cent last week. The stock hovers above an immediate support level of ₹929 — the 21-week moving average. This support has been limiting the downside over the last four weeks. If RIL manages to sustain above this support and reverse higher, it can move up to test ₹1,000 levels again. Inability to break above ₹1,000 can continue to keep the stock range-bound between ₹929 and ₹1,000 for some more time. But a strong break above ₹1,000 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹1,030 or ₹1,035. The region between ₹1,030 and ₹1,035 is a crucial medium-term resistance for the stock. Whether RIL breaks above ₹1,035 or not will be key in deciding the next move. On the other hand, if RIL breaks below the immediate support level of ₹929, it can fall to ₹900 or ₹890 in the coming days. A crucial medium-term trend deciding support is poised around ₹890. A decisive weekly close below ₹890 may trigger a sharp corrective fall to ₹850. So the price action around ₹890 will need a close watch.










 Tata Steel (₹591.5)
Tata Steel surged, breaking above the key ₹615-₹620 resistance region last week, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made an intra-week high of ₹636.3 and reversed sharply lower, giving back all the gains made and closed 2.5 per cent lower for the week. Technically, the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance at ₹631 has halted the up-move and triggered the reversal. This indicates that the downtrend that has been in place since January is intact. Immediate resistance is inbetween ₹600 and ₹605. Inability to bounce from the current levels and breach this hurdle can continue to keep the stock under pressure. A fall to ₹570-₹565 is likely. If Tata Steel manages to bounce from ₹565 to ₹570, a relief rally to ₹600 is possible. But a break below ₹565 can drag the stock to ₹550. Traders with high risk appetite can go short on rallies at ₹598 and ₹605. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹615 for the target of ₹570. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹590 when it moves down to ₹580."

While RIL, HDFC Bank, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), HDFC, Maruti Suzuki India and Kotak Mahindra Bank saw gains in their market capitalisation (m-cap) for the week ended Friday, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), ITC, Infosys and SBI suffered losses. HDFC Bank’s m-cap jumped Rs 26,758.47 crore to Rs 5,49,179.08 crore.
The valuation of Maruti Suzuki soared Rs 7,410.02 crore to Rs 2,65,593.32 crore, and that of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) surged Rs 4,719.93 crore to Rs 5,88,692.15 crore.

Supports could limit the downside in SBI(₹277.5)
SBI rallied as expected last week to test the key resistance level of ₹285. The stock surged over 6 per cent during intra-week to mark a high of ₹289.3. But SBI fell from this high, giving back most of the gains and closed 1.8 per cent higher for the week. The near-term view is negative. The stock can test the immediate support at ₹273. A break below this support can pull the stock lower to ₹270. Further break below ₹270 will increase the likelihood of the stock declining to ₹265 or even ₹262 in the short term. On the other hand, if SBI manages to reverse higher from ₹273 or ₹270, the downside pressure would ease. In such a scenario, the stock can rally to revisit ₹285 levels. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹285 will confirm the end of the downtrend that has been in place since last November. It will then pave way for SBI to target ₹310 and ₹320 levels. Indicators on the charts signal that the downside could be limited in SBI.










Bearish outlook is intact in ITC (₹264.5)
ITC was down for the fifth consecutive week. The stock surged to a high of ₹274 in the initial part of the week, but failed to sustain higher. It reversed sharply lower from its high, giving back all the gains made during the week. The fall has dragged the stock decisively below the 200-day moving average, which has been providing strong support over the last couple of weeks. ITC looks vulnerable to break below the immediate support at ₹263.5 and may fall to ₹260 or ₹258 in the coming days. The price action on the chart keeps the bearish outlook intact. The fall over the last five weeks indicates that the broader ₹250-₹290 sideways range is intact. ITC has been stuck in this sideways range for a prolonged period of time since last August. A fall to test ₹250 is possible in the coming weeks. However, such a fall is a good buying opportunity for long-term investors as a break below ₹250 is unlikely. Investors can hold the long positions and accumulate on dips at ₹255 and ₹252. Retain the stop-loss at ₹220.










Key resistance is ahead for Infosys (₹1,280.4)
Infosys surged to record highs in the past week, as expected. The stock recorded a high of ₹1,290 and has come-off slightly to close 1.6 per cent higher for the week. A key resistance is in the ₹1,295-₹1,300 region, which is likely to be tested in the near term. But whether Infosys breaks above this hurdle or not will decide the next move. Inability to breach ₹1,300 can trigger a short-term corrective fall. A pull-back from ₹1,300 can drag the stock lower to ₹1,250 or ₹1,230 on the back of profit-booking. However, the downside in the stock is expected to be limited as fresh buying interest is likely to emerge at lower levels. Strong support is at around ₹1,200. The outlook will turn negative only if the stock breaks below this support. But this looks unlikely. As such, an eventual break above ₹1,300 will boost the momentum. This can take the stock up to ₹1,370. From a long-term perspective, Infosys is likely to target ₹1,450. Both medium and long-term investors can hold their long positions.










RIL hovers below a crucial resistance (₹1,013.8)
RIL surged over 3 per cent last week. The stock has been rallying consistently over the last three weeks and is up about 10 per cent. A key short-term resistance is at ₹1,023. If RIL manages to breach this hurdle, the current rally can extend to ₹1,040 or ₹1,045 in the near term. Further break above ₹1,045 will pave way for the next target of ₹1,100 and higher levels. But inability to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹1,023 will increase the likelihood of a corrective fall in the coming days. A pull-back from ₹1,023 will drag the stock lower to ₹990. Further break below ₹990 will drag RIL lower to ₹965 or even ₹950 in the short term. Such a fall will keep the ₹870-₹1,020 sideways range intact. But indicators on the charts are bullish. The 21-day moving average is turning around after just testing the 55-day moving average. This is a positive signal, indicating that the downside could be limited. As such the possibility is high of the stock breaking above ₹1,023 and rallying to ₹1,045.










Immediate outlook is mixed for Tata Steel(₹565.9)
Tata Steel tumbled 6 per cent in the past week. The stock has been volatile over the last few weeks, moving up one week and falling in the next. This leaves the near-term outlook mixed for the stock. The stock can remain range-bound between ₹550 and ₹610 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹550 or ₹610 will then determine the next trend. Traders can stay out of this stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges. A strong break above ₹610 can take Tata Steel higher to ₹635 or ₹650 in the short term. A break above ₹650 is required to mark the end of the corrective fall that has been in place since late January. The stock can then target ₹680 and ₹700 levels again. On the other hand, if Tata Steel breaks below ₹550 in the coming days, it can fall to ₹539 — a key 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement support level. A break below this support can drag it to ₹525. Such a fall will strengthen the downtrend and drag the stock to ₹500 or ₹470."

   -  THE HINDU




Leading paper and board manufacturers are worried as the Tamil Nadu government has decided to ban plastic-coated paper cups along with a wide range of plastic products as part of the nationwide campaign against disposable plastics.
As of now Tamil Nadu alone has included the LDPE-coated plastic cups. Paper and board manufacturers, downstream coating units and convertors are worried as this ban will affect them. 
There are over 20 coating units and over 500 cup manufacturers providing a total of over 15,000 jobs in the State directly. 
Possible impact
Also, large paper manufacturers including Tamil Nadu Newsprint, one of the biggest players in this grade of paper, could be impacted. Others such as West Coast Paper, Century Paper, ITC and JK Paper who also make the base paper could also be affected by the ban that kicks in from January 2019, according to industry sources. The Tamil Nadu Poly Coater Association has made a representation against the ban. The State government came out with the notification last month.
Association representatives pointed out that paper cups were brought as an environment friendly alternative to plastic cups. The plastic coating in paper cups accounts for about 5 per cent of the material, 95 per cent is paper. The LDPE coating is also food grade, degradable and is in use globally. The market size is estimated at about 12,000 tonnes of cups per month in Tamil Nadu, among the earliest to adapt this alternative, accounting for nearly half the usage.
Industry representatives pointed out that as of now, business establishments and hospitality industry will have to go back to traditional steel and glass tumblers."
52,2018-07-26,ITC,"Improved performance lights up ITC profit 
FMCG major ITC Ltd reported a near 10 per cent jump in net profit to ₹2,819 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. The net profit in the corresponding period in the last fiscal stood at ₹2,561 crore.
The profit was driven by improved performances across all its segments that include cigarettes, FMCG and hotels, and a reduced incidence of excise duties.
The gross revenue from sales for Q1 (April-June) FY19 stood at ₹10,722 crore. ITC in a statement to the bourses said revenues were not comparable considering the roll-out of GST which led to change in accounting procedures.
On a comparative basis, the gross sales (net of rebates and discounts) saw a 13.5 per cent jump year-on-year.
Major revenue earner
Cigarettes continued to be the major driver in revenues and profit before tax (PBT). It accounted for nearly 48 per cent of the company’s gross revenues at ₹5,128 crore from sale of products and 83 per cent of its PBT at ₹3,558 crore in Q1 FY19. 
The company said “punitive and discriminatory taxation and regulatory regime” was exerting severe pressure on the domestic legal cigarette industry. 
However, the company said it has consolidated its leadership position in the industry.
Some of the key interventions during the quarter include launch of variants such as Hollywood (triple segment filter) and Flake Taste Pro (dual segment filter). Additionally, two brands, American Club and Players, which were launched towards the end of 2016-17 will be scaled up, ITC said in a media statement 
Pressure on cigarette industry volumes, an adverse quality and leaf cost escalation pertaining to Andhra Pradesh’s 2017 crop, and lower export incentives weighed on the agri-business results that saw PBT dip by 17 per cent on a year-on-year basis.
Other segments
The FMCG’s other business – that include branded packaged food, staples, snacks, meals, dairy, beverages, confections, apparels, education and stationery, personal care, safe matches and incense sticks – saw an over 10 per cent jump in gross revenues for the period under review. According to media statement, most major categories enhanced their market standing.
The company added that capacity utilisation was scaled up in the integrated consumer goods manufacturing facilities at Kapurthala, Panchla and Guwahati.
Over 15 projects are underway and in various stages of development that include land acquisition, site development, construction of buildings, equipment installation and other infrastructure. 
Increased room rates in hotels and strategic investments in imported pulp substitution for the paperboards saw both the businesses report higher PBT numbers on an Y-o-Y basis."

50,2018-08-09,ITC,"Over 28 lakh counterfeit match boxes of ITC’s AIM brand seized


 Over 28 lakh counterfeit match boxes of AIM brand belonging to ITC Ltd were seized from various manufacturing units located in Kovilpatti and Sattur in Tamil Nadu. The raid and seizure was conducted on the orders of the Madras High Court in a suit filed by ITC. 
Multiple raids were conducted on ‘unscrupulous’ parties in both locations, manufacturing, selling and transporting counterfeits of AIM matches. 
In July 2018, ITC filed a suit before the Madras High Court against ten parties, both manufacturers and transporters, who were involved in the racket. The matches being manufactured by these parties were identical to ITC’s match boxes with minor variations such as ‘ATM’ or ‘AJM’ written in place of the original – AIM, a release from ITC said. 
Following orders of the Madras High Court, the court-appointed commissioners conducted raids at Sattur and Kovilpatti between July 19 and 21. Nearly 12 lakh match boxes were seized in these raids along with substantial quantity of illegal packaging material. The premises where these products were manufactured or stored were also sealed. 
On July 27, 2018, the Madras High Court took custody of these 12 lakh seized counterfeit matchboxes along with keys to sealed premises. An order restraining anyone from manufacturing, selling or transporting copies of ITC’s “AIM” match boxes was also passed. 
Subsequently, another raid was carried out on July 31, 2018 at Sattur in which another 16 lakh match boxes were seized. The premises was also sealed. 
“In its attempt to curb the larger and widespread menace of counterfeits, ITC will continue taking stringent action against all parties involved in the businesses of manufacturing, selling and transporting fake ITC brand of matches, including AIM,” the release said."

SBI (₹308.8)








 
SBI inched higher in the initial part of the week and then remained range-bound for the rest of the week. The stock closed 2.8 per cent higher for the week. Though the daily candle chart gives a mixed outlook, the weekly chart is bullish. A key near-term resistance is at ₹312. Inability to breach this hurdle and a subsequent fall below ₹303 — the 21-day moving average support — can drag the stock lower to ₹290 in the short term. But the downside is likely to be limited as a break below the ₹290-285 support cluster is unlikely. On the other hand, if SBI manages to break above ₹312, an up-move to ₹320 can be seen. The level of ₹320 is a key short-term resistance. A strong break and a decisive close above this hurdle will boost the momentum. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹350 or even ₹370 over the medium term. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions. Retain the stop-loss at ₹283. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹318.
 
ITC (₹319.1)








 
The uptrend in ITC remains intact and is gaining momentum. The stock surged 2.8 per cent last week and closed at a key resistance level of ₹319. A pull-back in the initial part of the week can take the stock lower to ₹315 or ₹312. But further fall below ₹312 looks unlikely at the moment. The levels of ₹312 and ₹307 are significant supports for ITC, which are likely to limit the downside in the short term. A bounce back from either ₹315 or ₹312 will increase the likelihood of the stock breaking above ₹319 decisively. Such a break can take ITC higher to ₹327 — the next crucial resistance level. As mentioned last week, a strong break above ₹327 will give the stock fresh momentum. In such a scenario, ITC will gear up for a fresh rally to ₹360 over the medium term. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Short-term traders who have taken long positions at ₹297 can hold with a stop-loss at ₹303. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹308 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹321. Book profits at ₹330.
 
 
Infosys (₹1,440)








 
Infosys surged over 4 per cent last week. The 21-day moving average is continuing to provide strong support. This support has been limiting the downside in the stock consistently since April. Immediate resistance is in the ₹1,447-1,450 region. Inability to breach ₹1,450 can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹1,400 or ₹1,390. But a strong break above ₹1,450 can take Infosys higher to ₹1,490 or ₹1,500. The region between ₹1,490 and ₹1,500 is a key resistance. A corrective fall after testing this resistance region cannot be ruled out. Long-term investors can book partial profits at ₹1,480 and keep the stop-loss for the rest of the holdings at ₹1,360. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions, retain the stop-loss at ₹1,360 and book profits at $1,485. The uptrend in Infosys will come under threat only if it declines below the 21-day moving average (₹1,393) support decisively. Such a break will trigger a fall to ₹1,350 . Further break below ₹1,350 can then drag the stock to ₹1,320 or even lower thereafter.
 
 
RIL (₹1,240.9)








 
RIL began the week on a positive note and surged about 4 per cent intra-week to record a high of ₹1,328. However, the stock lost momentum and reversed sharply lower, giving back all the gains made and closed 3 per cent lower for the week. The near-term outlook is negative. Resistance is around ₹1,280. As long as the stock remains below ₹1,280, the possibility of the stock breaking below ₹1,229 — the 21-day moving average — is high. Such a break can take RIL lower to ₹1,210 initially. A strong break below ₹1,210 will turn the outlook to negative. In such a scenario, a sharp fall to ₹1,160 or even lower levels is possible on the back of profit-booking. On the other hand, if RIL manages to reverse higher from the immediate support levels of ₹1,229 or ₹1,210, the downside pressure may ease. A bounce-back move to ₹1,260 or ₹1,270 is possible in that case. A decisive break and close above ₹1,270 will bring back the bullish momentum. It will then increase the possibility of the stock revisiting ₹1,300 and ₹1,320.
 
 
Tata Steel (₹601.6)








 
Tata Steel surged 4.6 per cent last week, recovering all the loss made in the earlier week. With this up-move, the stock has regained its strength. Support is in the ₹593-₹590 region, which is likely to limit the downside in the near term. A break below ₹590 can drag the stock lower to ₹570 or ₹565. But such a fall looks less probable as the indicators on the chart are positive . The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 100-day moving average. This is a bullish signal. Immediate resistance is at ₹619 . The possibilityof the stock breaking above this hurdle is high. Such a break can will see the current uptrend extending to ₹625 and ₹635 levels in the coming days. The region between ₹635 and ₹640 is a crucial resistance. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹640 will confirm that the downtrend that has been in place since January has reversed. As such, the price action around the ₹635-₹640 resistance region will need a close watch to get a cue on the direction of the next move."

 SBI (₹270) 
SBI plummeted 7 per cent last week breaking below the key support levels of ₹275 and ₹270. The stock made an intra-week low of ₹253.6 and recovered some of the loss before closing the week at ₹270. Near-term resistances are at ₹275 and ₹278. As long as the stock trades below ₹278, the outlook will remain negative and a fall to ₹256 is possible. A bounce from ₹256 can take the stock higher to ₹270 levels again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹256 and ₹278 is possible. But if SBI breaks below ₹256 decisively, it will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹245 or ₹243 in the coming weeks. Traders can go short if SBI reverses lower from the ₹275-278 resistance region. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹291 for the target of ₹245. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹270 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹260. The outlook for the stock will turn positive only on a strong rise past ₹278. In such a scenario, a relief rally to ₹287 and ₹290 is possible.










 ITC (₹303.7) 
ITC managed to stay afloat amid a strong sell-off in the broader markets last week. The stock made a smart recovery after falling about 3 per cent intra-week and closed just 1 per cent lower for the week. This reflects the inherent strength in the stock. It will come under pressure only if it declines below ₹295. The next targets are ₹290 and ₹285. But as long as ITC sustains above ₹295, the broader uptrend will remain intact. Immediate resistances are at ₹307 and ₹309. A strong break above ₹309 will take ITC higher to ₹317 or ₹321 over the short term. Further break above ₹321 will then target ₹327 — the next crucial resistance level. As being reiterated over the last few weeks, a decisive break above ₹327 will boost the momentum and trigger a fresh rally to ₹360 over the medium term. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Traders with a medium-term perspective can make use of dips to go long at ₹298 and ₹293. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹270 for the target of ₹355.










Infosys (₹706.3)
Infosys tumbled 4 per cent last week. The sharp fall over the past week has taken the stock decisively below the 21-day moving average support that has been limiting the downside over the last five months. It also indicates early signs of the uptrend, that has been in place since September 2017, getting reversed. The region between ₹718 and ₹720 is a key resistance, which has to be breached to ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take Infosys higher to ₹740 and ₹750 levels again. But as long as the stock remains below ₹721, there is a strong likelihood of it breaking below the crucial support level of ₹690 in the coming days. Such a break will confirm the trend reversal and drag Infosys to ₹660. Further break below ₹660 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹630 and ₹625. Short-term traders with high-risk appetite can go short on a bounce to ₹710 and ₹717. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹732 for the target of ₹670. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹695 when it moves to ₹685.










 RIL (₹1,216.8) 
 RIL fell, breaking below the key support level of ₹1,225 and closed about 3 per cent lower for the week. A complex head-and-shoulder reversal pattern is visible on the chart. This is a bearish pattern indicating a reversal of the current uptrend .The neckline resistance of this pattern is poised around ₹1,237. Also, another key resistance is at ₹1,253. The outlook will turn positive only if RIL manages to breach ₹1,253. This will see the stock revisiting ₹1,300 and ₹1,320 levels. But as long as the stock trades below ₹1,253, a fall to ₹1,175 or ₹1,170 cannot be ruled out in the short term. A bounce from the ₹1,175-1,170 support zone can trigger a relief rally to ₹1,200 and ₹1,220. But a break below ₹1,170 will increase the likelihood of the stock falling to ₹1,100. Traders with a medium-term perspective can wait for a bounce and go short at ₹1,225 and ₹1,245. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,265 for the target of ₹1,120. Revise the stop-loss to ₹1,205 when the stock moves down to ₹1,190.










 Tata Steel (₹615.3) 
Tata Steel seems to have remained insulated from the broader market sell-off. Though the stock tumbled about 6 per cent intraday on Friday, it managed to recover all the loss and close the week 1.5 per cent higher. Key resistance is at ₹640. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹680 and ₹700 thereafter. But if the sell-off in the broader market intensifies, the upside in this stock could be capped at ₹640. In such a scenario, Tata Steel can remain range-bound between ₹575 and ₹640 for some time. The outlook will turn negative only if Tata Steel declines below ₹575 — the 21-week moving average. Such a break can drag it to ₹550. But the price action on the chart indicates that the stock is likely to sustain above ₹575. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹560. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹620 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹635. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹635 as soon as Tata Steel moves up to ₹655."

SBI (₹265)
SBI was range-bound between ₹261 and ₹274 and closed 1.8 per cent lower for the week. The bias remains negative and any intermediate bounce in the coming days could be short-lived. A strong break below ₹261 — the 200-week moving average — can take the stock lower to ₹255. If SBI manages to bounce from ₹255, a relief rally to ₹270 is possible. But a strong break below ₹255 will increase the downside pressure. Such a break will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling to ₹245 thereafter. On the other hand, if SBI sustains above ₹261, a bounce to ₹275 is possible. The region between ₹275 and ₹277 is a key resistance zone. A strong break above ₹277 is needed to ease the downside pressure. This break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹285 over the short term. Traders with a high-risk appetite can go short on rallies at ₹273 and ₹276. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹291 for a target of ₹245. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹267 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹259.










ITC (₹296.7)
ITC shares fell 2.3 per cent and were down for the fourth consecutive week. Clusters of moving average and trendline supports are poised in the ₹290-₹280 region, which is holding well for now. ITC made a low of ₹289.5 last week and bounced from there. If the stock sustains above ₹290, an up-move to ₹305 and ₹307 is possible. A strong break above ₹307 will take the stock up to ₹317 or even ₹321 over the short term. It will confirm the end of the corrective fall that has been in place since early September. But if ITC reverses lower from the ₹305-307 resistance region, it can fall back to ₹295 and ₹290 levels again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹290 and ₹307 is possible for some time. A break below ₹290 can take ITC lower to ₹285 and ₹280. Investors can hold their long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Medium-term traders who took long positions last week on dips at ₹298 and ₹293 can hold them. Retain the stop-loss at ₹270 for a target of ₹355.










Infosys (₹727.8)
Infosys surged 3 per cent last week, recovering most of the loss made in the week earlier. The sharp bounce in the past week has triggered the stop-loss on the short positions recommended last week. The price action over the past two weeks leaves the immediate outlook unclear for the stock. Key support is at ₹690 and resistance is in between ₹740 and ₹750. Infosys can remain in a broad sideways range between ₹690 and ₹750. A breakout on either side of ₹690 or ₹750 will then decide the next move. A strong break above ₹750 can take the stock higher to ₹757 initially. A break above ₹757 will then take the stock fhigher to ₹770 thereafter. On the other hand, if the Infosys stock breaks below ₹690, it can come under selling pressure. This break will drag the stock lower to ₹660 on the back of profit-booking. It will also confirm that the uptrend since August 2017 has reversed. Further break below ₹660 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹630 and ₹625










RIL (₹1,258.2)
Contrary to expectations, RIL surged over 3 per cent last week. The short positions recommended last week have been stopped out on the strong bounce-back move witnessed last week. The head and shoulder reversal pattern mentioned last week has got negated. A key support is at ₹1,242. As long as the stock remains above this support, an up-move to ₹1,280 is possible. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,280 will boost the momentum. Such a break will then pave way for a fresh rally to ₹1,350 or even higher levels. The bullish outlook will get negated if RIL declines below ₹1,242 decisively. Such a break can drag the stock lower to ₹1,200 or ₹1,195 in the near term. Further break below ₹1,195 will then increase the likelihood of the downmove extending to ₹1,185 or ₹1,180. The level of ₹1,180 is a crucial long-term trend-line support for the stock. The uptrend that has been in place since the beginning of this year will come under threat if RIL declines below ₹1,180.










Tata Steel (₹580.35)
Tata Steel tumbled over 7 per cent last week. The stock is poised above a crucial support level of ₹575. Whether Tata Steel bounces from this support or not will determine the next move. A bounce from ₹575 will ease the downside pressure. In such a scenario, an up-move to ₹605 or ₹615 can be seen in the near term. An inability to breach ₹615 levels can drag the stock to ₹590. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹575 and ₹615 can be seen. But if Tata Steel manages to breach ₹615, it can extend its rally to ₹637 and ₹640 thereafter. On the other hand, if Tata Steel breaks below ₹575, it can fall to ₹559. Further break below ₹559 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹540 or ₹535 thereafter. Medium-term traders can retain their long positions. Keep the stop-loss at ₹560. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹605 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹613. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹615 as soon as Tata Steel goes up to ₹630."

SBI (₹285.4)
SBI skyrocketed 15 per cent last week. The stock tested the ₹290-292 resistance region on Friday and has come-off slightly after making a high of ₹292.65. As long as it trades below ₹292, an intermediate dip to ₹280 or ₹276 cannot be ruled out. Key supports are at ₹279 and ₹276. A strong break below ₹276 can drag SBI initially to ₹268. A further break below ₹268 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹260 or ₹257 over the short term. On the other hand, if SBI manages to bounce from ₹276, the outlook will remain bullish. In such a scenario, the possibility of the stock breaching above ₹292 will be high. A strong break above ₹292 will trigger a fresh rally to ₹311. A further break above ₹311 can then take SBI to the next target of ₹322. Short-term traders with a high-risk appetite can go long on dips at ₹282 and accumulate at ₹279. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹271 for the target of ₹305. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹285 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹292.










ITC (₹282.3)
ITC fell in the initial part of last week, but managed to bounce from the low of ₹273.15. The price action on the chart indicates that the stock is getting fresh buying interest below the support level of ₹275. This keeps the bias positive. An up-move to ₹287 and ₹292 is likely in the near term. Inability to breach ₹292 can drag it to ₹280 and ₹275 again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹275 and ₹292 can be seen for some time. But a strong break above ₹292 can take ITC higher to ₹298 and ₹300. A further break above ₹300 will then pave way for the next target of ₹307. The bullish outlook will get negated only if ITC makes a decisive close below ₹275. Such a break will increase the possibility of the stock falling to ₹270 or even ₹265 in the coming days. Traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹283 and ₹280. Retain the stop-loss at ₹273 for the target of ₹298. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹285 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹289.










Infosys (₹662)
Infosys surged over 9 per cent intra week, but failed to sustain higher. The pull-back from ₹693.9 indicates that the stock is getting fresh sellers at higher levels. Near-term resistance is in the ₹680-682 region. As long as the stock trades below this resistance zone, a fall to test the key support level of ₹630 is possible again. If Infosys manages to bounce from ₹630, it can remain range-bound between ₹630 and ₹700. However, the outlook will continue to be negative as long as the stock remains below ₹700. An eventual break below ₹630 can drag Infosys lower to ₹600 and ₹590. Traders can hold the short positions taken at ₹670 and ₹675. Retain the stop-loss at ₹710 for the target of ₹600. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹665 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹655. The outlook will turn positive only if the stock manages to rise past the psychological level of ₹700. The next targets are ₹720 and ₹730. However, such a strong up-move looks less probable at the moment.










RIL (₹1,074.2)
RIL traded in a narrow range between ₹1,047 and ₹1,093 last week. The near-term outlook is unclear. Immediate resistance is in the ₹1,088-1,090 region. If RIL manages to breach ₹1,090 decisively, an up-move to ₹1,130 or ₹1,135 is possible. A strong break above ₹1,035 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its rally to ₹1,185 or even ₹1,200. But a pull-back from ₹1,135 can drag the stock lower to ₹1,080 and ₹1,050 and keep it range-bound between ₹1,030 and ₹1,135 . On the other hand, if RIL fails to breach ₹1,090, it can break below the near-term support level of ₹1,050 and fall initially to ₹1,030. A further break below ₹1,030 will increase the selling pressure and drag RIL to ₹1,010 and ₹990 thereafter. Traders who have taken short positions at ₹1,075 and ₹1,085 on rallies last week should remain cautious. Stop-loss can be lowered to ₹1,105. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹1,060 as soon as RIL declines to ₹1,045. Book profits at ₹1,015.










Tata Steel (₹573.7)
Tata Steel tumbled about 4 per cent intraweek to make a low of ₹530. However, it managed to reverse higher sharply, recovering all the loss, and closed over 4 per cent higher for the week. A key resistance is at ₹583. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹595 and ₹600. It will also confirm an inverted head and shoulder pattern on the chart. A pull-back from the ₹595-600 region can find support in the broad ₹580-₹570 region. An eventual break above ₹600 can then target ₹615 and ₹625. On the other hand, if the stock reverses lower from ₹583, it can fall to ₹570 or ₹565. A further break below ₹565 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹550 and ₹540. Traders holding short positions at an average price of ₹561 should remain cautious and revise the stop-loss lower to ₹585. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹557 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹552. Book profits at ₹540."

42,2018-12-12,ITC,"ITC's Technico signs pact with Scottish institute for new potato varieties

FILE PHOTO


Technico Agri Sciences, an agri-biotech company owned by diversified Indian conglomerate- ITC, has tied up with Scotland-based James Hutton Institute to bring in 16 varieties and 600 clones of potato to India.
These differentiated varieties, expected to improve yields by 15 to 20 per cent, will undergo trials and evaluation to identify varieties suitable for cultivation in different States the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
The varieties are expected to benefit Indian potato farmers, particularly in the States of UP, MP, Gujarat, Punjab, West Bengal and Bihar, potato processing industry as well as potato exports from the country. The agreement signed in a function at Chandigarh would be for five years, it said.
“Technico has been engaging extensively with farmers and processors across different geographies to help improve farm yield in potatoes significantly. The improvement in yields along with better prices for such varieties has contributed to the doubling of farmers’ income and has also facilitated exports and processing,” Sachid Madan, Chief Executive of Technico Agri Sciences was quoted in the release."

SBI (₹289.1)
SBI opened the week on a negative note with a wide gap-down of ₹14 at ₹261.1. The stop-loss on the long positions recommended was hit. However, the stock managed to claw-back from the low of ₹261.1, recovering all the loss and closed on a positive note. The stock was up 5 per cent for the week. A crucial near-term resistance is at ₹294. Whether SBI breaks above this hurdle or not will determine the direction of the next move. Inability to breach ₹294 can pull the stock lower to ₹278 or ₹274 in the near term. A further break below ₹274 will then target ₹269. On the other hand, if SBI breaks above ₹294 decisively, it can gain strength. Such a break can take the stock initially higher to ₹310 and ₹312. A strong break above ₹312 will then pave way for the next target of ₹322 thereafter. Short-term traders can go long on a break above ₹294. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹282 for the target of ₹318. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹307.










ITC (₹275.6)
ITC broke below the key support level of ₹271 in the initial part of the week. However, negative sentiment was short-lived as ITC reversed sharply higher, recovering all the loss from the low of ₹268.2. Though the daily candles on the chart give mixed signals, the weekly candles are relatively positive. Support is in the ₹272-271 region. As long as the stock remains above this support zone, there is a strong likelihood of it breaking above the near-term resistance level of ₹279. Such a break can take ITC initially higher to ₹285 or ₹287. A further break above ₹287 will increase the possibility of the stock extending its up-move towards the 21-week moving average resistance level of ₹293. The bullish outlook will get negated if ITC breaks and closes decisively below ₹271. The stock can, thus, fall initially to ₹267. A bounce from ₹267 can take the stock higher to ₹271 and ₹272 again. But a strong break below ₹267 will increase the downside pressure. This will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹262 thereafter.










Infosys (₹705.6)
Infosys is retaining its strength. The stock was up for the third consecutive week. It surged 3.6 per cent, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹687 and closed on a strong note. The outlook is bullish. Immediate support is at ₹698 and the next key support is at ₹688. Also, there is an inverted head and shoulder pattern visible on the daily chart. This is a bullish reversal pattern. The neckline support of this pattern is at ₹684. Intermediate dips in the near term are likely to find fresh buyers coming into the market. An up-move to ₹721 is likely in the near term. Inability to breach ₹721 can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹700. But an eventual break above ₹721 will boost the momentum. This will increase the likelihood of the stock revisiting ₹740 and ₹750 levels. Traders can go long at current levels and also accumulate on dips at the levels of ₹701 and ₹693. Keep the stop-loss at ₹675 for the target of ₹760. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹715 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹730.










RIL (₹1,111.7)
RIL fell for the second consecutive week. The stock was down about 2 per cent last week. However, the sharp bounce from the week’s low of ₹1,055 gives a breather for the stock. The 200-day as well as a trend-line, both poised around ₹1,055, has provided strong support for RIL. The near-term outlook is mixed. Resistance is at ₹1,128. If RIL manages to sustain above ₹1,100 and decisively break above ₹1,128, the near-term outlook will turn positive. An up-move to ₹1,160 is possible. A further break above ₹1,160 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹1,185. On the other hand, if RIL declines below ₹1,100, it can fall to ₹1,055 again. A further break below ₹1,055 will increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹1,030 or even ₹1,010 thereafter. Broadly, RIL has been range-bound between ₹1,050 and ₹1,200 since October. A decisive breakout on either side of ₹1,050 or ₹1,200 will determine the direction of the next move. Traders can stay out of this stock until a clear trend emerges.










Tata Steel (₹513.4)
Tata Steel snapped its three-week fall. The stock reversed higher from the low of ₹486.9, recovering all the loss and closed 1.1 per cent higher for the week. Though the stock has bounced back, the price action seems to be lacking strength. This leaves the bias negative and keeps the broader downtrend intact. Cluster of resistance is poised in the ₹530-540 region, which can cap the upside in the near term. If Tata Steel manages to breach ₹540, an upmove to ₹565 and ₹570 is possible. But while below ₹540, a fall again to ₹485 and ₹480 cannot be ruled out. A bounce from around ₹480 again can keep the stock range-bound between ₹480 and ₹540. But a strong break below ₹480 can drag Tata Steel lower to ₹460. The level of ₹460 is a crucial long-term trend support, which may have the potential to halt the downtrend that has been in place since the beginning of this year. As such, the price action around ₹460 will need a close watch to get a cue on the next move."
40,2018-12-21,ITC,"ITC enters crowded branded rice market with Sona Masoori 
FMCG major ITC Ltd has made a quiet entry into the packaged rice segment, mainly the non-basmati variety. Market sources say the company is piloting with the ‘sona masoori’ variety in Bengaluru.
‘Sona masoori’ is one of the fine variety of non-basmati rice and is largely grown in the Tungabhadra belt of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. It is largely consumed in South India, mainly in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
Under the present pilot, that began a couple of weeks ago, ITC is selling in 25-kg packs offering ‘free home delivery’ at an special offer price of ₹1,400 per bag.
Hemant Malik, Divisional Chief Executive, Foods Business, ITC Ltd, said “Leveraging the company’s agri-sourcing expertise, we have initiated a pilot in Bengaluru to sell Sona Masoori rice under the Aashirvaad brand. The approach in the initial phase of this pilot is like that of a start-up and the focus is on enabling consumer feedback and insights.”
The entry of large players like ITC, which have a wide distribution network, into marketing of staples will result in increased competition, say traders and rice millers. There are hundreds of non-basmati rice brands which are sold in 5-, 10- and 25-kg packs.
Already, Patanjali and Adani Wilmar (Fortune brand) have launched sona masoori variants in select markets. Other major branded packaged rice companies include the likes of KRBL (that owns India Gate brand), LT Foods (Dawaat), Kohinoor, Patanjali and so on. However, most of these are basmati rice offerings
The ‘Aashirvaad’ brand was set up in 2002 to sell atta and later expanded into other categories such as spices, salt, ghee, milk, and instant mix offerings. The brand has a consumer spend of over ₹4,000 crore.
It is not known by when ITC plans a formal foray or a pan-India presence into the packaged rice segment. Nor is it still clear if the company will look at regional variants.
Market sources said, ITC already exports both basmati and non-basmati rice to some African and West Asian markets. And naturally then it has its own procurement and logistics network."

SBI (₹294.4) 
SBI is managing to sustain higher. The stock dipped to an intraweek low of ₹287.2, but reversed immediately higher from there. The resistance at ₹301 is likely to be tested in the near term. Inability to breach ₹301 can pull SBI lower to ₹290 and ₹287 again. But the price action on the chart leaves the bias bullish for the stock to break above ₹301 and rally towards ₹310 and ₹312. A further break above ₹312 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹320 and ₹322. The region around ₹322 is a crucial long-term resistance. The price action around this hurdle will need a close watch to get a cue on the next direction of move. Supports are at ₹287 and ₹284.5. The near-term view will turn negative only if SBI declines below ₹284.5. The next target is ₹280. But such a fall looks less probable at the moment. Traders who have taken long positions above ₹294 can hold with a stop-loss at ₹282. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock goes up to ₹307. Book profits at ₹318. 










ITC (₹281.9) 
ITC inched higher for the third consecutive week. The stock was up 2 per cent last week. Immediate resistance is at ₹284 and support at ₹278. The stock is likely to breach ₹284 and test ₹287 in the near term. A break above ₹287 can then target ₹290. The levels of ₹287 and ₹290 are key resistances, and whether ITC breaches these hurdles or not will decide the direction of the next move. A decisive break above ₹290 will boost the momentum and take ITC higher to ₹296 and ₹300 thereafter. Such an up-move will also confirm the end of the downtrend that has been in place since September. On the other hand, if ITC reverses lower from ₹287 or ₹290, it can fall to ₹280 and ₹275 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹275 and ₹290.










Infosys (₹657.6) 
Infosys fell in the initial part of the week but managed to claw-back from the low of ₹637.7 and closed 2 per cent higher. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 200-day moving average support at ₹649 is holding well . Key resistances are at ₹663, ₹666 and ₹671. As long as Infosys trades above ₹649, a test of the above-mentioned hurdles is possible in the near term. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹671 will turn the outlook to positive and take the stock higher to ₹682 and ₹686. A further break above ₹686 will then pave way for the next short-term targets of ₹700 and ₹710. The stock will come under pressure if it breaks decisively below the 200-day moving average. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹630. A break below ₹630 can then drag it to ₹600 and ₹590. Traders who took short positions last week at ₹660 should remain cautious. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹675. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹655 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹645. Book profits at ₹630. 










RIL (₹1,125.8) 
RIL reversed sharply higher last week after making a low of ₹1,066.5 and closed 2 per cent higher. The upward reversal has happened from the 200-day moving average, which has been providing strong support for the stock since October. The near-term view is positive and RIL can move up to ₹1,180 and ₹1,185. The stock has been range-bound between ₹1,050 and ₹1,185 for more than three months now. Its ability to bounce higher every time it dips to the 200-day moving average keeps the bias positive . The possibility is also high of the stock breaking above ₹1,185. Such a break will take RIL initially higher to ₹1,205 or ₹1,210. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,210 will then boost the momentum and pave way for the next target of ₹1,275. Medium-term investors can go long at current levels and accumulate on dips at ₹1,095 and ₹1,070. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,025. The outlook will turn negative only if RIL closes decisively below the 200-day moving average support. In such a scenario, the stock can fall to ₹1,000 and ₹990.










Tata Steel (₹513.7) 
After inching higher for two weeks, Tata Steel reversed last week. Trading in the stock was subdued. It was stuck in a narrow range between ₹505 and ₹521 last week. The 21-day moving average at ₹519 is restricting the upside. A strong break and a decisive close above this hurdle is needed to ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹533 or even ₹539 over the short term. Inability to breach ₹533 or ₹539 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹520 and ₹518. But a strong break above ₹539 will boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹546 and ₹550. On the other hand, if Tata Steel remains below the 21-day moving average resistance, a fall to ₹505 or ₹500 is possible in the near term. A break below ₹500 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹480. A bounce from ₹480 can keep the stock range-bound between ₹480 and ₹530 for some time. But a decisive break below ₹480 can then drag Tata Steel lower to the crucial support level of ₹460."

SBI (297.5) 
SBI has been struggling over the last few weeks for strong follow-through buyers to take it decisively above ₹300. But, at the same time, the stock is also not attracting fresh sellers to drag it sharply lower. This leaves the bias bullish. The 21-day moving average at ₹289 is a key near-term support. As long as SBI trades above this support, the possibility of the stock breaching the ₹300-₹302 support zone is high. Such a break will take the stock higher initially to ₹310 and ₹312. A further break above ₹312 can then target ₹320 and ₹322. As mentioned last week, a crucial long-term resistance is poised around ₹322. As such, the price action around it will need a close watch to get a cue on the direction of the next move. The near-term view will turn negative if SBI declines decisively below ₹289. In such a scenario, a fall to ₹282 or ₹280 is possible. Traders who have taken long positions above ₹294 can hold it with a stop-loss at ₹282. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹307. Book profits at ₹318.










ITC (₹280.7) 
ITC was stuck in a sideways range between ₹277 and ₹284 last week. The resistance at ₹284 is continuing to cap the upside for the third consecutive week. A strong break above this hurdle is needed to ease the downside pressure for the stock. Such a break can take ITC higher initially to ₹287 and ₹290 — the next key resistance levels. If ITC manages to breach ₹290 decisively, the stock can gain momentum and target ₹296 and ₹300. But a pull-back from ₹290 can drag the stock lower to ₹285 and ₹280 again. On the other hand, if ITC continues to trade below ₹284 in the coming days and declines below ₹277, it can test ₹275 and ₹274. The outlook will turn completely negative if the stock breaks decisively below ₹274. In such a scenario, there is a strong likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹270 and ₹268. But the price action on the chart makes the bias bullish for ITC to break above ₹284. Medium-term investors who have taken long positions at ₹282 and ₹278 can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹262.










Infosys (₹660.7) 
Infosys seems to be lacking strength. The stock inched up in the initial part of the week but failed to sustain higher. Infosys made an intraweek high of ₹677 and came-off sharply giving up almost all the gains made during the week. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 200-day moving average at ₹650 is a crucial support to watch out for. If Infosys manages to sustain above this support, a bounce to ₹675 and ₹680 is possible in the near term. A strong break above ₹680 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹700 and ₹710 levels thereafter. The region around ₹710 is a significant resistance. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹710 is needed to turn the outlook completely to positive. Such a break will then pave way for the next targets of ₹750 and ₹760. On the other hand, if Infosys declines decisively below the 200-day moving average, it can come under renewed pressure. In such a scenario, a fall initially to ₹630 can be seen. A further break below ₹630 can then drag the stock lower to ₹600 and ₹590. 










RIL (₹1,099)
RIL has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹1,050 and ₹1,150 over the last one month. Within this range, the stock fell 2 per cent in the past week. A breakout on either side of ₹1,050 or ₹1,150 will determine the direction of the next move. The 200-day moving average support is at ₹1,069. A decisive close below this support will increase the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,050. A break below ₹1,050 will take RIL initially lower to ₹1,020. A further break below ₹1,020 will then increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹900 or even ₹980 thereafter. On the other hand, if RIL sustains above the 200-day moving average support, the bias will remain positive. A strong break above ₹1,150 will ease the downside pressure. The next targets are ₹1,190 and ₹1,200. A strong break above ₹1,200 will turn the outlook to positive and will pave way for a revisit of ₹1,250 and ₹1,300. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions taken at ₹1,125 and ₹1,095. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,025. 










Tata Steel (₹487.7) 
Tata Steel tumbled 5 per cent last week. The sharp fall last week indicates that the long-term downtrend in the stock is intact. Though there is a support near current levels at ₹480, Tata Steel looks vulnerable to break below it. A break below ₹480 can take the stock lower to ₹460. A further break below ₹460 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹430. Cluster of significant supports are poised in the broad ₹460-₹430 region. There is a strong likelihood of the current downtrend halting in this support zone. A strong upward reversal from this ₹460-₹430 support zone could be a good buying opportunity for investors with a long-term perspective. As such, the price action around the ₹460-₹430 support zone will need a close watch to get a cue on the next trend. On the other hand, if Tata Steel sustains above ₹480, a bounce to ₹500 or ₹510 can be seen. But the upside is likely to be capped as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels."

36,2019-02-17,ITC,"Nine of top-10 most valued firms lose Rs 98,863 cr in m-cap 
 Nine of the top-10 most-valued companies suffered a combined erosion of Rs 98,862.63 crore in market valuation last week, with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and SBI taking the steepest hit.
ITC was the only gainer from the top-10 list. RIL, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDFC Bank, HUL, Infosys, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI Bank suffered losses for the week ended Friday, according to a weekly analysis of their market capitalisation (m-cap) trend on the BSE.
Over the last week, the Sensex dropped 737.53 points, or over 2 per cent, to close at 35,808.95 on Friday.
From the most-valued companies’ list, RIL’s valuation slumped Rs 21,456.38 crore to Rs 7,88,213.12 crore, the biggest hit among the top-10 firms.
The market cap of SBI plunged Rs 19,723.34 crore to Rs 2,34,672.03 crore, and that of TCS plummeted Rs 11,951.35 crore to Rs 7,62,071.81 crore.
HDFC’s valuation tumbled Rs 11,725.23 crore to Rs 3,22,531.39 crore and that of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) tanked Rs 9,600.22 crore to Rs 3,83,803.08 crore.
The m-cap of ICICI Bank dived Rs 8,293.27 crore to Rs 2,20,351.47 crore and that of Infosys dropped Rs 7,906.92 crore to Rs 3,24,044.79 crore.
HDFC Bank’s valuation declined Rs 5,998.66 crore to Rs 5,71,599.92 crore and that of Kotak Mahindra Bank dipped Rs 2,207.26 crore to Rs 2,44,943.86 crore. In contrast, ITC added Rs 4,593.55 crore to Rs 3,42,495.09 crore.
In the ranking of top-10 firms, RIL was at number one position, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, HUL, ITC, Infosys, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, SBI and ICICI Bank."
35,2019-03-03,ITC,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (272.9) 
SBI began the week on a weak note and fell about 2 per cent initially. However, the stock managed to reverse sharply higher from the low of ₹266.3, recovering all the loss. The price action on the charts over the last couple of weeks leaves the near-term outlook positive. A key support is at ₹267, which is likely to limit the downside. An upmove to ₹280 and ₹285 is likely in the near term. A cluster of resistances is poised in the ₹280-285 zone. Inability to breach this resistance region can drag SBI to ₹270 again. But a strong break above ₹285 will boost the momentum and increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹295 and ₹300 in the coming weeks. Short-term traders with a high-risk appetite can go long at current levels and accumulate at ₹269. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹265 for the target of ₹285. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹276 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹279. The 200-week moving average at ₹260 is a crucial support. The outlook will turn negative only if SBI declines below this support.










ITC (₹277.8) 
ITC has been stuck in the ₹273-284 sideways range for more than a month now. Within this range, the near-term outlook is bullish. ITC has risen and closed above the 21-day moving average at ₹276.5, which will now act as a good support. As long as the stock trades above this support, an upmove to ₹284 is possible in the near term. A pull-back from ₹284 levels will keep the sideways range intact and take the stock lower to ₹277-275 again. But a decisive close above ₹284 will mark the end of the sideways consolidation. It will then take the stock initially to ₹289. A further break above ₹289 will then trigger a fresh rally, targeting ₹301. The bullish outlook will get negated only if ITC breaks below 273. The next target is ₹265. But the price action on the chart keeps the bias positive and leaves the possibility high of the stock breaching ₹284 in the coming days. As such, investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at ₹282, ₹278 and ₹272. Retain the stop-loss at ₹262.










Infosys (₹741.1) 
Infosys surged to a high of ₹757.8, but later gave back most of the gains. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 21-day moving average resistance is at ₹747. A decisive close above it is needed to turn the outlook to positive. Such a break can take Infosys higher to ₹790 and ₹800. But as long as the stock trades below ₹747, a dip to ₹725 cannot be ruled out in the near term. A break below ₹725 will then take the stock lower to ₹710 or even ₹700 thereafter. However, a further fall below ₹700 looks unlikely. A cluster of supports poised between ₹710 and ₹700 is likely to limit the downside. An upward reversal from the ₹710-700 support zone will trigger a fresh rally to ₹745 and ₹750. A further break above ₹750 will then give rise to targets of ₹770 and ₹790. Medium-term traders can make use of dips to go long at ₹725. Accumulate longs at ₹720 and ₹715. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹680 for a target of ₹790. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹735 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹755. 










RIL (₹1,226.7) 
RIL inched lower for the third consecutive week. The 21-day moving average resistance at ₹1,248 continued to cap the upside in the stock for the second consecutive week. RIL can remain range-bound between ₹1,200 and ₹1,250 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹1,200 or ₹1,250 will decide the direction of the next move. A strong break above ₹1,250 can take the stock initially to ₹1,260. A further decisive break above ₹1,260 will boost the momentum and increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹1,300 and ₹1,320 in the short term. On the other hand, if RIL declines decisively below ₹1,200, the stock will come under renewed pressure. In such a scenario, RIL can fall initially to ₹1,175. A further break below ₹1,175 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹1,145. It will also confirm the head and shoulder reversal pattern on the daily chart. This is a bearish pattern, which may keep the stock under pressure. Investors can hold the long positions taken at ₹1,260, ₹1,245 and ₹1,225. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,180 for the target of ₹1,420.










Tata Steel (₹507.1) 
Tata Steel has been moving higher as expected, but at a slow pace. The stock was up 1 per cent last week. The short-term outlook continues to remain positive. A near-term resistance is at ₹517 — the 100-day moving average. A pull-back from this resistance can trigger a fall to ₹495 and ₹490. A further fall below ₹490 looks unlikely at the moment. An upward reversal from the ₹495-490 support zone will take the stock higher to ₹515 levels again. An eventual break above the 100-day moving average resistance will then increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹545 and ₹550 thereafter. The upmove from the January low of ₹442 is significant as it happened from the 200-week moving average support. Whether the current move is a trend reversal or just a corrective rally will become clear in the coming weeks. Short-term traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹502. Retain the stop-loss at ₹480 for the target of ₹545. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹510 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹517."
34,2019-03-03,ITC,"Five of top 10 firms together add Rs 35,503 crore in m-cap 
Five of the 10 most valued Indian firms together added Rs 35,503 crore in their market valuation last week, with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) topping the chart among the gainers.
While TCS, ITC, Infosys, SBI and ICICI Bank witnessed a rise in their market capitalisation (m-cap) during the trading week ended Friday, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), HDFC Bank, HUL, HDFC and Kotak Mahindra Bank saw losses on the other hand.
TCS saw its valuation rise by Rs 24,671.93 crore to Rs 7,47,343.7 crore, positioning at the top of the ladder among the ten blue-chip firms.
ITC added Rs 4,328.83 crore to Rs 3,40,369.6 crore and Infosys’ valuation gained by Rs 3,407.55 crore to Rs 3,23,782.7 crore.
The m-cap of SBI jumped by Rs 1,963.41 crore to Rs 2,43,597.3 crore and that of ICICI Bank rose by Rs 1,131.27 crore to Rs 2,27,770.4 crore.
On the other hand, the market valuation of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) dropped by Rs 7,110.87 crore to Rs 3,75,555.8 crore.
HDFC’s valuation declined by Rs 4,344.84 crore to Rs 3,19,880.7 crore, and that of RIL fell by Rs 3,739.81 crore to Rs 7,77,564.2 crore.
The m-cap of Kotak Mahindra Bank dropped by Rs 2,757.11 crore to Rs 2,34,039.5 crore and that of HDFC Bank dipped by Rs 2,300.05 crore to Rs 5,67,036.2 crore.
In terms of the m-cap value of these top 10 firms, RIL stood at number one place, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, HUL, ITC, Infosys, HDFC, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank.
Over the last week, the BSE Sensex rose 192.33 points, or 0.57 per cent, to close at 36,063.81."

30,2019-03-19,ITC,"Realty firms can opt for old or new rates for ongoing residential projects


Representative image

   -  P_V_SIVAKUMAR


Real estate developers have the option to adopt a lower rate of Goods and Services Tax (GST) without input tax credit (ITC), or go for the existing rate with ITC.
This applies to ongoing projects (buildings where construction and actual booking have both started before April 1, 2019, but which will not be completed by March 31, 2019). Projects beginning on or after April 1 will fall into the lower GST rate regime automatically.
A decision to this effect was taken by the GST Council at its 34th meeting on Tuesday.
Briefing media persons after the meeting, Revenue Secretary AB Pandey said the Council has approved a transition plan for the new rate structure for real estate residential projects.
At the meeting chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the proposal of options was suggested by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi. It was supported strongly by West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra and others.
Tuesday’s deliberation was a follow-up to the decision taken at last month’s meeting, where the Council had decided on a two-tier rate structure for under-construction flats. Affordable houses will attract 1 per cent GST while for all others it is 5 per cent. There will be no ITC.
Also, in order to curb cash payments, it was decided that at least 80 per cent of the inputs should be purchased from registered dealers, but this will not include the purchase of capital goods.
Pandey further said it has been agreed that developers will be given time to choose one of the two options. This could be 15 days or a month.
He added that the decision will help builders clear inventories. He also expressed hope that prices will not go up; and if there is an escalation, the National Anti-profiteering Authority will look into it.
MS Mani, Partner at Deloitte India, said the pragmatic move to segregate under-construction projects from new projects would provide relief to builders worried about the loss of ITC. This would also enable them to price the loss of input tax credits in the new projects.
Rajat Mohan, Partner at AMRG & Associates, felt the reality sector is already loaded with multiple legislation restrictions. “The sector needs uniform, transparent and unambiguous transition rules for the entire industry,” he said.
Parth Mehta, MD of Paradigm Realty, said the GST Council’s previous announcement was a buyer-centric move, as the affordable housing rates were without ITC. “Since the developers are already facing various headwinds, resulting in shrinking margins and poor cashflow, the decision to avail ITC in ongoing under-construction houses on a proportionate basis will certainly serve as some breather for the developer,” he said."
29,2019-03-31,ITC,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (320.8)
The uptrend in SBI is gaining momentum. The stock surged 7.6 per cent last week, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹305. Resistance is near current levels at around ₹321. A pull-back from that can trigger a corrective fall to ₹315. A break below ₹315 can drag the stock lower to ₹305. However, the bias continues to remain positive. So, a further fall below ₹305 looks less probable. A bounce from ₹305 will have the potential to take the stock above ₹321. In such a scenario, a rally to ₹350 is likely. The indicators on the charts are positive. The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 55-, 100- and 200-day moving averages. This is a strong bullish sign, indicating that the downside could be limited and the uptrend is likely to remain in place. Short-term traders can wait for dips and go long at ₹315 and accumulate at ₹308. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹295 for the target of ₹350. Revise the stop-loss to ₹325 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹335.










ITC (296.7)
ITC was volatile last week. The stock fell initially to a low of ₹291.2 and bounced back to make a high of ₹302.95. However, it fell in the final trading session of the week, giving back all the gains and closed on a flat note. The resistance at ₹302 is holding well. ITC has to make a decisive close above this hurdle to regain strength and move higher. The next target is ₹309. The level of ₹309 is a key long-term trend resistance. Inability to rise past this level can trigger a corrective fall to ₹302 or ₹300. But a strong break above ₹309 will increase the likelihood of the rally extending to ₹320 and ₹322 over the medium term. On the other hand, if ITC continues to trade below ₹302, a dip to ₹293 or ₹290 is possible. Investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at ₹282, ₹278 and ₹272 with a revised stop-loss at ₹289. Move the stop-loss further higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹305. Book profits at ₹310.










Infosys (₹742.3)
Infosys tumbled 3 per cent intraweek and made a low of ₹719.6. However, the stock reversed sharply higher recovering all the loss. The bias remains positive on the chart. The 21-day moving average at ₹726 is a key support. The quick bounce from ₹719 indicates that the stock is getting fresh buyers below ₹726. So as long as the stock trades above the 21-day moving average support, there is a strong likelihood of it moving higher to ₹750-₹755. A further break above ₹755 will then increase the likelihood of the uptrend extending to ₹780. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if Infosys makes a decisive close below the 21-day moving average. A fall to ₹705 or ₹700 is possible. A further fall below ₹700 looks less probable at the moment. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹725, ₹720 and ₹715. Retain the stop-loss at ₹680 for the target of ₹790. Revise the stop-loss to ₹735 as the stock moves up to ₹755.










RIL (₹1,363)
RIL opened the week with a gap-down and fell to a low of ₹1,317.15. However, the negative sentiment was short-lived and RIL clawed back, recovering all the loss and closed 1.5 per cent higher for the week. The support at ₹1,316 mentioned last week has held very well. This leaves the bullish outlook intact. A near-term resistance is at ₹1,385, which is likely to be tested in the coming days. Inability to breach this hurdle can drag the stock lower to ₹1,350 initially. A further break below ₹1,350 will then increase the likelihood of the downmove extending to ₹1,315 or ₹1,310. But, if RIL manages to break above ₹1,385, it can gain fresh strength. In such a scenario, RIL can surge to ₹1,400. A strong break above ₹1,400 will be very bullish from a long-term perspective. This will pave way for ₹1,450 and ₹1,500 over the long term. The outlook for the stock will turn negative only if RIL declines below ₹1,300. Such a break can trigger a corrective fall to ₹1,260 and ₹1,250.










Tata Steel (₹520.8)
Tata Steel continued to consolidate for the fourth consecutive week. The stock has been stuck between ₹505 and ₹532. A breakout on either side of ₹505 or ₹532 will decide the next move. If Tata Steel breaks the range below ₹505, it can fall to ₹495 or ₹490. But such a fall looks less likely as the price action on the chart leaves the possibility high of the stock breaking above ₹532. The stock is well above the 21-week moving average level of ₹507. As long as it trades above this support, the bias will remain positive. A strong break above ₹532 will take Tata Steel to ₹540. A further break above ₹540 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹560 over the medium term. Traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹518 and ₹512. Retain the stop-loss at ₹487 for the target of ₹555. Revise the stop-loss to ₹515 on a rally to ₹525.

27,2019-04-28,ITC,"Check this out: Hotel Leela’s asset monetisation deal 
With the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) restraining Hotel Leelaventures from selling its hotel properties to Brookfield Asset Management pending further investigation, the long-delayed resolution of the company’s debt looks set to be pushed further. SEBI’s move to stonewall a transaction approved by a company’s board and voted on by its shareholders is unusual and has very few precedents no doubt. But SEBI’s intervention in this case is timely and quite welcome, given that the concerns flagged by the company’s minority shareholders merit scrutiny.
Saddled with high debt and insufficient cash flows, Hotel Leela has been attempting to resolve its financial woes since 2012 and has been a defaulter ever since its lenders assigned their debt to JM Financial Asset Restructuring Company. The proposed asset monetisation deal with Brookfield, which envisages the sale of its prime hotel properties in Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Udaipur and Agra for around ₹3,950 crore will allow the company to make substantial inroads into its debt pile. But while the transaction is much-needed for lenders, it raises three red flags for the company’s minority shareholders. One, after the sale of key revenue-generating assets, Hotel Leela will effectively be a shell company with little residual value for equity shareholders. Two, in the absence of a detailed valuation for this ‘slump sale’, shareholders also have no means of knowing if the company has negotiated a fair price for their key assets. Three, while public shareholders are unlikely to receive any payout from this deal, promoter entities are set to pocket at least ₹300 crore through parallel transactions with Brookfield for intellectual property and business expansion services. The Companies Act prohibits companies from disposing of a substantial part of their business without seeking the approval of 75 per cent of their shareholders through a special resolution. While Hotel Leela has put this deal to vote through postal ballot, minority shareholders hold no real power to veto it given that the promoters and JM ARC who together control 73.3 per cent of equity, are likely to be all for it. There’s a clear conflict of interest between JM ARC’s role as a public shareholder and that as a lender gaining from this deal. That’s why institutional shareholders such as ITC and LIC appear justified in lodging complaints with the NCLT and SEBI, calling for the deal’s scrutiny as a related-party transaction.
Minority shareholders may have little to gain from the final verdict, given that Hotel Leela’s net worth of ₹48 crore is inadequate to service the debt of over ₹3,700 crore. But the regulatory rulings in this case will help settle important points of governance on companies disposing of their cash cows, and on voting rules for related-party transactions. It is good to see domestic institutions voicing their opinion on the postal ballot, instead of mutely rubber-stamping management decisions as they usually do."
26,2019-05-05,ITC,"Six of top-10 companies lose Rs 64,219 cr in m-cap 
 The combined market valuation of six of the 10 most valued Indian companies plunged by Rs 64,219.2 crore last week, with IT giant TCS suffering the biggest drop.

bl12_caalw_itc-+BL12_MUMBAI_DEV.jpg.jpg


ITC’s longest serving chief, YC Deveshwar, passed away this morning. He was 72 and is survived by his wife and two children.
It was under his leadership that the company diversified from a cigarette major to other non-cigarette sectors that include FMCG, hotels, paperboards, agri and so on. His tenure saw over 50-fold rise in market capitalisation of the company to nearly ₹ 3,00,000 crore. (Presently, it is around Rs 3,50,000 crore.)
Hospitality was very close to his heart. During his two-decade-long stewardship, ITC’s hotel network grew from merely 12 to over 100 properties, operated under four major brands — ITC, Welcom, Fortune and Welcom Heritage.
He received the Padma Bhushan, India’s third highest civilian award, in 2011. Deveshwar, was born in February 1947 in Lahore. He studied at IIT Delhi and then went on to pursue management course at Harvard University. He joined ITC in 1968 and became its Executive Chairman in 1996.
Deveshwar took charge at a time when ITC Ltd was going through one of its worst crisis. The company was facing tax demands and a probe for alleged foreign exchange violations.
Further worsening the situation was the fact that initial attempts at diversifying, before his tenure, had gone haywire and its key foreign shareholder British American Tobacco Plc (BAT) was pushing ahead for greater control.
Within two years of taking charge, Deveshwar cut losses and ITC got out of the edible oils and financial services businesses. He managed to keep BAT from taking control of ITC by harnessing the support of Indian institutional shareholders — Life Insurance Corporation of India and the erstwhile Unit Trust of India.
Subsequently, he re-drew plans for ITC to foray into the new business segments; thereby making it the diversified conglomerate that it is today.
Deveshwar will also be credited with developing “world-class Indian brands” that have created value for the country.  At least, 25 mother brands like 'Aashirvaad', 'Bingo!', 'Classmate' among others. His focus on sustainable and inclusive growth for all stakeholders has been acclaimed globally. His ‘e-choupal’ is one such noted model.
Deveshwar wilfully relinquished his executive role as Chairman and CEO of the company after 21 years at the helm in February 2017.
Subsequently, Sanjiv Puri — who was handpicked by Deveshwar — was elevated as MD. Deveshwar, at the insistence of the Board, operated as the non-executive Chairman.
Recalling Deveshwar’s “legendary stewardship”, Sanjiv Puri, MD, ITC said: “We recall with respect and pride the legendary stewardship he provided to the company over two decades as its Chairman.”
According to Puri, Deveshwar’s leadership transformed ITC into a valuable and admired multi business conglomerate with a robust portfolio of front-ranking businesses in FMCG, Hotels, paperboards & paper, packaging and agri-business."

Politicians and industry captains came together as they mourned the death of YC Deveshwar, the man who transformed ITC from a cigarette-maker to a diversified conglomerate. Deveshwar passed away on Saturday at the age of 72. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi through a tweet referred to the “strong contribution” by Deveshwar towards the Indian industry. “Shri YC Deveshwar made a strong contribution to the Indian industry. His efforts helped ITC become a professionally-run Indian company with global footprint. Saddened by his demise. My thoughts are with his family friends and the ITC group in this hour of grief,” he wrote on the micro-blogging site. 
Deveshwar was also a member of the Board of Trade, Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry; and a member of the National Food Processing Development Council, Ministry of Food Processing Industries. 
West Bengal Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee, too mourned Deveshwar’s death. In a tweet, Banerjee wrote: “Saddened at the passing away of YC Devshwar ji. He was giant in the corporate world. I have many memories of him as a distinguished industry captain.”

Amongst the trade bodies, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) pointed out to the many “innovative initiatives for competitiveness” that Deveshwar took when he was the President of the body in 2005-06. “It is a great loss for us in CII which he led with exemplary commitment. He drove the mission to converge, people, planet and profit for including multiple objectives in the business development strategy,” said Chandrajit Banerjee, DG, CII. “ Sustainable development was a special proactive mission that Deveshwar drove personally,” he added. 
According to Assocham President, BK Sharma, the e-Choupal initiative, which combined scientific names and agricultural practices in states like Madhya Pradesh, Andhra and others remain “unparalleled”. “Deveshwar pioneered the growth of ITC as a model corporate citizen which redefined sustainable business and prioritised working closely with farmers and valuable stakeholders,” he pointed out. 
 Amongst the other city based businessmen, Mayank Jalan, CMD, Keventer Agro, called this a “huge loss for industry”. According to him, Deveshwar was an inspirational leader and a role model, who was instrumental in putting Kolkata on the global map. 
“Kolkata’s business community has always looked up to him and had deep respect as he was instrumental in putting Kolkata on the global map,” Jalan said in a statement. 
Naveen Jindal, Chairman, Jindal Steel and Power, also tweeted pointing out Deveshwar’s death was a “big loss to India Inc and the nation”. “His demise is a big loss to India Inc and the nation. He was an inspirational man and I admired him greatly,” he wrote on the micro-blogging site. 
Harsh V Goenka, Chairman, RPG Enterprises also lamented at the passing away of a “friend” and a “titan”. He pointed out in his tweet that Deveshwar built ITC where the ‘I’ stands for ‘Indian successful brands’; the ‘T’ for “tobacco to a FMCG and hotel conglomerate” and the ‘C’ for “corporate of great strength”. “A titan, a friend, Yogi Deveshwar passes away making the Indian corporate world poorer,” he wrote.

Resistance may cap upside in SBI
SBI (₹308.05)










SBI tumbled over 5 per cent intra-week, breaking below the key support level of ₹302. However, it clawed back from the low of ₹292.2, recovering almost all the loss after the fourth-quarter results announcement on Friday. Though the weekly candle gives a mixed signal, the daily chart is relatively positive. A key support is at ₹302, which can limit the downside; resistance is at ₹313. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹321-322. A pull-back from ₹322 can trigger a corrective fall to ₹312. But a strong break above ₹322 will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹330-335. Given the weakness in the broader markets, such a strong rally looks less probable. So the upside is likely to be limited to ₹322 at the moment. On the other hand, if SBI fails to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹313, a fall to ₹302 or even ₹297 is possible. As such, the impact of Friday's results will be short-lived and the overall negative sentiment in the market could weigh on the stock. In that case, SBI can fall to ₹ 290 and ₹287.
Uptrend in ITC under threat
ITC (₹297.7)










ITC moved up in the initial part of the week but failed to sustain higher. The uptrend that has been in place since late February seems to be under threat. A key support is at ₹295 which is likely to be tested in the near term. The stock has to hold above this support in order to keep the sentiment positive. A break below ₹295 can drag the stock initially lower to ₹288-287. A further break below ₹287 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹280-278. Such a fall to ₹280-278 will be a good buying opportunity from a long-term perspective. Investors with a long-term perspective can take long positions at ₹285 and accumulate at ₹282 and ₹278. On the other hand, if ITC manages to sustain above ₹295 in the coming days, a bounce to ₹302 — the crucial 21-day moving average resistance — is possible. The stock has to surpass this hurdle to bring back the bullish momentum. Else, a pull-back to ₹295 is possible again. In that case, ITC can remain range-bound between ₹295 and ₹302 for some time.
Infosys can witness a fresh fall
Infosys (₹716.05)










Infosys has crucial supports in the ₹706-703 region, which can be tested in the near term. It’s ability to sustain above this support zone will decide its next move. A bounce from the ₹706-703 support region will ease the downside pressure. It will increase the possibility of the stock moving higher to ₹730-735 in the short term. It will also keep the broader ₹700-775 sideways range intact. Infosys has been trading in this range since mid-January. But if the stock breaks below ₹703 in the coming days, it will come under renewed pressure. Such a break will take the stock initially lower to ₹690-685. A further break below ₹685 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹670-665 on profit-booking. Indicators on the chart favour a decline below ₹703 and a fall to ₹670-665 in the coming weeks. However, the region between ₹670 and ₹665 is a crucial long-term support, which may halt the fall. A decisive bounce from the ₹670-665 support zone could be a good buying opportunity from a long-term perspective.
Outlook turns bearish for RIL
RIL (₹1,250.5)










Contrary to an expectation of a rise, RIL tumbled 11 per cent last week. Morgan Stanley, a global brokerage firm, downgrading the stock seems to have made investors book profits, triggering this sharp sell-off. The uptrend that has been in place since October 2018 has reversed, and the outlook has turned bearish. Though there is some support near the current levels, the broader picture is negative. So, any bounce from the current levels may be short-lived and could be restricted to ₹1,300-1,320. A further fall to ₹1,200-1,180 is possible in the coming days. The region around ₹1,180 is a strong long-term trend support which can halt the fall. A bounce from there will be bullish from a long-term perspective. Investors can start buying RIL at ₹1,200 and also accumulate at ₹1,285 and ₹1,295. However, the possibility of a prolonged sideways move between ₹1,180 and ₹1,300 cannot be ruled out after this fall. As such, the rally to fresh highs thereafter might take time. So, investors buying around ₹1,200 will need to be patient and hold the stock for a long period of time.
Down-move to extend in Tata Steel
Tata Steel (₹487.3)










Tata Steel tumbled 11 per cent last week. Reports that the company’s joint venture with German steel maker Thyssenkrupp may not go through was a major trigger for the sell-off in the stock last week. The resistance at ₹560 has held well. It also keeps intact the downtrend that has been in place since January 2018. A strong resistance is in the ₹505-510 region which can cap the upside. A rally beyond ₹510 looks unlikely now. Also, an intermediate bounce to this resistance zone is likely to find fresh sellers coming into the market. A fall to ₹455-450 or even ₹440 is likely in the coming days. A further break below ₹440 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹425 or even ₹400. Traders with a short-term perspective can make use of rallies to go short at ₹498 and ₹505. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹522 for the target of ₹455. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹490 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹475.

22,2019-05-13,ITC,"An institution that was YC Deveshwar
I did not know Yogesh Chander Deveshwar personally. I have, however, been in a few industry body meetings with him over the years. I knew his predecessors well — I overlapped with JN Sapru as a board member in my first CEO role for a few years where he was a great mentor, and I had the privilege of working with KL Chugh on the All India Management Association (AIMA) agenda where he was past president.
YCD as he is popularly known leaves a huge legacy at ITC, in industry and in society. Tributes have been pouring in from political and business leaders. The business world will remember him for five things amongst his many significant achievements:
Dreaming big: He set an audacious goal of being a ₹100,000 crore FMCG company by 2030. For a cigarette company to aim that high was not ordinary. There is only one previous example of a company pivoting to a new business with such ambition and that was IBM under Lou Gerstner — moving from a hardware to a services company.
Many leaders set audacious targets but very few have the patience to steer their firms through. The ITC transformation journey is one of audacious goals with deep patience, patience shown by YCD.
The One ITC strategy: This involved leveraging the company’s assets as tobacco consumption declined. A declining industry saps managerial energy, distributor interest and retailer commitment. ITC is the only company that leveraged its pan shop coverage to sell a newer range, and leveraged its existing managerial capability as it entered hotels, food, fashion, e-chaupal, stationery, agarbathis, etc.
It created the concept of ‘One ITC’ distributor, an idea that every other big company has tried but not succeeded because of internal managerial egos and battles. The One distributor concept has given ITC a huge advantage in FMCG. For instance, every ITC hotel carries the full range of ITC products — potato chips, cookies, chocolates in the mini bar, shampoo, soaps and creams in the bathroom.
Building Indian brands: ITC has been able to achieve this by stretching existing tobacco brands, building new ones and acquiring new ones. ITC is owner of the largest set of consumer brands in India and very few people recognise that. ITC was always a brand company but few people gave it credit because they would always say that tobacco is a protected industry.
Over the last two decades with YCD at the helm, ITC has built 50 big brands. It is a brand powerhouse today. Many of the brands have been built integrating the Indian farmer and his produce — be it tobacco, potato, or fruits.
Staying a premium business In every sphere ITC has been committed to providing high quality products and services while being sustainable in every aspect of the business.
ITC is one of the few big companies which is water positive, carbon positive, and nearly half its energy needs are met from renewable sources. Truly a great commitment to sustainability.
Many premium businesses have offered lower price brands but ITC has not gone down that route. It tried such an approach in cigarettes but quickly scrapped it. The strategy of staying true to being a high quality, premium branded business is something that ITC shares with another top company — Procter and Gamble.
Adaptability: YCD was away from ITC and did a stint as the Managing Director of Air India from 1991 to 1994. Very few leaders move from running a private enterprise to running a public enterprise — some celebrated examples are Robert McNamara in the US, the first Indian chairman of Hindustan Lever Prakash Tandon, and Nandan Nilekani. By all accounts Air India did well during his tenure and such a move teaches leader adaptability.
ITC has been in India since 1910, a total of 109 years, and YCD worked for the company for 51 years. He was a board member for 35 years and a CEO for 23 years, 21 of them as executive chairman. YCD has been at the helm for nearly 30 per cent of ITC’s life in India, that’s a legacy almost no other professional leader of a private enterprise can dream of.
In his stint at ITC, the company grew from being an outpost to a lighthouse. RIP YCD, you have done more than what one can do in a lifetime.

Corporate visionary
   -  PTI




Corporate visionary
   -  PTI


The passing away of YC Deveshwar, who led ITC for over two decades without owning it, is an important landmark which provides us an opportunity to take a look at one of India’s largest, most successful and widely known corporates.
Traditionally, ITC aroused more than ordinary interest for being one of the two most prominent (the other being Larsen & Toubro) professionally run companies (leaving aside the Tatas, of course). In a country where despite decades of progress towards companies becoming widely held and professionally managed, promoters still call the shots when it comes to the crunch, this remains an issue. At a time when promoters are most reluctant to let go of hugely loss making companies even after they have come under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the value of professionals calling all the shots in the companies they manage gets highlighted.
Deveshwar’s role in ITC is also historically important because he played a key part in making it a fully Indian company. ITC which began as part of the global conglomerate BAT, faced an attempt by it to fully assert control by acquiring 51 per cent during the 1990s. His ability to access political support and hence the backing of financial institution shareholders became apparent during this battle with BAT.
Another key initiative, which currently defines ITC, is its attempt to be more than just a cigarettes company which has to bear all the adverse image load that goes with the cancer stick. ITC has now broad based itself into a company with interest in food, paper, hospitality, information technology and more. The group’s non-cigarette business now (2018) accounts for nearly half of total turnover.
But when it comes to the bottomline, it is still cigarettes that play a big part. In 2018, profit before tax from cigarettes came to ₹14,128 crore, whereas profits from non-cigarette business came to ₹2,326 crore, that is only 14 per cent of profits from cigarettes.
In comparison, Britannia Industries, which is also extensively into packaged foods, earned a profit before tax (2018) of ₹1,445 crore on a turnover of ₹9,282 crore. While the attempt to kick the dependence on cigarettes is laudable, ITC still has a long way to go before the non-cigarette business can earn a healthy profit.
ITC’s attempt to move with the times, in fact be a bit ahead of it, is illustrated by its innovation of the e-choupal. Nearly two decades ago it started this exercise of using digital technology to help farmers by offering them a way out of total dependence on traditional mandis to sell their produce. The initiative, other than helping in price discovery and creating a scope for transparent trading, also offered education and information to farmers to better their farming techniques.
To keep up with the times, ITC is set to launch the e-choupal 4.0, a mobile application that will act as a platform for agri-business start-ups which can take the e-choupal forward. Once this gets going ITC will stop opening new e-choupals of its own.
Another initiative of ITC which has attracted wide attention is promoting “responsible luxury” in the way ITC hotels are run. It has done this by addressing issues like waste recycling and management and energy conservation. As a result of this eight ITC luxury hotels have won the platinum award of LEED (Leadership in Engineering and Environment Design). ITC Hotels has consequently won the accolade of being the “greenest luxury hotel chain in the world”.
Harvard Business Review has done case studies on the e-choupal and “responsible luxury” projects. Deveshwar, a product of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi and also a Harvard Business School awardee, led ITC through this entire transformation. He joined it in 1968 and had been with the organisation through his entire working life, except for a four-year period in the early nineties when he became Chairman and Managing Director of Air India.
This was part of the exercise then undertaken by the government to bring professional managers into the public sector, underlining his status as a professional manager. He ended his stint as executive chairman in 2017 and continued as non-executive chairman.
The media has highlighted that during his chairmanship, ITC’s revenue grew by 11 times, shareholder return by a compound annual rate of 23 per cent and rapid rise in market capitalisation made it the fifth most valuable company in the country. It has to be remembered that cigarette sales have played a role in rapid topline growth and market capitalisation is driven by investor confidence that cigarette smokers will find it hard to kick the habit. Thus overall ITC under Deveshwar deserves praise for trying to reduce dependence on cigarettes, and particularly for great ideas like e-choupal and “responsible luxury”. The latter is hugely important at a time when concern over global warming is at a peak.

SBI (₹343.8)
SBI was stuck in a narrow range between ₹339 and ₹349 last week. The near-term outlook is mixed. SBI can trade sideways between the significant support at ₹335 and resistance at ₹350 for some time. Within this range, there is a strong likelihood of the stock falling to ₹335 — the lower end of the range in the early part of this week. A breakout on either side of ₹335 or ₹350 will decide the direction of the next move. A break below ₹335 can take SBI lower to ₹325 and ₹320. As being reiterated over the last couple of weeks, the region around ₹320 is a strong long-term resistance-turned-support, which can limit the downside. Fresh buyers are likely to emerge around this level. As such, a fall to ₹325-₹320 will be a good buying opportunity from a medium-term perspective. On the other hand, if SBI breaks above ₹350, it can move up to the next crucial resistance level of ₹362. SBI has to rise past ₹362 decisively to gain fresh bullish momentum. Targets above ₹362 are ₹390 and ₹400.










ITC (₹277.9)
 ITC has been managing to sustain above the crucial long-term support level of ₹275. However, the stock is not gaining strength for a strong rally. This indicates lack of fresh buying interest in the stock. ITC has to break above ₹282 to get a breather. Such a break can take it up towards ₹287 and ₹290. Only a strong rise past ₹290 will confirm the trend reversal, which will then pave way for the next targets of ₹300 and ₹310. But such a strong upmove looks unlikely at the moment. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average and is now on the verge of crossing below the 100-day moving average. This is a negative signal, indicating that the upside could be limited. It also keeps the possibilities open of the stock breaking below `275. As such, if ITC breaks below ₹275, the downside pressure will increase. In such a scenario, the current downtrend will remain intact and the stock can extend the fall to ₹265 and ₹260 thereafter. 










Infosys (₹740.4)
 Infosys moved up last week as expected, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹758.9 and reversed sharply lower, giving back almost all the gains. The resistance at ₹755 has held well. Key near-term supports are at ₹734 (21-week moving average) and ₹730 (21-day moving average), which are likely to limit the downside. A break and fall below ₹730 looks less probable now. As long as the stock trades above ₹730, the outlook will remain positive. An upward reversal from the ₹734-₹730 support zone can take the stock higher to ₹755 again. An eventual break above ₹755 will then take Infosys up to ₹770 and ₹775 — the upper end of the ₹695-₹775 sideways range. The stock has been stuck in this broad sideways range since mid-January this year. If it manages to rise past ₹775, it can gain fresh momentum and target ₹790 and ₹800. But a pull-back from ₹775 will keep the sideways range intact. In such a scenario, Infosys can fall-back initially to ₹760-₹750 and even lower thereafter. 










RIL (₹1,316.95)
RIL managed to sustain above ₹1,300 but is not gaining strength to move higher. The price action over the last few weeks increases the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,300. Inability to rise past ₹1,338 (55-day moving average) and a subsequent fall last week, strengthens the case for a fall below ₹1,300. RIL will come under renewed pressure on a break below ₹1,300 and can move lower to ₹1,280-1,275. This move could be sharp and swift. A further break below 1,275 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to 1,250 and even 1,220 over the medium term. On the other hand, if RIL manages to sustain above 1,300, a bounce to 1,338 is possible again. A break above 1,338 will then increase the possibility of the upmove extending to 1,350 and 1,360. The region between 1,360 and 1,365 is a crucial resistance. RIL has to rise past 1,365 to gain fresh momentum and target 1,400 and 1,430. But such a strong upmove looks unlikely at the moment. 










Tata Steel (₹501.4)
 Contrary to our expectation of a fall, Tata Steel surged last week. The stock was up 4 per cent. Support for the stock is in the ₹490-488 region. As long as the stock trades above this support zone, the near-term outlook will remain positive. A rise to ₹515-520 is likely. The region around 520 is a crucial long-term trend resistance. As such, Tata Steel has to rise past ₹520 decisively to turn the outlook bullish and also to signal a trend reversal. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹527-530. A further break above ₹530 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its upmove to ₹560 over the medium term. Inability to breach ₹520 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹500 and ₹490. A break below ₹490 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹460. In such a scenario, Tata Steel can trade in a sideways range between ₹460 and ₹520.

SBI (₹342.5)
SBI tumbled 3.8 per cent last week, breaking below the key support level of ₹350. The next support near ₹335 is holding well as of now. As long as SBI sustains above this support, a corrective rally to ₹350 is possible in the near term. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹350 are needed to ease the downside pressure and bring back the bullish sentiment. But a rally beyond ₹350 looks less probable now as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels. A pull-back from ₹350 can drag the stock lower to ₹335 again. An eventual break below the key base level of ₹335 will then increase the likelihood of the downtrend resuming and declining to ₹328. The level of ₹328 is a strong support where both the 21-week moving average as well as a trend-line support are poised. As such the current down-move can halt around ₹328 and a bounce to ₹335-340 is possible from there. But if SBI declines below ₹328, the down-move can extend to ₹320 in the ensuing weeks.










ITC (₹270.3)
ITC fell over a per cent in the initial part of the week, but managed to bounce thereafter. The stock made a low of ₹264.4 and reversed higher recovering all the loss. The 200-week moving average support is holding well as of now. However, a key resistance is at ₹273 (21-day moving average) which has to be breached to get a breather. A strong break above ₹273 can trigger a corrective rally to ₹278 and ₹282. The region between ₹282 and ₹285 is a strong resistance which is likely to cap the upside. A rise past ₹285 looks unlikely at the moment. On the other hand, if ITC fails to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹273 in the coming days, it can dip to test ₹263 again. A sideways consolidation between ₹263 and ₹273 is possible for some time. The bias will remain bearish. An eventual break below ₹263 can take the stock initially lower to ₹257. A further break below ₹257 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹245 – a strong long-term support.
 






Infosys (₹787.3)
Infosys rose last week to test ₹800 as expected, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹804.25 and oscillated between ₹782 and ₹805 all through the week. The near-term outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹780 and resistance at ₹800. The stock can trade sideways between ₹780 and ₹800 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹780 or ₹800 will then determine the direction of the next move. A break below ₹780 can trigger profit-booking and drag the stock lower to ₹765. A cluster of supports is poised in the band between ₹765 and ₹750. So the downside could be limited to ₹750 if the stock declines below ₹780. On the other hand, if Infosys manages to sustain above ₹780, the bias will remain positive. It will keep the possibility high of the stock breaking above ₹800. Such a break above ₹800 will give a fresh boost to the stock. It will also indicate the resumption of the uptrend and take the stock up to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks.










RIL (₹1,214.1)
RIL tumbled 2.8 per cent, breaking below the crucial support level of ₹1,250. The price action over the last month indicates that the stock has been lacking strong buyers to take it above ₹1,300. This coupled with the sharp fall below ₹1,250 gives an initial sign of the long-term uptrend getting reversed. A further fall below the psychological level of ₹1,200 will confirm the same. Such a fall will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹1,130-1,120 in the coming weeks. The move below ₹1,200 could be sharp and swift as it could trigger strong profit-booking. But, if RIL manages to sustain above ₹1,200, a bounce to ₹1,250 is possible. In such a scenario, a sideways move in the ₹1,200-1,250 band can be seen for some time. RIL has to rise past ₹1,250 decisively to ease the downside pressure. A rise to ₹1,300 is possible on a break above ₹1,250. But such a strong up-move looks unlikely at the moment as fresh sellers are likely to emerge around ₹1,250 levels and cap the upside. 










Tata Steel (₹445.2)
Tata Steel extended its fall and kept the downtrend intact. The stock was down 2.8 per cent last week. An immediate resistance is in the ₹448-450 region and the next significant one is at ₹470, which can cap the upside. A rise past ₹470 looks unlikely. Tata Steel is likely to tumble towards ₹400 in the coming weeks. The region around ₹400 is a key support. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement support is also poised around ₹400. As such, the current fall can halt at ₹400. A corrective rally to ₹450 is possible if Tata Steel manages to bounce from ₹400. But the upside of this corrective rally is likely to be capped at ₹450. But if the stock fails to bounce from ₹400 and falls further, the downside pressure will increase. The break below ₹400 will see the stock tumbling to ₹350 or lower over the medium term.

SBI can face resistance ahead
After taking a breather in the week earlier, SBI resumed its fall and tumbled 6.8 per cent last week. Though there is a possibility to see a near-term corrective bounce, the broader picture remains weak. A strong resistance at ₹280 can cap the rally. A consolidation between ₹260 and ₹280 for a week cannot be ruled out. The indicators on the charts remain bearish, keeping the doors open for further fall. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average — a bearish cross-over indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, SBI is likely to keep the downtrend intact and break below ₹260 in the coming days. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹250-245. A further break below ₹245 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹230. The broad region between ₹240 and ₹230 is a strong support zone which can halt the current downtrend. A corrective rally, thereafter, to ₹270-280 cannot be ruled out. But a strong break below ₹230 will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling further to ₹190-180 over the medium term.










ITC breaks crucial long-term support
ITC is under pressure. The stock plummeted 6.8 per cent last week. This sharp fall has dragged the stock well below the crucial long-term support level of ₹240. We will have to wait and see if ITC sustains below ₹240 and confirms the break. It has to reverse sharply higher and close decisively above ₹243 to get a breather. In such scenario, the chances of seeing a further fall will get reduced, and a corrective rally to ₹255 and ₹260 is possible. But an inability to bounce above ₹243 can take ITC lower to the next key support level of ₹228.5. If it manages to hold above this support, it can consolidate between ₹228 and ₹243 for some time. But as long as ITC trades below ₹243, it will remain under pressure. An eventual break below ₹228.5 will confirm the break of the long-term uptrend and intensify the fall further. Such a break will see the stock tumbling further towards the next major support levels of ₹211 and ₹207. It will also keep the possibilities high of the stock extending the fall even up to ₹200 and ₹190.










Infosys to remain range-bound
Infosys broke the ₹755-805 range on the upside last week, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹809.95 and came off slightly from there to close just below the upper end of the ₹755-805 range. The stock was up 3.5 per cent last week. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹805 are needed to confirm the range breakout. A key support is at ₹789. As long as Infosys remains above this support, there is a strong likelihood of the stock breaking the range above ₹805. Such a break will boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks. But if the stock remains below ₹805, a narrow range-bound move between ₹789 and ₹805 is possible in the near term. A break below ₹789 will reduce the chances of the stock breaching ₹805. Such a break will see an initial dip to ₹785. A further break below ₹785 will then strengthen the downmove and drag the stock lower to ₹768 and ₹763. In that case, the ₹755-805 range will continue to remain intact.










 
Near-term outlook is unclear for RIL
RIL fell sharply by 4 per cent intra-week to make a low of ₹1,226.8. However, it managed to claw back on Friday, recovering all the loss. RIL has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹1,225 and ₹1,304 over the past couple of weeks. This leaves the near-term outlook mixed. As mentioned last week, RIL can consolidate sideways between ₹1,215 and ₹1,305. A breakout on either side of ₹1,215 or ₹1,305 will determine the direction of the next move. Though the strong bounce on Friday keeps the bias positive, weakness in the broader markets may play spoil sport. As such, the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,215 in the coming days cannot be ruled out. Such a break will bring renewed pressure on the stock and increase the chances of it revisiting ₹1,150 and ₹1,100 levels in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if RIL breaks above ₹1,305 decisively, it will gain fresh momentum. In such a scenario, the stock can surge to ₹1,400. An eventual break above ₹1,400 will then pave way for a further rally to ₹1,480 over the medium term.










The downtrend remains intact in Tata Steel. The stock tumbled 5 per cent last week. It has plummeted over 30 per cent over the last eight weeks. The support in the ₹330-320 zone mentioned last week is holding well as of now. But the indicators on the charts are bearish. The 21-week moving average is on the verge of crossing below the 200-week moving average. This is a negative signal indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, it can continue to remain under pressure and any intermediate bounce could be short-lived. An immediate resistance is in the ₹353-355 region which can cap the upside in the near term and keep the stock under pressure. An eventual break below ₹320 will see the fall extending to ₹300 and even lower going forward. Also, as being reiterated in this column over the past few weeks, the current downtrend — which has been in place since 2018 — looks strong. It has the potential to drag Tata Steel lower to ₹250-230 in the coming months.

16,2019-08-28,ITC,"Soap makers reduce prices to boost sales 
 Leading soap manufacturers have slashed prices on their products following lower palm oil prices to tackle muted growth in the sector.
 Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has reduced the prices of its popular soap brands– Lux and Lifebuoy – last month.
 “HUL does selective and judicious price changes across its portfolio in the normal course of its business. Given that the commodity prices are expected to remain benign for certain time period, we have taken price reductions in range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent in Lux and Lifebuoy portfolio, while it may be higher on certain packs in order to pass on the benefits to the consumers,” HUL said in a statement.
 Wipro Consumer Care, makers of Santoor soap, has also slashed the prices.
 “...we have also cut prices in soaps, passing on the benefit of lower raw material prices to the consumer. We believe this will help increase consumption,” said Wipro Consumer Care president (India consumer care business) Anil Chugh.
 Kolkata-based multi-conglomerate ITC also cut prices due to lower raw material cost about 5-6 weeks back.
 “ITC passed on the benefit of lower raw material costs to consumers through a downward revision in prices about 5-6 weeks back in certain packs of its soap variants,” said an ITC spokesperson.
 Data analytics firm Nielsen, in a report, had last month said that in April-June quarter, sales of FMCG items, including soaps, have slowed down.
 “... this quarter has witnessed a slowdown across all food as well as non-food categories with Salty Snacks, Biscuits, Spices, Toilet Soaps, and Packaged tea leading the slowdown,” Nielsen had said."

SBI (₹291.7)
After trading within a range, SBI began to head north and gained throughout the week, breaking above the critical resistance at ₹280. In fact, it was the biggest weekly gain for the stock in the past 16 weeks, moving up by 6.5 per cent. The weekly chart of SBI shows a morning star candlestick pattern, indicating a potential reversal in the medium-term trend. The stock has also moved past its 21-day moving average, which also indicates strongbuying interest in the past week. The daily relative strength index has crossed the mid-point level of 50 after nearly two months, and the moving average convergence divergence indicator also points upwards, implying considerable strength in the bullish trend. Assuming that the prevailing bullish sentiment will help the stock go up further, breaking a resistance at ₹292 will help the stock move towards the ₹300 levels and beyond in the medium term. But if the stock witnesses profit-booking or reacts to the resistance and slides lower, it might decline to ₹288 levels, below which the support is at ₹280.
 










 
ITC (₹239.9)
ITC continues to be held within the ₹240-247 limits. After testing the upper limit of the range at ₹247 — where the 21-day moving average level too coincides — failed to break above and corrected from that level towards the lower limit of the range at ₹240. Most of the decline was during the last two trading sessions, when the stock lost 1.6 per cent. The daily relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator remains flat, implying a lack of trend. Hence, unless the stock breaks either of the limits of the consolidation range, it is better to stay away from initiating new positions. If the weakness in the latter part of the previous week pulls down the price of the scrip further and it goes below ₹240, the immediate support lies at ₹236. If the stock declines below ₹236, the sell-off could intensify and the price might tumble to ₹224 levels. Alternatively, a bounce from the current level will result in the stock inching up towards ₹247 in the upcoming week, beyond which it will face a resistance in the band between ₹250 and ₹252 levels.
 










 
Infosys (₹829.3)
The stock of Infosys could not continue its uptrend. The stock corrected in the past week when the price dropped to a low of ₹810.85, after opening the week a bit lower at ₹836.80 against ₹840.15 — its previous week close. The stock was supported by 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bullish swing at ₹814. And, on Friday, the stock recovered some of its losses as it opened the session at ₹818.65 and closed higher at ₹829.3 levels. The scrip still trades above 21-day moving average, thereby not posing any immediate threat to the prevailing bullish trend. The relative strength index continue to feature in bullish zone. Hence, if the stock regains the momentum and goes up, it will most likely appreciate towards a lifetime high at ₹847 and even to ₹875 levels in medium term. On the other hand, if the stock is weighed down by factors such as profit-booking or a stronger rupee, it is most likely to drift towards the support band between ₹800 and ₹804 — the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of previous swing in the coming week.
 










 
RIL (₹1225.6)
Reliance Industries continues to trade within a tight range — between ₹1,200 and ₹1,240. The upside for the stock is blocked by the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, essentially lying in the same price area, near the ₹1,240 levels. A prolonged consolidation might reduce the significance of both the moving averages, unless the stock moves out of the band. . The relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator plotted on the daily chart of the stock stay direction-less, failing to provide any clue about the upcoming trend. So, until the stock breaks out of the tight price range within which it is oscillating, it might prove costly to make any directional bets. In case the stock moves up buoyed by the positive sentiment in the equity benchmarks and breaches ₹1,240, it is very likely that the price will appreciate to ₹1,300 levels, thereby moving past both the moving average, which may also push RSI above 50. However, if the stock breaks the lower boundary of the range, immediate support is at ₹1,180 and ₹1,140 thereafter.
 










Tata Steel (₹367.35)
Tata Steel edged up last week and closed with a weekly gain of 3.4 per cent. Thus, the share price of the steel major has posted gains for the second consecutive week. The stock has moved beyond the 21-day moving average, as it witnessed some buying interest in the past two weeks. On Friday, the scrip, after opening at ₹367.05, closed the day at ₹367.35 — the 38 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend. Though the stock made a high of ₹379.5 on Thursday, it could not hold on, declining and closing the session at ₹365.05, witnessing some selling pressure. Daily candle on Thursday is a shooting star pattern, meaning there are chances for reversal in the trend. The relative strength index too is nearing the mid-point of 50, and a decisive break above that level may help the stock appreciate further towards ₹395 levels. On the other hand, if the stock price depreciates from the current levels, it will most probably retest ₹350 — the 21-day moving average — below which it could tumble to ₹330 levels."

SBI (₹301.7)
SBI began the week marginally lower at ₹288.2 compared with the previous week close of ₹291.7. The stock declined further to ₹273 levels during the earlier part of the week. However, on Friday, it surged with huge volumes and closed the day with 10 per cent gain. It also moved past resistances at ₹292 and ₹300, closing the week at ₹301.7, posting a considerable weekly gain of 3.4 per cent. Before moderating to ₹301.7, the stock registered a high of ₹307.65, where the 50-day moving average lies. There’s a resistance in the band between ₹305.1 — the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level — and ₹307.65. With the daily relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator pointing upwards and the stock breaking above ₹300, the current rally may continue to push the stock price up to ₹318 and then to ₹320 levels. Alternatively, if the stock slides down after testing the resistance band between ₹307.65 and ₹305.1, it might decline to ₹292 levels.










ITC (₹238.05)
ITC, the stock price of which has been trading in a range between ₹240 and ₹247, declined below the lower limit on Tuesday. The stock retested a support at ₹234.65, from where the price attempted to recover twice in the past one month. However, on both occasions, the recovery was blocked by resistance at ₹247. As a result, the stock seems to have formed a broader range between ₹234.65 and ₹247. Even on Friday, after appreciating to the resistance at ₹247, the stock could not hold on and gave up most of its gains towards the end of the session. The scrip closed the week at ₹238.05. Hence, for the stock to start trending, it must either decisively break above ₹247 or below ₹234.6. In case the stock attracts buying interest and moves past the resistance at ₹247, it may appreciate towards the resistance band between ₹250 and ₹252. But if the stock slips below ₹234, the sell-off could intensify and the price might tumble to ₹224 levels.










Infosys (₹805)
The stock of Infosys was consolidating for the week after a mute opening on Monday. But on Friday, the stock price of the IT major slumped and it lost 1.9 per cent during the session. It closed below 21-day moving average, indicating a potential reversal in short-term trend. With a close at ₹805, the stock has also breached a support at ₹814, where the 38.2 per cent of Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bullish swing coincides. Currently, the fall is arrested by a support in the band between ₹800 and ₹804. The relative strength index has crossed below the mid-point of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence too shows weakness, indicating further depreciation. Hence, if the price breaks below ₹800, it could fall to the support at ₹793, where the important 61.8 Fibonacci retracement level coincides. The 50-day moving average is at ₹792, making that price area a significant support. But if the price recovers from the current level, it may rally to ₹814.










RIL (₹1254.35)
The stock price of Reliance Industries was trading without showing any trend till Thursday. However, on Friday, after making an intra-day low of ₹1,174.3, the stock price rose rapidly and closed at ₹1254.35. Intra-day gain of the stock stood at 6.4 per cent. It registered an intra-day high of ₹1,269.9, which is also the month-to-date high. That way, it has breached a considerable resistance at ₹1,240. The stock has also zoomed past both the 21- and 50-day moving averages. Hence, the prevailing positive sentiment opens the door for the stock to appreciate towards ₹1,300, which is a key level from a medium-term perspective. This is because beyond ₹1,300, the stock has the potential to turn the medium-term trend bullish. Alternatively, in a less likely scenario where the stock moderates from the current levels, the price band between ₹1,230 and ₹1,240 will act as a solid support, limiting the correction. The probability of the price declining below these levels is low.










Tata Steel (₹368.55)
The share price of Tata Steel looked unsteady as it began the week at ₹362 and slid to ₹342 levels, moving below the support at ₹350. On Friday though, on the back of broad-based buying, the stock price went up, reclaiming the previous week high of ₹379.5. Interestingly, the stock faced selling pressure towards the close of Friday’s session, giving up some of its gains and wrapped up for the week at ₹368.5. Comparing this with ₹367.3 — the previous week closing price — there is essentially not much change. Hence, it is reiterated that a close above ₹380 is a prerequisite for the stock to move to higher levels. Noticeably, both the relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator point upwards, indicating a build-up in positive sentiment. In such a case, the stock may appreciate to ₹395, beyond which it will face a hurdle at ₹400. But, if the stock is sold off from the current levels, it may decline to ₹350."
13,2019-09-22,ITC,"Future Perfect: Consider bull call spread on ITC 
The stock of ITC (₹238) is ruling at a crucial level. It finds an important support at ₹226, a close below which will trigger a fresh down-slide on the stock. An immediate resistance appears at ₹253; a close above that will change the immediate-term outlook positive. In that event, the stock could rally up to ₹275 or even to ₹296.
F&O Pointer: Despite the market surging on Friday, the stock of ITC closed almost on a flat note. It also witnessed a roll-over of 5 per cent to October series. Trading in option indicates a range of ₹230-250 for the stock.
Strategy: Traders could consider a calendar bull spread on ITC. This can be initiated by selling the current month ₹235-call and simultaneously buying the next month’s contract. As these closed with premiums of ₹7.10 and ₹11.05, respectively, traders have to shell out ₹9,480.
 










 
This will be the maximum loss one can suffer in this strategy, which will happen if ITC rises during this month and closes below at ₹235 the next month.
On the other hand, profit potentials are very high if ITC falls or stays at the current levels and moves up in the next month’s series vigorously. We advise traders to hold the position for at least three weeks.
Follow-up: As advised, hold SAIL position and close it on the expiry day."
12,2019-09-29,ITC,"Weekly trading guide










 
SBI opened the week strongly at ₹307.5 against the previous close of ₹301.7, up nearly 2 per cent. The stock appreciated further to a high of ₹316, briefly trading above the 50-day moving average. However, the stock reversed abruptly as it could not sustain the bullish momentum and the price began to decline, breaking below the key supports at ₹300 and ₹292.
Thus, the near-term outlook seems weak as rallies are sold-off. The relative strength index has dipped below the 50-mark, indicating weakness. On the downside, supports are at ₹273.7 and ₹267. Resistances are at ₹292 and ₹300. The next leg of trend can be expected only if the stock price breaks either to ₹300 or ₹267.
In case it goes above ₹300, the stock will face a hurdle at the resistance band between ₹305.1 and ₹307.6, beyond which it may potentially retest the ₹316 levels. But if the stock breaks below ₹267, the sell-off could intensify and the stock will most likely tumble to ₹260. The return last week was minus 6.2 per cent.










 
The stock price of ITC took a huge leap as it opened the week at ₹250 against the previous close of ₹238.05, which is a solid 5 per cent gain. It extended the rally and went on to make a high of ₹260.5. However, the stock could not move beyond that level and the price started to soften and slumped to ₹242.7, from where it bounced off from the 21-day moving average support.
Studying the chart, one can observe that the stock is consolidating sideways as the price oscillates in the band between ₹247 and the resistance band ₹258-260. If the stock manages to breach the upper limit of the range at ₹260, it is likely that it will appreciate towards ₹270 levels, beyond which there’s an immediate resistance at ₹273.
However, if the stock weakens and slides below the lower limit of the range, that is, ₹247, the price may depreciate to ₹240, below which it can even drop to ₹234 levels. Last week’s return was plus 6.5 per cent.










 
Infosys witnessed considerable selling immediately after the previous week opened. As a result, it tumbled below the key level at ₹800. A stronger rupee weighed down the stock. The fall extended to ₹741.9 before the stock recouped some if its losses, closing the week at ₹782.
Recoveries are strongly resisted by the price band between ₹793 and ₹800. Hence, the near-term outlook remains weak. It has also moved below the 50-day moving average, potentially shifting the medium-term trend to bearish. The RSI has dipped below the 50 midpoint and the moving average convergence divergence indicator too appears weak. So, if the scrip weakens below ₹781, it will most likely depreciate to ₹762.
A break below that level can intensify the bearish trend and the stock could dwindle to ₹725 levels. Alternatively, if the stock manages to post a recovery beyond the stiff resistance at ₹800, there will be a minor resistance at ₹814, beyond which it might move northwards to ₹850 levels over the medium term.










 
Following the bullish momentum, the stock price of Reliance Industries continued to gain throughout last week. The stock toppled the key resistance at ₹1,300, making the case stronger for further appreciation. The relative strength index is clearly favouring the bulls and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has come into the positive territory, denoting a strong prevailing uptrend.
Also, the stock price has broken above the falling trend-line resistance. The stock has posted gains for two consecutive weeks. All these imply that the stock is on a strong bull trend and is likely to continue appreciating in the coming sessions.
On the upside, the stock will face a minor resistance at ₹1,320, beyond which it could strengthen to ₹1,365 levels in the near term. On the other hand, if the stock undergoes a correction, ₹1,300 will act as a key immeidate support, below which the price could fall to ₹1,240 in the short term. The return last week was plus 4.4 per cent.










 
The share price of Tata Steel was consolidating last week, fluctuating between ₹360 and ₹380. Though the stock attempted to move past ₹380, it failed, as it was rejected by the 50-day moving average. Thus, the broader ₹345-380 range continues to control the trend.
The moving average convergence divergence indicator implies weakness and so is the relative strength index. But since the RSI remains in over-sold conditions, the chances of a major downtrend from the current levels stand reduced. But unless the stock invalidates the range, the direction of the next major trend will be indecisive. Hence, the near-term outlook seems sluggish.
If the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range, it may rise towards the resistance band between ₹395 and ₹400. Beyond those levels, it can move upwards to ₹440. But, if the stock breaches below ₹345, the support is at ₹330, below which the stock could test the psychological level of ₹300."

ITC has joined hands with the Andhra Pradesh Government to develop a chilli value chain.
The Agri Business Division of ITC and the Department of Horticulture have conceptualised an integrated Agri Extension Platform for chilli farmers under the public-private partnership model.
The chill farm development platform will benefit 40,000 farmers in Prakasam, Krishna, Guntur and Kurnool districts, with about 10,000 acres under the crop.
The objective is to improve the competitiveness of the chilli crop in terms of its productivity, quality, sustainability and price, so as to maximise value and ensure better returns for the farmer, through a set of physical and digital interventions to improve production.
Andhra Pradesh is one of the top producers of chilli in the country (close to 9,92,900 tonnes) and there is a big opportunity to make it a global sourcing centre for the finest safe chilli, says S. Sivakumar, Head, Agri & IT Business of ITC.
Despite the inherent strengths of the state, food safe chilli (that meets US and European standards) exports is approximately 17,500 tonnes, which accounts for only 1.8 per cent of the total production. Hence, there is a huge space to grow and make it the largest Food Safe Chilli Destination in the world market.
The proposed platform comprises four key components — deployment of Skilled Agri Extension Resources at each village, an eChoupal digital platform, a digital engagement centre (call centre) and a Chilli Pradarshan Kendra (CPK).
ITC has deployed skilled, digitally enabled agri extension staff in the project villages. The chilli farmers have been provided access to the e-Choupal 4.0 mobile app. They can also talk to industry experts through the call centre.
The CPKs are demonstration plots supported by the horticulture department, where the ITC team would showcase the latest research developments from universities, national institutes and technology partners for the benefit of the farmer.
ITC’s e-Choupal 4.0 digital + physical model will facilitate the delivery of real-time information and personalised knowledge to the farmers effectively, says Sanjiv Rangrass, Divisional Chief Executive, ITC Agri Business Division.
ITC has also identified and trained Rythu Prathinidhis or Champion Farmers in each project village to shares the knowledge they gain with fellow growers, to contribute to a sustainable future.
The Rythu Prathinidhis would also play a role in supporting their fellow farmers on the use of the e-Choupal 4.0 app."

SBI in a strong bear grip (₹249.9)
The stock posted some recovery in the month of September by appreciating to ₹315 levels. However, the rally did not sustain, and the stock fell sharply from that level. During the past week, the price even slumped below a critical support at ₹267 and closed at ₹249.9, indicating that the next leg of trend is on the downside. The stock has been continuously falling and has registered back-to-back weekly loss. The daily relative strength index is below the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has entered the negative territory, meaning there might be more selling pressure. An immediate support is at ₹246. Below that, the sell-off could intensify, potentially dragging the price to the support band between ₹230 and ₹233. On the upside, the stock will face resistance at ₹260. If the stock manages to get past that level, it might move towards ₹267. Considering the scenario, traders can sell the stock on rallies with a stop-loss above ₹267. The stock posted a weekly loss of 11 per cent.
 










 
ITC holds on to its gain (₹257.2)
There was not much volatility in the ITC stock last week. The stock briefly traded beyond the ₹247-260 range, but eventually moved back into the range after facing a hurdle at ₹263 — 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bear trend. The stock has closed in the green for the second week in a row, though the gain was marginal. It should also be noted that the stock continues to trade above both the 21- and 50-day moving averages, implying a bullish bias. The daily relative strength index is above the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence indicator looks steady in favour of the bulls. The stock seems to be trading with a bullish bias. However, the price might soften further before breaking on the upside. Hence, one can initiate long positions either at ₹250 levels or beyond ₹260 with a stop-loss below the lower boundary of the range at ₹247. Look for target between ₹270 and ₹273, which is a considerable resistance zone. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1.7 per cent.
 










 
Infosys moves in sideways range (₹793.4)
The price action of Infosys stock is sluggish and seems to be trading sideways. The stock attempted to break above the critical resistance at ₹800 but failed . Noticeably, the price has been oscillating between ₹781 and ₹800 for the past seven trading sessions. Also, it could not move past the dynamic 50-day moving average resistance which is currently coinciding with the resistance at ₹800, making it more significant. Unless the stock invalidates the sideways trend, the next leg of the trend will be unclear. The moving average convergence divergence indicator is showing signs of weakness, but the relative strength index seems to be recovering. However, only a breakout beyond ₹800 will take the stock price higher. If it gets past ₹800, it will face a minor resistance at ₹814. Above that, the price could rally towards ₹850 . Alternatively, if stock price dips below ₹781, it will decline further to ₹762. A break below ₹762 will intensify sell-off and the stock price could dwindle to ₹740 level. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1.4 per cent.
 










 
Reliance above key support (₹1,308.1)
The share price of Reliance Industries did not change much compared to the previous week and witnessed low volatility. The opening price and closing price were at the same level, meaning a doji candlestick in the weekly chart. It denotes a temporary indecisiveness on the direction of the trend during the past week. However, the bullish trend in the stock looks solid and as long as it trades above the key support at ₹1,300, the chances for price moving northwards is high. There is no weakness observed in the relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator seems to be steady. Hence, any correction in price can be used as an opportunity to initiate long positions. It is likely to move up to ₹1,365 and ₹1,400 levels, testing the life-time high of the stock. Stop-loss can be set below the immediate support at ₹1,300, because if the stock undergoes a correction, that level will perhaps arrest the decline. Below that level, subsequent support can be seen at ₹1,240.
 










 
Tata Steel poised to decline further (₹333.1)
Tata Steel witnessed selling pressure last week and the price broke below the lower boundary of the ₹345-380 range that had been holding the stock for the past three weeks. The break down opens the door for further weakness in the stock. It has pierced below the 21-day moving average as well. The daily relative strength index stays below the mid-point level of 50, where the moving average convergence divergence indicator is in the negative territory. All this could indicate that the stock might attract more selling pressure in upcoming trading sessions. Even though the stock currently hovers around a support at ₹330, traders with short-term and medium-term perspective can sell it on rallies. Below that level, the price will most probably depreciate to the psychological level of ₹300 in the short term. The support comes in at ₹280 levels. However, if the stock moves up from the current levels, rallies could be capped between ₹345 and ₹360. It posted a weekly loss of 7.3 per cent."

ITC Ltd, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries, and others from India Inc, have listed out their investment plans for Madhya Pradesh at the investor summit.
While ITC plans to set up a modern food processing centre at a total investment of Rs 700 crore, Sun Pharma is looking to expand its two manufacturing facilities in the states. Reliance Industries said it would double the number of petrol pumps and retail outlets in Madhya Pradesh, besides setting up 45 logistic centres in the State.
In his recorded video message, played during the Magnificent Madhya Pradesh Investors’ Summit here, Reliance’s Chairman Mukesh Ambani said the company has invested over Rs 20,000 crore in the State during the last few years. It has created large-scale employment and emerged the second largest employer after the State Government. It has developed coal bed methane plants in the state and built the first and only gas pipeline that connects it with the national gas grid. This has opened up multiple investment opportunities. He said Jio has become the greatest catalyst for transforming MP into a digital society. Today, MP alone consumes more data than South Korea, the UK, France, Germany or Canada.
Talking about the future, he said the company has over 600 stores and 100 petroleum retail outlets in the State. “We will have more than double these numbers in the coming years. The new commerce initiatives of Reliance Retail will benefit tens of thousands of kirana stores and small merchants,” he announced, while adding that the state is a natural choice for a logistics hub because of its strategic location.
“Reliance will be setting up national distribution centres in MP, with over 10 million sq ft of space across 45 locations,” he said. Further, Reliance will also explore investment opportunities in the renewable energy sector to promote sustainable development and the green economy.
Later, addressing the gathering, Sanjiv Puri, Chairman and Managing Director of ITC, announced the setting up of a new food processing plant in the State. “Land is with us. Design work is going on and we expect production to commence soon,” he said. Besides producing all the famous brands, including ‘Ashirwad’ and ‘Bingo,’ the plant would de-hydrate locally sourced vegetables, to be sent across the country.
The company sources a large quantity of wheat from Madhya Pradesh, which produces among the finest qualities of the crop, such as ‘Sarbati.’ The company is also working on enhancing the farmer’s realisation and will focus on strengthening the agriculture value chain and irrigation storage facilities. The company also aims to encourage horticulture in the state.
Sun Pharma’s Dilip Sanghvi said his company has so far invested over Rs 500 crore in the state. Though, Sun did not have its own manufacturing units in the State, post the takeover of Ranbaxy’s assets in the State, it has two manufacturing units, Dewas and Mallanpur. “We are looking to expand these facilities,” he said.
India Cement’s N. Srinivasan said work on new cement and grinding plants in the State is in progress . However, his only ‘complaint’ was that his company has not been able to keep up with the State Government’s pace in approvals and permission.
Eleven industry leaders, including Godrej’s Adi Godrej, Bharti’s Rakesh Bharti Mittal, CII chief Vikram Kirloskar, Trident Group’s Rajinder Gupta and others participated in the one-day event.."

After a subdued opening, the stock of SBI rallied in the end of last week and broke out of the range between ₹246 and ₹262. The price is testing the 21-day moving average which falls at around ₹270. The daily relative strength index indicates a bullish divergence and the moving average convergence divergence indicator, too, shows an uptick.
The short-term outlook of the stock is bullish, which could lead it higher to ₹275 level, a resistance that coincides with the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bear trend.
Above that level, the medium-term trend of the stock will turn bullish and attract more buyers, which could lift the price to ₹290 in the coming sessions.
Above that ₹300 — a psychological level — is the next hurdle. On the other hand, if stock cannot hold on to the bullish momentum and the price corrects, the supports will be at ₹262 and ₹267. The stock posted a weekly gain of nearly 6 per cent.










The stock price of ITC traded sluggish the past week trading in a tight range between ₹243 and ₹247. After a significant fall in the preceding week, the stock could not post a recovery and was resisted strongly at ₹247. Since the major trend is bearish, the stock will have difficulty breaking out of that level.
The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator is flat and do not indicate any bias. The price of ₹247 is also coincides with the 50-day moving average, and the 21-day moving average lies at ₹249, making the price area between ₹247 and ₹249 a significant resistance zone.
Since the stock has formed a good base at ₹243, it is not recommended to approach the stock with a negative bias. If the price breaches either ₹243 or ₹249. A breakout will result in the stock moving towards ₹253, whereas a break-down will result in the stock declining to the previous low of ₹234. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1 per cent.










After breaking out of the range between ₹780 and ₹800 on the upside, Infosys opened the week significantly lower. But further decline in the price was arrested by a support at ₹760, coincided by the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous uptrend. Importantly, the 21-day moving average has gone below the 50-day moving average, suggesting the possibility of the medium-term trend becoming bearish.
A significant weakness is observed in the moving average convergence divergence indicator. One can also observe a head- and-shoulders pattern in the daily chart, which is an indication of trend reversal. A close below ₹760 on a daily basis will confirm the pattern and result in the stock tumbling to ₹673, as projected by the pattern. Noticeably, the stock has a support at ₹725.
On the other hand, if the stock takes support at ₹760 and moves up, it will face a hurdles at ₹780 and at ₹800. The stock posted a weekly loss of 5.8 per cent.










The stock of Reliance Industries had a muted start as it traded flat during the first half. In the latter half, the stock resumed its stellar rally and marked a new life-time high of ₹1,427.9 on Friday. With a close at ₹1,416.3, it has breached the ₹1,400 mark and could potentially trigger the next leg of uptrend in the coming days.
The daily relative strength index has entered the over-bought territory, but the price action looks steady. The moving average convergence divergence indicator suggests considerable upward momentum. The medium-term trend of the stock is strongly bullish, and it can be bought on dips. On the upside, the stock has the potential to climb to ₹1,485, beyond which it will face a resistance at ₹1,500.
However, if the stock is subject to a correction on the back of profit-booking, ₹1,400 will offer a strong support. On further correction, a less likely scenario, the stock will find support at ₹1,365. The stock posted a weekly gain of 4.7 per cent.










The stock price of Tata steel rose last week after taking support at ₹340 levels. However, it stopped short of breaking the resistance at ₹360. But the price has closed above the 21- and 50-day moving averages, thereby raising the possibility of further ascent.
The daily relative strength index has crossed the midpoint level of 50 and one can also spot a bullish divergence, making the case stronger for the bulls. The moving average convergence divergence is also showing an uptick.
The current closing level is a resistance, and if the stock manages to break out and appreciate as a result of buying interest, it could advance to ₹380 in the coming days, beyond which it will face a hindrance in the form of a resistance band between ₹395 and ₹400. Alternatively, if the stock obeys the resistance at ₹360 and declines, it will decline to ₹345, below which the support is at ₹330. The stock posted a weekly return of about 6 per cent."

The stock of SBI climbed throughout the past week, crossing an important level of ₹300; it even registered a 13-week high of ₹317.8 on Thursday. Noticeably, it has moved past ₹309, the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. After closing at ₹313.5, the stock is currently trading at a resistance in the band between ₹309 and ₹315. But the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator continue to indicate a bullish bias and the medium-term outlook of the stock is positive. So, with the current momentum, the stock will most likely break out of ₹315 and move up towards ₹335. Note that before ₹335, the stock could face a minor resistance at ₹324, the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. A daily close above ₹315 will confirm a higher peak, which could reinforce the existing bullish momentum. On the other hand, if the stock undergoes a correction on profit-booking, it has supports at ₹300 and ₹292. The stock has returned an impressive 15.3 per cent for October.
 










 
The stock of ITC gained during the past week after facing a sell-off in the week before. The stock currently faces strong resistance at ₹263 – also substantiated by the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend. Though the daily chart shows that attempts to break ₹263 for the past three trading sessions have failed, the 21-day moving average has crossed over the 50-day moving average, indicating a shift in the medium-term trend. Also, bullishness is exhibited by the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator. So, on the back of it, if the stock closes above ₹263 on daily basis, it will confirm a higher peak and will attract fresh buying interest, lifting the stock price further. On the upside, it will face resistances at ₹269 and ₹274. On the contrary, if the stock faces selling pressure, it will find immediate support at ₹258. But a break below that level could drag the stock to ₹250 over the medium term. Despite high volatility, the stock closed flat in October.
 










The Infosys stock was impacted by negative news and the price tumbled by a record level and even registered an 11-month low of ₹615.1. The 21-DMA has crossed below the 50-DMA; the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are pointing downwards making the medium-term outlook weak. However, the stock price recovered over the past week and managed to close at ₹687.9, above the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of ₹638. But only a break above ₹700 can lead to a sustainable recovery. Over the medium term, it is highly probable that the stock will consolidate within a broad range of between ₹620 and ₹700. In case the sentiment shifts in favour of the stock resulting in the breakout of ₹700, it will face hindrances at ₹745 and ₹760. Alternatively, if the price breaches the support at ₹620, it will test the 52-week low at ₹599.8. Below that level, the sell-off could accelerate, potentially pulling down the price to ₹575. The stock plunged 14.9 per cent in October.
 










Reliance Industries (RIL) continued its uptrend, hitting record high in the past week. The stock registered a new all-time high of ₹1,489.65 on Thursday and closed with significant gains for the third consecutive month. Though the bulls appear to be in control, there are some concerns which can be observed in the price action. The bearish divergence is visible in the weekly relative strength index (RSI), whereas the daily RSI is hovering in the over-bought territory after seven months. The moving average convergence divergence indicator also shows a bearish divergence in the weekly time-frame. These factors call for caution as the stock might witness a price correction. So, if the stock declines, ₹1,400 will act as a support. A break below that level could drag the stock to ₹1,360. But if the stock continues with the current bullish trend, it is highly likely that it will appreciate to ₹1,500. The stock gave a return of 10 per cent October.










 
A recovery in the stock price of Tata Steel accelerated last week as it cracked above a key resistance at ₹380 and closed at ₹399.8, testing the psychological level of ₹400. But the price has already confirmed a higher peak and the 21-day moving average is attempting to cross over the 50-day moving average – a bullish signal. The stock has also moved past the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous swing at ₹395, paving the way for further appreciation. The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are signalling a substantial bullish momentum. Importantly, the price action has developed a double bottom chart pattern on the daily chart, which already stands confirmed. The stock will face a resistance at ₹418, beyond which it has the potential to move towards ₹440. However, if the price level of ₹400 manages to hinder the gains, it could decline to the supports at ₹380 and ₹360. The stock gained 5.5 per cent in October."

After seeing a flat opening last week, the SBI stock broke out of the range between ₹315 and ₹324. It made an intra-week low of ₹299.7, but bounced up from that level as ₹300 is a strong support. However, the upward movement was capped by a resistance at ₹324 and the stock closed the week at ₹321.9, moving back into the range. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend is at ₹324, making the level a significant one. But the bounce-back looks strong and will most likely lift the price above ₹324 in the coming days. The 21-day moving average continues to remain above the 50-day moving average, maintaining the near-term outlook on the upside. The daily relative strength index, after a blip, is showing an uptick, but the moving average convergence divergence indicator has started to show weakness. If the stock continues to move up, breaking out of ₹324, it can possibly rise to ₹335 in the coming days. However, if the resistance holds and the stock declines, it can be expected to decline to ₹300.










The stock of ITC fell throughout last week and closed with a loss, consecutive in the last five trading sessions. Since the major trend is on the downside, the bears seem to have quickly gained traction on the reversal, negating the breakout of ₹263 in the previous week. At ₹250 level, the stock is hovering around the 50-day moving average. This level coincides with the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bull trend and can thus act as a good support. But the daily relative strength index has dipped below the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has slipped into the negative territory. Both conditions are considered as indicators of bearishness, and the stock will most likely fall in the coming days. On the downside, the stock might find support between ₹247 and ₹250. A break below that level can pull down the price to ₹242 levels. Alternatively, if the stock appreciates from the current level, it will face hurdles at ₹258 and ₹263. The stock declined by 3.8 per cent last week.










The recovery in Infosys stock looks to have taken a pause as it appears to have entered a consolidation phase. The price has been oscillating between ₹690 and ₹725 for the past two weeks. Until the stock continues to trade above ₹690, it is highly likely that it will resume the uptrend in coming days. However, a prolonged sideways movement can be risky, leading to a decline. The daily relative strength index, like the price action, seems to have become flat, whereas the moving average convergence divergence indicator is still in the positive region, indicating strength. In a scenario where the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range at ₹725, it will most likely appreciate to ₹760. This is a critical level as the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bear trend coincides with the 50-day moving average. Beyond that level, the stock has the potential to advance to ₹800 over the medium term. However, if it starts to move southwards and breaches the lower boundary of the range at ₹690, it could depreciate to ₹665, below which the support is at ₹620.










The stock of Reliance Industries gained in the latter part of last week after gradually declining during the week prior. This hints that the bullish trend might have resumed after the minor correction. On pullback, the price marked an intra-week low of ₹1,422.5, coinciding with the 21-day moving average. It then bounced from that level and ended the week at ₹1,470.8, retaining the bullish outlook. But looking at the oscillators, we can observe some weakness in the stock. The daily relative strength index is showing a down-tick following a bearish divergence; also, the moving average convergence divergence indicator has moved into the negative territory. Both indicators hint a potential trend-reversal. On the back of these factors, if the stock declines from the current level, it will find support at ₹1,430. A close below that level would result in a fresh low, taking the price to ₹1,400. However, if the stock gains bullish momentum and continues to advance, it will retest the lifetime high at ₹1,489.65. Resistance above that level is at ₹1,528.










The stock of Tata Steel was sluggish last week, and is hovering around the support at ₹395. Since it has extended the consolidation from the previous week, the recovery in the stock seems to be losing steam. The support at ₹380, coincided by the 21-day moving average, holds the key for the medium-term trend. So, as long as it trades above that level, the stock will have a bullish bias. But a break below that level could shift the trend to bearish. Since the overall trend is on the downside, this might result in a sharp depreciation. The daily relative strength index along with the moving average convergence divergence is showing a downward bias as it entered the negative territory. So, if the price weakens from the current level, the stock might slip towards the support at ₹380 in the near term, below which the support is at ₹360. On the other hand, if the stock starts moving on the upside, it will immediately face a resistance at ₹400. Above that level, the hurdle lies at ₹418 — the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend."

4,2019-12-11,ITC,"ITC expanding frozen foods offering, targeting busy millennials
FMCG major ITC, is aggressively ramping up its frozen snacks range targeting retail stores as well as the food services segment. The company, which has been test-marketing these products since mid-last year, aims to grab a 15-20 per cent share of the frozen snacks market in the country over the next three years. 
Overall the frozen snacks range launched under the brand, ITC Master Chef, consists of nearly 50 products such as achari beetroot kebab, rajmah ki galauti, chicken galauti and mumbai vada pops among others. While the entire range is available through the food service channel in 60 cities, about 17 products have now been rolled-out in retail stores in metros and other tier-1 cities, as part of the fullscale commercial launch of the range. 
Sachid Madan, Chief Executive -Frozen Snacks, Fruits & Vegetables, ITC Ltd said, “The penetration of frozen snacks in the Indian market is just about 5 per cent. Our endeavour is to grow the penetration of the category by making it widely available to consumers through the retail channels as well as in restaurants, cafes and pubs through the food services segment.”
Frozen food market is currently pegged at about ₹7,500 crore and grew at 17 per cent CAGR in 2018 with multiple organised and unorganised players. 
While the size of the retail segment of frozen foods is estimated to be about ₹1,400 crore, over ₹2,400 crore comes from the food services segment. Exports contributed about ₹3,600 crore. 
“Globally, frozen food is growing at a massive pace eating into the share of other categories but in India it is just about 2.5 per cent of the total packaged food industry. We believe with evolving consumption patterns of time-pressed consumers there is a huge untapped potential for growth of ready-to-eat frozen snacks for in-home and out-of-home consumption occassions,” he added. 
The company is focussing aggressively on corporate sampling and in-store sampling to make consumers familiar with the product. It is also putting in significant resources behind deploying ITC Master Chef-branded freezers as well as upgrading horizontal freezers to vertical freezers at retail stores.
“ There are a lot of myths about frozen foods and we want to change the perception of Indian consumers about this category. Our product range has been carefully developed using advanced technology to preserve the goodness of ingredients and offer healthier and preservative-free options to home makers as well as professional chefs,” he added. 
It said it will add one new product every month focussing on regional favourites as well as other innovative products leveraging on its agri-sourcing capabilities and cold chain."
3,2019-12-15,ITC,"Weekly trading guide: ITC rebounds from a crucial support 
The uptrend in the SBI stock since the beginning of October witnessed a correction after it registered a four-month high of ₹351 in late November. The correction resulted in the price dropping to ₹308, where the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the prior bull trend lies. The stock took that level as a support and bounced sharply the past week. Also, the daily relative strength index is showing an uptick, and it has crossed above the midpoint level of 50. Thus, the bull trend seems to have resumed and the outlook is positive for the script. However, one needs to be watchful of the resistance in the band between ₹332 and ₹335. From a trading perspective, rather than creating fresh long positions at the current level, one can buy the stock after it closes above ₹335 on a daily basis or if it moderates to ₹325. The initial stop-loss can be placed at ₹315; start shifting it upward with a gap of 1.5 times the ATR (average true range) as the stock advances. The key resistances on the upside are at ₹350 and ₹362.










The stock of ITC has been on a decline since the beginning of November. The decline was stopped at the support of ₹235. This level has been acting as a strong support since August. The stock recovered and ended the week at ₹241.6, forming a reversal candlestick pattern, ie, a hammer in the weekly chart. However, the stock at the current level is facing a stiff resistance at ₹243. This level also coincides with the 23.6 Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend, making the resistance more significant. Hence, for the stock to perform a sustainable rally, the price should close above ₹243 on a daily basis. So, from the perspective of trading, one can approach the stock in two ways. One, initiate fresh long positions if the stock closes above ₹243 and place the stop-loss at ₹238. Two, buy the stock if it falls to ₹235 as that level is a strong support and the risk-reward ratio is highly favourable for long positions; place the stop-loss at ₹230. The potential short-term targets on the upside are at ₹247.5 and ₹252.










 The stock of Infosys continues to trade along the sideways trend. Since the beginning of November, the stock has been held between two key levels at ₹690 and ₹725. As the consolidation phase has been in place for quite some time, the oscillators, ie, the moving average convergence divergence and the relative strength index in the daily chart, are unable to hint any direction. Moreover, the 21- and the 50-day moving averages have converged to the same price level due to lack of trend. Hence, the next leg of the trend can be confirmed only if the stock gets out of this range; traders are advised to stay on the fence until then. If the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range at ₹725, the rally will lead the price towards ₹760. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bear trend coincides with this level, making it a considerable resistance. Any further appreciation will take the stock to ₹800. On the other hand, if the stock breaks below the lower boundary of the range, it could decline to ₹665. Below that level, the support is at ₹620.










 The recent uptrend in the stock of RIL, that began in August, seems to have taken a pause. The price has been consolidating for the past three weeks. However, there are certain indications that the stock might witness a downward movement. The daily relative strength index has formed a bearish divergence, a negative indication; the moving average convergence divergence indicator also exhibits a negative bias. But by observing the price action, we can find that the stock has formed a strong base at ₹1,534, and as long as the price stays above this level, the script can be approached with a bullish inclination. Also, the stock remains above the 21-day moving average, maintaining the short- term positive outlook. Hence, from a trading perspective, one can buy the stock when it retests ₹1,534, and place the stop-loss at ₹1,525. The near-term target can be at ₹1,610. If the stock breaks out the 52-week high at ₹1,614.45, it might appreciate to ₹1,665. Strictly adhere to the stop-loss as a break below ₹1,534 could reverse the trend to bearish.










 The recent bull trend in the stock faced a hurdle, and it pulled back twice in the past one month. But the stock managed to restrict the declines, forming higher lows at ₹383.1 and ₹389. Last week, the stock went up and closed at ₹428.4. It also closed above the 21-day moving average, corroborating the bullish bias. The daily relative strength index is showing an uptick and so is the moving average convergence divergence indicator. All these factors indicate a positive momentum being built up in the stock. However, it faces a resistance at ₹434, where the previous rally was capped. Hence, this is an important level, and a close above it will be necessary to carry over the momentum. Given the scenario, traders are recommended not to initiate fresh short positions as the stock is in a bullish momentum. Wait for the stock to decisively breach ₹434, and initiate long positions with a stop-loss at ₹405 with the potential target at ₹460. As the stock advances, move the stop-loss with a span of 1.5 times the ATR (average true range)."
2,2019-12-15,ITC,"Value-added agri products to be new growth drivers for ITC
 Diversified conglomerate ITC Ltd expects good growth in its value-added agri-products business. Demand is seen rising across both consumer categories and food service categories and the company plans to expand its portfolio.
The company currently offers fruit pulp, tomato puree, ‘IPM Chilli’ and ‘IQF Prawns’ under its basic value-added products; while those like high curcumin, turmeric, blended spices, low sugar potato and organic pulp are offered under the attribute-based value-added category.
An attribute based offering refers to a product which focuses on a specific quality of the food item having low sugar or low glycemic index, and so on.
According to S Sivakumar, Group Head, Agri and IT Businesses, ITC, growth in terms of absolute number will be higher in case of the consumer business. But, the rate of growth is faster in the food services segment.
“Obviously, there will be more in the pipeline(and) there is plenty of space (in the value added segment). (We could add more products) as consumers tell us what they want and as we see more trends,” he told BusinessLine.
Value-added products offer the triple benefits of meeting the emerging demands of consumers, especially with regard to food safety and social consciousness; raising farmers’ incomes; and offer new drivers of growth for ITC. ITC Master Chef Super Safe Frozen Prawns, Super Safe Spices, Farmland brand of fresh fruits and vegetables with differentiated product functionalities, organic and fair-trade certified fruit pulps are some offerings.
Sivakumar said region specific flavours could be added too. Some offerings are in the product development stage; or they are undergoing various levels of R&D to make them ‘shelf-stable’ and ‘taste stable’.
“At this time our focus is on market development of these products among domestic consumers and also the food service ones. As these categories expand, they become larger in the portfolio of our businesses,” he said.
According to Sivakumar, there’s a rising demand for differentiated needs where customers prefer one variety over another. For instance, a food service like a bakery houses may require a particular wheat type over another. In such cases, ITC prefer attribute-based selling.
For instance, in potatoes differentiated offerings like low sugar or high antioxidant ones are in demand apart from the ‘regular ones’ like table and processed varieties.
“Value-added agri products are emerging categories that are small in demand. But, they are riding on the early part of the trend of safety and social consciousness. Therefore, as that wave expands it becomes potentially a much larger business opportunity for ITC,” he pointed out.
A large part of the ‘value’ in these value-added offerings comes from the farms, that include how the crop is grown. “One has to work with farmers closely and also increase farmer capacity significantly unlike producing normal commodities,” he said."
1,2019-12-22,ITC,"Weekly Trading Guide: Infosys breaks out of the range
The resumption of the bull trend looks evident as SBI closed the week above the resistance band between ₹332 and ₹335. The stock began the week on the back foot, slipping to the support level of ₹325. This support also coincides with the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bull trend. The stock took support at this level and began to rally. The bullish stance is corroborated by key oscillators. The relative strength index in the daily chart shows a fresh uptick following the rally in price. 
 










 
Also, the moving average convergence divergence indicator is on the verge of entering the positive territory. Thus, traders can continue to take a bullish view and initiate long positions on corrections. The initial stop-loss can be placed at ₹320 and subsequently revised upwards by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock moves upward. The immediate resistance is currently at ₹351 currently — its previous high. The subsequent resistance is at ₹362.
The prevailing bear trend, which has been in place since the beginning of November, appears to be limiting the upside in the stock. The stock of ITC gave up its entire intra-week gains. In the past week, after breaking out of the resistance at ₹243, the stock faced resistance at ₹247.5, and started to decline from that level. This level coincides with the 38.2 Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend, making it a significant resistance. 
 










 
However, fresh short positions are not recommended at the current levels even though the stock is trading with a bearish bias, as the risk-reward ratio is not favourable. Importantly, the moving average convergence divergence indicator in the daily chart shows signs of recovery as it has moved into the positive region. Moreover, the price level of ₹235 is a strong support. Hence, unless the stock breaks either ₹235 or ₹247.5, the trend will be unclear. Until then, traders can adopt a range- trading strategy. The resistance above ₹247.5 is at ₹252; the support below ₹235 is at ₹228.
After consolidating since the beginning of November, the stock of Infosys moved out of the range between ₹690 and ₹725. It rallied past the upper boundary of the range at ₹725 and closed the week at 731.5, confirming the breakout. Thus, the medium- term outlook for the stock has become bullish. Adding to the positive bias, the daily relative strength index has formed a new high, following the breakout. Also, the moving average convergence divergence in the daily chart is exhibiting bullish bias. 
 








 
 
The 21- and 50-DMAs are currently at the same level, ie, ₹710, and the stock is trading well above that level — another positive indication. From the perspective of trading, one can initiate fresh long positions on dips with a dynamic stop-loss. While the initial stop- loss can be placed at ₹700, move it upwards by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock advances. The primary target can be at the resistance level of ₹760 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. On further appreciation, the stock can rise to ₹800.
The stock of Reliance Industries (RIL), which has been in an uptrend since August, has been consolidating within a range for the past month. But recently, it bounced from the 21-day moving average and registered a fresh lifetime high of ₹1,617.55. Thus, the bull trend seems to be gaining traction after the pause. But it should be noted that, despite making new highs, the relative strength index (RSI) and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are showing a lack of momentum. In fact, we can spot a bearish divergence in the RSI, hinting at the possibility of a trend- reversal. 
 








 
 
However, the stock has a solid base at ₹1,534, and unless the price breaks below it, the trend-reversal cannot be confirmed. Also, the 21-day moving average is acting as a reasonable support. So, traders can be cautiously bullish and buy the stock on declines. Place a trailing stop-loss at ₹1,550 and raise it by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock appreciates. The short-term targets are at ₹1,665 and ₹1,700.
Extending the bull run, the stock of Tata Steel surged last week. It breached a crucial resistance at ₹434. Thus, it has formed a new peak in the daily chart, denoting a good upward momentum. Substantiating the bullish bias, the moving average convergence divergence indicator in the daily chart continues to advance, implying considerable strength in the uptrend. 
 
 








 
 
However, while the bull trend is backed by several factors, it may not be favourable to buy the stock at the current levels as ₹460 is a crucial resistance. Also, the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level is at ₹470. So, the price band between ₹460 and ₹470 might act as a resistance band, where the stock can witness some profit- booking. From a trading perspective, it can be approached in two ways. Either initiate fresh long positions on a close above ₹470 with the stop-loss at ₹445 or buy the stock if the price moderates to ₹440 with the stop- loss at ₹425. The potential targets on the upside are at ₹495 and ₹515."
0,﻿2019-12-23,ITC,"Consider a bull calendar spread on ITC 
The outlook for ITC (₹241) remains negative. The stock finds crucial support at ₹236 and the major one at ₹192. ITC finds immediate resistance at ₹256 and the major one at ₹305. A close above latter will change outlook positive for the stock. After underperforming for quite some time, we feel the chance of ITC turning resilient is very high.
F&O pointers: ITC futures saw a rollover of about 49 per cent to January series. The ITC January futures also commands a premium, signalling long rollovers
Option trading indicates a range of ₹235 to ₹250 for the stock.
Strategy: Traders could consider a calendar bull strategy using 240-strike. Traders should sell 240 call of the current month and simultaneously buy the January series. They closed with a premium of ₹3.45 and ₹8.75. So, this will cost traders ₹12,720 to initiate the strategy. Market lot for ITC contracts is 2400 shares.
The maximum loss would be the premium paid, and that will happen if ITC fails to cross ₹245.30 by January.
Profit potentials are high if ITC stays below ₹240 during the current series and rises sharply in January month.
Hold the position at least three weeks.
Follow up: Hold Axis Bank position as advised."
