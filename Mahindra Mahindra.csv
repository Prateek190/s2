95,2018-02-19,Mahindra Mahindra,"M&M to raise monthly EV production to 4,000 units by next year
Mahindra & Mahindra is planning to increase its electric vehicles (EVs) production to 4,000 units a month by December 2019.
 The company has a capacity of about 400 EVs a month, said Managing Director of the company Pawan Goenka on Monday. 
He was interacting with the media persons on the sidelines of the summit. 
Goenka said that 4,000 EVs target would be scaled up to 5,000 EVs a month. The company already has invested about ₹600 crore on EVs in the last six years. 
Recently it has also announced its plans for investing ₹400 crore in Karnataka and ₹500 crore in Maharashtra over the next five years. 
It is a leap of faith, as today the demand for three and four wheeler EVs is 200 to 300 units a month. But M&M is taking that leap with a much higher capacity.
On the recent statement made by NITI Aayog CEO, Amitabh Kant about the country not requiring an EVs policy, Goenka said that the company was not waiting for any policy for implementing its plans. 
“To be a pioneer, you cannot wait for the road to be laid with a six-lane highway. You have to create your own road and make it happen,” he said. 
He pointed that the statement made by Kant about India not needing an EVs policy is over-analysed. 
The statement should be taken positively as already a lot of developments are going on in the EVs space. India is not going back on its commitment to EVs.
Every week State governments are announcing their EVs policies, recently Maharashtra announced its policy, which is one of the most aggressive ones, these are not signs of diminishing interest in EVs.
He said that the current level of subsidies are needed for the EVs to be price competitive and the infrastructure required for charging needs to come up a lot more rapidly. 
If these happen then in 2022, there will be a consumption of two lakh EVs vehicles in the country.
Goenka said that the cells for the EVs will not be made by M&M, but all other components would be made by the company. 
Making of cells, require much larger scale to justify those costs. All other parts and components will be made by M&M locally in the next two years."

HSBC says India's tractor industry has grown “strongly” in the past two years and it expects a continued growth of 10-12 per cent in FY19 as well.




HSBC says India's tractor industry has grown “strongly” in the past two years and it expects a continued growth of 10-12 per cent in FY19 as well.


 HSBC has raised the price target of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd to Rs 840 from Rs 795, and it has maintained “buy” rating.
HSBC says India's tractor industry has grown “strongly” in the past two years and it expects a continued growth of 10-12 per cent in FY19 as well.
With Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka due for elections this year, nearly 30 per cent of total tractor market can see higher spending this year, it adds.
Mahindra & Mahindra reported a better-than-expected Q3 profit earlier this month, with domestic tractor sales rising over 6 per cent. “Normal north-east monsoons and good reservoir levels helped in boosting the rural sentiment and demand for tractors,"" the company had said.
Up to Wednesday’s close, the stock had risen 8 per cent in 12 months versus 12 per cent gain in the Nifty Auto index. Thirty eight out of 42 brokerages covering the stock rate it ""buy” or higher and four “hold""; their median price target is Rs 880."
93,2018-02-23,Mahindra Mahindra,"Tractor industry on course to register highest-ever domestic sales in FY-18
Encouraged by the continuing momentum in sales, the tractor industry hopes to end the current fiscal with highest-ever domestic volumes close to 6.8 lakh units.
The industry’s previous highest domestic number was in 2013-14 when domestic sales stood at 6.34 lakh units.
Tractor companies and industry analysts project a growth rate of 17-18 per cent for the current fiscal. During the last fiscal, the industry registered domestic sales of 5.8 lakh units.
Tractor makers have said that while the industry’s Q3 performance was better than expected, the sales momentum continued in January, and hence, they expect Q4 to be equally good. Leading players such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Escorts and Sonalika Tractors reported more than 40 per cent growth in their January domestic volumes.
During the first 10-month period of this fiscal, the domestic tractor volumes are reported to have grown by about 18 per cent. During this period, Mahindra and Escorts reported a growth of 18 per cent and 17.5 per cent, respectively.
“In Q3, the tractor industry has performed better than what we had expected. When we started the quarter, we were thinking that it will be flat to may be just marginally positive. But, the industry ended with 8 per cent growth. This is obviously on the basis of very good production of kharif crop, positive sentiment in rural area and government’s thrust in agricultural and rural segments,” according to Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, Mahindra & Mahindra.
“January has seen a 38 per cent increase (domestic and export) and the industry growth will be between 15 per cent and 18 per cent in Q4. This year we expect the industry to end with highest-ever volume,” he said.
Escorts expects domestic tractor volumes to touch 6.80 lakh units in the current fiscal.
T Karthikeyan, Senior Analyst – Corporates, India Ratings & Research, said domestic tractor sales grew by 17 per cent at 6.59 lakh units during April 2017-January 2018 and the growth was on account of two consecutive years of normal-to-good monsoons, improved crop production, easy availability of credit to farmers and increasing use of tractors in non-agricultural sectors.
Rating agency Crisil has projected that the tractor industry will achieve domestic sales of 6.5 lakh units in FY-18 and attributed the volume boom to the prospects of a successive normal monsoon, declining interest rates and farm loan waivers by States."
92,2018-03-09,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra unit moves to cut truck ownership cost
Mahindra & Mahindra’s Truck & Bus Division on Friday announced several new initiatives to reduce the total cost of ownership of its trucks and buses. 
These initiatives include a six-year/six lakh km warranty on Mahindra Blazo. The company said it has also increased oil change intervals leading to significant saving of 9 per cent per annum for transporters.

90,2018-03-22,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra reaffirms faith in e-mobility despite policy detour 


Mahesh Babu, CEO, Mahindra Electric




Mahesh Babu, CEO, Mahindra Electric


There are no two ways about the fact that Mahindra & Mahindra has been at the forefront of electric mobility even if its overall sales numbers don’t quite reflect this intent.
Since the time it acquired the Bengaluru-based operations of Reva in 2010 to kick off the journey, M&M has pulled out all stops to grow its electric vehicle (EV) business. During this time, the e2O Plus hatchback has become its best known mascot even while other models such as the Verito sedan as well as some of its small cargo carriers now have electric options.
If the big break in numbers has still been elusive, it is largely to do with the absence of fiscal sops across the country and, more importantly, charging infrastructure. In a country where affordability is still an issue, never mind all the brouhaha about the affluent middle-class, electric vehicles like the e2O Plus would hardly qualify as an entry-level option for the first-time car buyer.
Things seemed to be looking up when the Centre made known its intent to go all out with its e-mobility drive and announced its intent to have a 100 per cent electric ecosystem in place by 2030. It was clear that this was going to be a tall order even while some manufacturers hurriedly made known their plans to abide by this directive.
This was where Mahindra Electric would have rightly assumed that it had a headstart over the rest thanks to years of hard work in this direction. And even while the Centre subsequently shelved its EV policy, the company had already made up its mind to set up another unit in Chakan near Pune.
Eyeing global market
It was barely 10 days ago when Mahesh Babu, CEO, Mahindra Electric, made an elaborate presentation at Mahindra Research Valley (MRV) in Chennai along with his counterparts in other businesses. It was here that he spoke of the vision to ramp-up production at Chakan and Bengaluru from 12,000 to 70,000 units in the next three years.
“This is conditional on the demand for the different types of vehicles,” elaborates Babu in an email response to BusinessLine. While kits for three-wheelers and light vehicles are planned in Bengaluru, Chakan will be home to heavy-vehicle kits.
“The 70,000-unit capacity between the two facilities is forecasted to be split evenly, based on current volume projections,” he adds. From the company’s point of view, the strategy going forward will be twofold: EV drive train technology and EV products. “At Mahindra Electric, we will be producing the drive train kits that will power the vehicles made by M&M and SsangYong,” says Babu. “We are already following a similar model with the Supro and Verito platforms being electrified by LV (light vehicle) kits.”
The new products slated to be electrified were announced under the company’s EV 2.0 strategy and include two high performance vehicles — an SUV and a sedan — in addition to the eKUV. “The eCosmo bus was showcased at the Auto Expo earlier this year and other variants will be launched shortly,” says Babu.
The company is already producing the complete vehicle for the e2O Plus. In addition, the Treo electric three-wheeler will be produced in Bengaluru. Clearly, there is a well defined roadmap for the e-mobility business, which will balance business priorities between the two plants.
Incidentally, the EV Innovation centre was inaugurated in 2017 and is based in Bengaluru. “With the utilisation and volume of projects we are currently undertaking, we foresee a need for a more elaborate state-of-the-art R&D and test facilities, which will also be based in Bengaluru,” reveals Babu. This new facility will be part of the ₹900 crore investment in EV technology.
Beyond India, Mahindra Electric’s offerings are also present in Nepal and Sri Lanka. In 2014, this writer was invited by the company to be part of the e2O launch in Bhutan, the neighbouring hill kingdom, which is keen on pushing for clean air mobility alternatives.
In addition, Mahindra Electric will be supplying the EV powertrain SsangYong, which it acquired in 2011. This may end up being the big breakthrough in global markets where the Korean auto brand is well established. Likewise, there is every possibility of another exciting chapter happening in EVs with Ford where the partners are still discussing the contours of their alliance.
Nagpur fiasco
Yet, not everything is hunky-dory going by recent media reports on the Nagpur e-mobility drive with Ola, which has apparently ended up being a damp squib with drivers disgruntled with the state of affairs.
When asked if the company has been discouraged by the Ola experiment in Nagpur, Babu responds that from a product perspective, the company’s cars have run more than two million kilometres with “positive feedback from the drivers and customers who have used the vehicles”.
It is also his view that the EV ecosystem needs some “initial learnings and adoption that we believe was faster and quicker in case of Nagpur”. His response indicates that the experiment is not quite as disastrous as the reports have made it out to be.
“We are confident that the electric vehicle ecosystem will evolve soon with the initiatives already taken by all stakeholders and the learnings from the pilots,” reiterates Babu.
The other reality to be factored in is the Centre’s decision to keep its EV policy on hold after all the initial bluster. Is there really a reason then for Mahindra Electric (and other auto-makers) to go flat out, especially when infrastructure constraints, in the form of charging stations, still remain?
A bold vision
“We invested in EVs back in 2010 because we believe in the need for sustainable mobility,” replies Babu. As he reminds you, the Centre had expressed a “bold vision” to go all electric by 2030 and the EV policy was part of that initiative.
“We believe that the NITI Aayog report on Transformative Mobility Solutions for All sets a clear direction on what India needs to do in the mobility space,” continues Babu. Based on the report, action plans have already been made by various ministries to support e-mobility.
This, of course, includes the release of the world’s largest EV tender for 10,000 vehicles by EESL (where Tata Motors also participated in the exercise along with Mahindra Electric) and the Power Ministry’s intervention to declare charging services exempt from the restriction on resale of electricity.
It, of course, remains to be seen if this EESL order will now be history with the scrapping of the EV policy.
Babu, clearly, does not share this pessimistic outlook. He points out that the company has already completed the delivery of 150 vehicles as part of the Phase I requirements and has now bid for Phase II. Further, a new tender for an additional 10,000 vehicles was announced earlier this month.
”With these developments, it is clear that the intention and action to adopt EVs in government departments is running strong,” he says. “There are indications that the FAME scheme will be extended again past March 31, which was expected and is towards a positive direction.”"
91,2018-03-22,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra Group, FordMotor to jointly develop SUVs, e-vehicle
Mahindra Group and Ford Motor Company have decided to jointly develop new SUVs, and a small electric vehicle as part of their partnership that has been formalised with multiple pacts.
The two companies signed five new memoranda of understanding (MoUs) to strengthen their strategic alliance and accelerate the development of vehicles for India and emerging markets. 
“Today’s announcement is the next step in the collaboration between Mahindra and Ford,” said Dr Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.
The MoUs, which are non-binding, mark the progress made by the two companies since announcing their alliance in September 2017, according to a statement.
Both will leverage their strengths in the utility vehicle space to co-develop a mid-size sports utility vehicle (C-SUV).
Built on the Mahindra platform, the new SUV will drive engineering and commercial efficiencies and will be sold independently by both companies as separate brands.
Mahindra and Ford agreed to evaluate co-development of a compact SUV and electric vehicle, along with sharing powertrain portfolios, including the supply of Mahindra powertrains to extend Ford’s product range.
Key focus areas
They also announced plans to co-develop a suite of connected car solutions for consumers.
“Ford is committed to offering the best vehicles, technologies and services that fit the lifestyles and preferences of Indian consumers. With utility vehicles and electrification as key focus areas, we are glad to see the progress our two companies have made,” said Jim Farley, Ford Executive Vice-President and President of Global Markets.
Global reach
The strategic alliance between the two companies continues to focus on leveraging the benefits of Ford’s global reach and expertise and Mahindra’s scale in India and its successful operating model.
Teams from both companies will continue to work together, for a period of up to three years, to develop further avenues of strategic co-operation and that will include extension of support for Mahindra in global emerging markets, including Ford’s manufacturing and distribution network as also to address future mobility needs."

As Facebook’s data breach issue rocks the countries, Mahindra group Chairman Anand Mahindra has asked Indian start-ups to work on a native social media. In a Tweet on Tuesday, he offered to provide seed fund if any start-up comes forward to work on such a project.
“Beginning to wonder if it’s time to consider having our own social networking company that is very widely owned, professionally managed and willingly regulated. Any relevant Indian start-ups out there? If any young teams have such plans, I’d like to see if I can assist with seed capital,” he said in the Tweet.
What followed is a flood of comments with project ideas in various stages of development and suggestions on how an indigenous social network should look like. This post went viral with over 1,600 people re-tweeting it by the evening.
“Look forward to work with you and selected teams to build a next gen #social3.0 network, out of India,” Jaspreet Bindra, a start-up advisor who has been asked to receive the ideas, said.
He felt that using Blockchain in a social network would make it secure from breaches.
“I have developed a social networking platform that not only provides to share content but also makes advertising and sales a lot more accessible to the general audience,” a fledgling entrepreneur said."
88,2018-04-05,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra to sell Trakstar tractors in six more States
Mahindra & Mahindra plans to launch its Trakstar range of tractors in six more States as part of its Phase II growth plans.
The company introduced its new range of tractors under Trakstar, the third tractor brand of Mahindra, across Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and West Bengal in September 2017. The new brand comes from Gromax Agri Equipment, a subsidiary of Mahindra.
“The tractors have been well-received and the feedback from dealers and customers has been positive. We are expanding the sales to more States that will include Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Assam,” Harish Chavan, Chief of International Operations, Farm Equipment Sector, M&M, told BusinessLine.
“We are targeting farmers looking for affordable mechanisation solutions. The Trakstar range will be present across 30-50HP category. The company also has enhanced its portfolio with the Trakmate range of implements which includes cultivators and rotavators,” he added.
M&M is seeing an increase in market share in the 30-50HP category since launch and it hopes to maintain the momentum with network expansion in the coming months.
“We plan to increase the footprint of Trakstar tractors and Trakmate implements in focussed States through new retail points and expanding dealer network,” he said.
Industry analysts point out that with the product range covering 80 per cent of the market, it would help M&M garner 3-4 per cent market share, with gains coming from the lower end non-premium segment.
“Cannibalisation from Trakstar would be limited, as there would be no Mahindra branding. Also, the target segment is the price-conscious buyer, who wouldn’t have considered the Mahindra or Swaraj brands in the first place,” a report of financial services company Prabhudas Lilladher said."

 The Mahindra Group announced two partnerships for its foray into new areas in the Defence business – one with Israeli company Aeronautics for naval shipborne UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) and the other with Japan-based ShinMaywa Industries Ltd for naval seaplanes.
Aeronautics and Mahindra plans to supply UAV system that can be launched and recovered from Indian warships.
“It’s our first foray into UAVs (popularly called as drones). Aeronautics is a leading manufacturer of UAVs and its products are sold in nearly 55 countries,” SP Shukla, Group President, Aerospace & Defence Sector, Mahindra Group and Chairman, Mahindra Defence, told BusinessLine.
“It’s our first venture in India. We were looking for this kind of partnership and discussed with many other companies. But we found an ideal partner in Mahindra,” said Amos Mathan, CEO, Aeronautics.
Together, they will be bid for the projects that are expected to come from the Indian Navy.
“The partnership covers all aspects of ‘Make in India’ programme that includes transfer of technology, indigenisation and assembly of products in India,” he said.
But other things such as investment, assembly unit, structure of the partnership will be decided after the tenders floated by the Navy.
Explaining USPs of the UAVs, Shukla said Israeli firm’s products offered the most-advanced technologies and UAVs can land even in a small ship. “It has sensors and cameras which are absolutely cutting edge and they light in weight,” he added.
Seaplane partnership 
Mahindra Group and ShinMaywa Industries Ltd of Japan have decided to join together to supply US-2 amphibian aircraft (seaplane) for the Indian Navy.
US-2, manufactured by ShinMaywa Industries, is a modern heavy amphibious aircraft. It has the state of art equipment, lake landing capability, long endurance and extended radius of operations with large payload capacity. It can operate in very rough sea operations.
India and Japan are now discussing the methodology of procurement of Amphibian Aircraft US-2 requirements of the Indian Navy. 
“Our understanding covers an exclusive partnership between the two organisations. Depending on the size which Navy chooses to buy, we will be in a position to indigenise at different levels. Larger the number, more indigenisation can be done. MRO and pilot training have to be done in India notwithstanding the number of planes. We already have pilot training for two major OEMs in India. Navy will have to decide its requirements. But we are ready to serve the country with our products which are ideally suited for their requirements,” said Shukla."

 American aerospace giant Boeing announced its tie-up with Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd and Mahindra Defence Systems to manufacture F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets in India.
The announcement comes at a time when the Indian Air Force is looking to procure 110 fighters jets under a $15-billion deal and the Indian Navy is in advanced stages to purchase 57 multi-role carrier borne fighters (MRCBF) for around $12 billion.
“Boeing is excited to team up with India’s only company that manufactures combat fighters, HAL, and India’s only company that manufactures small commercial airplanes, Mahindra. This partnership brings the best of Indian public and private enterprises together in partnership with the world’s largest aerospace company, Boeing, to accelerate a contemporary 21st century ecosystem for aerospace & defence manufacturing in India,” said Pratyush Kumar, President, Boeing India, said here. Boeing had been in talks with HAL and Mahindra for more than a year now for the F/A-18 Super Hornet project. Its partnership with HAL, which already has the competency to build warplanes, is expected to drastically bring down the cost of each F/A-18, which might not be a positive news for the Russians who are looking to offer the advanced MiG-35 at a lower cost compared to others.
“Our partnership with HAL and Mahindra will enable us to optimise the full potential of India’s public and private sector to deliver next-generation F/A-18 fighter capabilities. Together we can deliver an affordable, combat-proven fighter platform for India, while adding growth momentum to the Indian aerospace ecosystem with manufacturing, skill development, innovation and engineering and job creation,” Kumar added.
‘Make in India’ drive
Boeing also said the Super Hornet ‘Make in India’ proposal is to build an entirely new production facility that can be utilised for other programmes such as India’s Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft.
T Suvarna Raju, Chairman and Managing Director, HAL said the partnership with “will create an opportunity to develop capabilities of the aerospace industry and strengthen indigenous platforms in India thereby contributing to the Make-in-India activities.”
Boeing also said the future production with Indian partners will involve maximising indigenous content and producing the F/A-18 in India for its armed forces to create a 21st century aerospace ecosystem.
Future production with Indian partners will involve maximising indigenous content and producing the F/A-18 in India for its armed forces to create a 21st century aerospace ecosystem, the company said in a statement.

85,2018-04-12,Mahindra Mahindra,"M&M gears up for another competitive year


Rajan Wadhera




Rajan Wadhera


Rajan Wadhera is reasonably confident that the growth momentum is back within his company’s SUV ecosystem to keep it going strong through 2018-2019.
As President of Mahindra & Mahindra’s Automotive Sector, he knows that the three new products to be launched during this period are critical in keeping the story intact. These are the S201 compact SUV, U321 multipurpose vehicle and the Y400 premium SUV.
He admits that the competitive pressures on the company’s SUV business cannot be wished away, with a host of new models like the Vitara Brezza, Jeep Compass, Tata Hexa/Nexon and Hyundai Creta going the extra mile to woo customers. 
Robust sales
Wadhera then looks back at the fiscal gone by to drive home the point that the building blocks are firmly in place. He refers to the good showing of the Bolero, which grew by 23 per cent to nearly 86,000 units in 2017-2018. 
“We are back with very good penetration in the rural areas. We worked very hard to increase reach and consequently we have our growth to show,” he says.
Likewise, the Scorpio saw an upgrade of the entire fuel-injection system with a 140 hp variant and six-speed gearbox. Clearly, this has worked with customers and the model, first launched over 15 years ago, saw its highest ever domestic sales at nearly 54,000 units.
With the TUV 300 and XUV 500 accounting for another 55,000 units, the year was promising from the viewpoint of a company now getting back on track with its core SUV business. Of course, the KUV 100 and Xylo have had little to show in comparison, but all in all, Wadhera believes that things are firmly in place.
As the company now readies for its new launches, the focus is on strengthening the front end, which involves building dealer capabilities and getting closer to the customer. “Bolero numbers are good because of the rural thrust and focus that we have enhanced,” reiterates Wadhera.
Product development cycle
As he explains, in product development, a company needs to reach a critical volume and market share phase beyond which the cycles of product development help out. “However, we were not ready with the new products in as many numbers as we should have been because there is a cycle. Any new product takes three years to come,” he continues.
During that time, till there is no product to offer, others are going to get the numbers. Hopefully, the new launches this fiscal will help the cause. “They were all there three years ago in the pipeline. You cannot suddenly bring a product in a year’s time, it's impossible,” reasons Wadhera. Equally, this boils down to costing economics because launching a new model every year is big money. A company will need to assure itself of good volumes over a period of time to ensure that investments are recovered. “So at a point like that, you look for markets outside or at alliances which can take a part of your investment,” he explains. 
Similarly, borrowing platforms can halve costs as in the case of the new S201 platform coming from the Tivoli. “So obviously, we have not spent the full money. Any new top-body programme, as we call it, is half the cost of the original,” he says.
The other new launch on the SsangYong platform is the Y400, the high-end vehicle that will be a replacement for the Rexton. “Our investment is hardly anything, really speaking,” says Wadhera.
This becomes especially important in an era of stiff competition where volumes are not so easy to come by. The solution then is to look for synergies and acquiring or consolidating platforms rather than developing new ones. It also puts in perspective the importance of SsangYong, which M&M had acquired in 2011, as an ally.
Common platforms
“Moving forward, you would see in our three new SUVs that we have been very frugal either by acquiring or carrying over platforms,” elaborates Wadhera. In the process, the company has not spent the kind of money as it would have on a ground-up new platform development. “So that’s what gives us the financial leverage to get into the market,” he adds. From M&M’s point of view, the reality is that it is up against some global giants which have vehicle platforms that are not just designed for India but for a host of other markets. “They can subsidise and take a beating in India if the pressure is high. They need not take a beating in Brazil, Europe, Mexico, China etc,” says Wadhera. 
In its turn, M&M believes it needs to strategically look at these kinds of alliances, platform sharing or finding markets as big as India. “In the last year, our strategy is to do more local CKD assembly and we have already started that in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka with plans to include other regions,” he says.
Wadhera has no illusions about the fact that the road ahead will see more competition, what with new players like Kia Motors getting set to throw their hats into the ring. Yet, it is his view that the Mahindra brand still has a ‘fun-to-drive’ quotient along with the ‘tough and rugged’ imagery. 
The big job on hand is to increase the customer base, both in terms of numbers as well as the diversity in age. For instance, the TUV customer is about 25 years-old and a lot younger than other M&M brand users. 
“Our new S201 customers will be the real technology geeks and in the 30+ age group. At the moment I don’t have too many because I don’t have a product for them,” says Wadhera. It’s also here that a product like the Thar can be positioned as some kind of a cult brand to appeal to a certain buyer."

M&M's market capitalisation jumped to Rs 1,01,829.91 crore from Rs 99,604.59 crore yesterday.


 Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd has joined the coveted Rs 1 lakh crore market capitalisation club, after its share price hit a fresh 52-week high on the BSE on normal monsoon forecast.
India Meteorological Department has forecast that the monsoon this year will be normal, with rainfall of 97 per cent of the long period average (LPA) with an error of plus or five per cent.
If the forecast comes true, it will augur well for the country’s economy, as it will be the third successive normal monsoon year. The country had recorded a rainfall of 97 per cent in 2016 and 98 per cent last year during the season, which runs from June to September.
After opening on a bullish note at Rs 815, M&M stock gained further ground and touched its all-time high level of Rs 819.10, up 2.23 per cent over its previous closing price.
Following the uptick in the counter, the company’s market capitalisation (m-cap) jumped to Rs 1,01,829.91 crore, higher by Rs 2,225.32 crore, from Rs 99,604.59 crore yesterday. 
Similarly on the NSE, the stock opened at Rs 816, then jumped 2.16 per cent to Rs 818.80, its 52-week high level.
Expectation of normal monsoon and a shift in government spending towards rural areas bodes well, Goldman Sachs said in a note, maintaining its FY19 real GDP growth forecast at 7.6 per cent.
Another normal monsoon and the government's focus on rural development implies that rural income levels could rise faster in FY19, CLSA said in a note, adding one of the key beneficiaries of this would be Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd .
Following the jump in its m-cap, M&M has joined the ranks of Ultra Tech Cement, Power Grid Corporation, and IndusInd Bank.

Following the jump in its m-cap, M&M has become the 29th company to join the lakh crore or trillion market-cap club.
According to BSE, TCS is at the top with ₹6.06 lakh crore market-cap, followed by Reliance Industries (₹5.978 lakh crore), HDFC Bank (₹5.05 lakh crore), ITC (₹3.267 lakh crore) and HDFC (₹3.129 lakh crore).
While according to the NSE, the stock was listed on January 3, 1996, BSE says the listing happened before 1991.
Kotak Securities analysts, after meeting the company management in March, said: The management outlined its automotive business strategy and shared details on its new launch pipeline, plans on electric vehicles, and in-house R&D capabilities. The company showcased its extensive R&D efforts towards developing new BS-VI compliant gasoline engine range and achieving significant reduction in cost of BS-VI compliant diesel vehicles compared to earlier expectations, which was quite impressive. “M&M remains our preferred pick in the sector given attractive valuations and reasonable growth prospects and our target price stays at ₹945.”
 








 
Titan glitters
Meanwhile, Titan Company is at striking distance to replace Tata Motors as the second-most-valued-company in terms of market capitalisation among the about two dozen listed Tata group companies.
At the end of Tuesday’s trading, Titan’s market-cap stood at ₹88,632 crore, against Tata Motors’ ₹97,274.78 crore.
Titan Company, which was earlier known as Titan Industries, commenced operations in 1984 under the name Titan Watches, a joint venture between the Tata Group and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation. However, in 1994, Titan diversified into jewellery.
According to its 2017 annual report, jewellery business is the maximum revenue generating entity under the Titan umbrella now, thanks to its Tanishq brand. The total revenue of the jewellery business jumped 17.4 per cent in FY17 to ₹10,237 crore over FY16, whereas revenue from watches and accessories stood at ₹2,028 crore.
Delivering value
Titan’s stock has delivered immense value to investors over the last several years, and its ability to compound earnings at 23 per cent a year over the past 10 years has been a key enabler in this regard, said JM Financial Services in a recent research report and added: “We believe 20 per cent revenue CAGR over FY18-23E should also support margin expansion that should ideally lead to an even higher rate of growth in profit over the same period (operating leverage), which would help sustain the stock’s premium valuation.”"

Its revenue and other income rose by 24 per cent to Rs 13,355 crore during the fourth quarter of 2017-18, compared to Rs 10,795 crore in the year-ago period, M&M said in a regulatory filing.

Mahindra & Mahindra has reported a net profit of ₹1,155 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 50 per cent from the year-ago period, helped by big boost in tractor sales coupled with the company's cost-cutting measures.
The automaker’s consolidated revenues grew 25.6 per cent year-on-year to ₹13,189 crore driven by the farm equipment segment.
Operating margins expanded to 15.1 per cent in the quarter from 11.2 per cent in the comparable quarter last year.
“This has been our best quarter ever,"" said Pawan Goenka, Managing Director. “Our auto sector grew by 20 per cent —highest in 21 quarters, tractors grew at 40 per cent — highest in 31 quarters and we also had best margins ever in tractors.""
Goenka, however, added that oil price rise, firming up of commodity prices and liquidity crunch and capacity constraints with suppliers could be potential challenges for the company this year.
He said M&M expects 8-10 per cent growth this year in its tractor sales and 10-12 per cent growth in commercial vehicles sales.

77,2018-05-31,Mahindra Mahindra,"Tata Motors shares underperform four-wheeler peers 
Tata Motors’ shares have underperformed its four-wheeler peers namely Maruti Suzuki and M&M over the last decade. While Tata Motors’ market capitalisation has grown around four times, those of Maruti and M&M grew 12 and 7 times, respectively as on May 30, according to data provided by Capitaline.
The market capitalisation of Maruti Suzuki is now almost triple that of Tata Motors (in 2008, Tata Motors was ahead of Maruti Suzuki by ₹382 crore). The valuation gap between Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki has exploded because of superior financial performance by the latter, thanks to a boom in the domestic passenger vehicles market, Maruti’s continued market leadership and successful launches.
Compounded annual growth rate in sales and adjusted net profit of Maruti have seen it outperform Tata Motors on three-, five-, and 10-year basis (ending FY17) .
In FY18, Maruti’s topline growth of 17 per cent exceeded Tata Motors’ 9 per cent, but profit growth of 5 per cent was lesser than that of Tata Motors.
The gap between Tata Motors and M&M was 1.5 times in 2008 but the latter was able to bridge the gap and surpassed Tata Motors on April 25 this year.
In FY18, M&M’s performance was better than Tata Motors, with the former registering sales and adjusted net profit growth of 10 per cent and 59 per cent, compared to 9 per cent and 15 per cent by the latter.
Eicher comes closer
Not only four-wheelers, but the market capitalisation of two-wheeler major Eicher Motors (best-performing automobile stock) too, is now close to Tata Motors.
The gap in market capitalisation has reduced dramatically — from 25 times to 1.1 times in a decade.
This is because Eicher Motors has exhibited stupendous jump in profitability consistently in the last decade (ending FY17) — best among automobile companies — though topline growth has underperformed Tata Motors.
Based on average target prices estimated by analysts, the Tata Motors stock provides the highest upside potential of 37 per cent among the four stocks mentioned above, only because of its huge past underperformance and lowest FY20 price-to-earnings multiple of around 10 times.
Otherwise, the outlook on business is worrisome. “Undemanding valuation post steep correction makes the risk-reward favourable in our view. Near-term demand outlook for JLR remains challenging due to weakness in key markets of the UK, Europe and the US. For standalone business though, outlook is strong, helped by strong macro and likely improvement in market share trends,” said Jefferies on Tata Motors.
M&M, analysts’ favourite
Analysts unanimously vote for M&M due to reasonable valuation amid good fundamentals. Analysts expect 13 per cent rise in its stock price. There are mixed views on Eicher Motors, which is trading at 25-30 times FY20 estimated earnings. According to analysts’ target price, there is a potential for gains of 16-18 per cent in Maruti and Eicher. “We continue to like Maruti’s unique moats, though valuation (23x FY20E versuss five- and 10-year median at 17/20x) leaves little upside,” said HDFC Securities, which has a neutral rating. Elara Capital recommends to accumulate the Maruti Suzuki stock."

As part of the World Environment Day celebrations, the Maharashtra government on Thursday signed MoUs with Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors to promote electric vehicles in the State. 
In the two MoUs, the Maharashtra government said it will work closely with various fleet partners, taxi aggregators, logistics companies, amongst others, to deploy 1,000 electric cars over the next one year.
Under the aegis of the first MoU, M&M said it will make efforts to become fully electric-ready by further investing in its Chakan plant for manufacture of EVs, e-motor, controller, battery pack and other electric vehicle components for multiple mobility applications related to battery pack assembly of EVs. As part of this expansion plan, the company will invest an additional ₹500 crore.
Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, said: “Now, we are investing further in next generation EV technology solutions and are actively engaging with the ecosystem stakeholders, both private and public to drive faster adoption of electric vehicles. The government of Maharashtra recognises this fact, and we are delighted to make the State a key partner in our growth over the coming years.”
The first deployment of EVs, as part of the MoU with M&M, will see 25 Mahindra e2oPlus vehicles ported on the Zoomcar platform in Mumbai. 
The MoU between Tata Motors and the Maharashtra government was on similar lines but also included setting up of charging infrastructure in the State. “As part of our tender with EESL, we have already completed the production of 250 cars and initiated the execution of phase 2 orders. Today’s delivery of 5 Tigor EVs by EESL to the Maharashtra government has effectively paved way for connecting our aspirations in the e-mobility space with the government’s vision. 
“With Tigor EV, we have begun our journey in boosting e-mobility and will offer a full range of electric vehicles to the Indian customers. We continue to work in a collaborative manner to facilitate faster adoption of electric vehicles and to build a sustainable future for India,” said Guenter Butschek, CEO & MD, Tata Motors.
The announcements, however, will not result into any new projects for either of the companies as the deployment of these EVs will be a part of a contract signed by both Tata Motors and M&M with state-run Energy Efficiency Services (EESL). 
EESL will buy cars from the two automakers, who are currently the only ones in the country to sell electric cars, and then lease out these e-cars to several States including Maharashtra. 
Last year, EESL had floated a global tender for 10,000 e-vehicles where Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra had emerged as successful bidders. 
The first 500 cars have been supplied in the first phase of the tender, while the second phase has been put on hold till there is a clarity on the policy on charging stations as specification of charging stations will determine specification for the e-vehicle tender. 
More States to go electric
EESL has signed up an agreement with Maharashtra for lease out of e-vehicles and installing the EV charging stations at the government offices as the State is envisioning generating investment worth ₹25,000 crore in EV and component manufacturing, assembly enterprises and charging equipment manufacturing under its new Electrical Vehicle and Related Infrastructure Policy - 2018 announced on Thursday in Mumbai.
According to EESL Managing Director Saurabh Kumar, the company is in discussions with several States, including Andra Pradesh, Gujarat, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh for supplying electric vehicles (EV).
Andhra Pradesh has signed an agreement to procure 10,000 EVs. Maharashtra has committed 1,000 cars in the first phase and Gujarat has opted for 7,000 cars, he added. 
So far, EESL has supplied around 200 e-vehicles in Delhi NCR, more 150 cars to be added, while the first batch of 100 cars went to Andhra Pradesh."

 Products from the Mahindra group are now designed to cater to the whole ‘universe of customers’, breaking down the ‘artificial divide’ of urban and rural buyers, M&M Chairman Anand Mahindra said.
 Aspirations of the people residing in rural areas are identical to those in urban centres, spurred by the rapid increase in technology and communications, Mahindra told PTI. “For a long time we have been saying that there is a divide between rural and urban India. We for some time in the Mahindra group have been seeing that as an artificial divide,” Mahindra said.
 The diversified group, with presence in multiple sectors, now designs its products keeping in mind varied nature of customers, he said. “In our businesses we design our products now for universe of customers. We believe that rural people should not be looked down, they have the same purchasing power and their aspirations are the same,” he added.
 Mahindra further said, “We do not see any divide anymore. We think whatever we provide for urban customers we ought to provide the same to the rural customer as well.” 
A leader in in utility vehicles segment, Mahindra has products like Bolero and Maxx which are more popular in semi-urban and rural areas as compared to new models like XUV500, KUV100 and TUV 300 that are in demand both in big cities and small towns.

Strategy: Traders can consider a bull-call spread on M&M. This can be initiated by selling ₹960-call (₹8.95) and simultaneously buying the ₹920-call (₹22.75). That means, traders need to shell out ₹13,800 for the strategy, as the market lot is 1,000 shares.

 Mahindra & Mahindra on Tuesday revealed that the name of its upcoming multi-purpose vehicle is Marazzo, which was previously codenamed U321. Derived from Basque, a sub-language of Spanish, the word ‘Marazzo’ means shark and is linked to the vehicle’s shark-inspired design. 
The new MPV, which will be positioned above Xylo, in an estimated price range of ₹10-12 lakh, will be launched in September and is expected to provide the company the much needed volumes from the passenger vehicle segment. 
Niche product
“Marazzo will get us volumes and help us close some product gaps that we had so far. It will be a premium product and we expect to create a new niche with this,” Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, M&M, told BusinessLine. Marazzo, which was built through a collaboration between Mahindra North America Technical Centre (MNATC) and Mahindra Research Valley (MRV) in Chennai, will initially be launched in a diesel only version, while the petrol variants will follow in the later months. 
The MPV will be the first from the M&M stable to have all-aluminium suspension, reducing the weight of the car significantly and thus improving mileage. The company said the new car will offer a new level of refinement and engineering. Marazzo comes with a patented architecture, for a unique balance of smooth ride, agile handling, space and quiet cabin. 
Rajan Wadhera, President Automotive Sector, M&M said, “The intense process of development and refinement of the Marazzo is comparable to any global vehicle and incorporates a number of innovations. This has delivered better space, smoother ride with a quieter cabin, best-in-class cooling, excellent safety and a tough body construction in the Marazzo.
“In fact, the Marazzo has the largest footprint (wheelbase x front track) of any Mahindra vehicle. I am confident that it will set a new benchmark and become a game-changer in its segment.”"

   -  PAUL NORONHA


The first part of the story is out but there is still a lot more to come.
Earlier this week, Mahindra & Mahindra announced that its next big offering, codenamed U321, had been christened Marazzo. The launch of this multipurpose vehicle is still some months away, which means details on its pricing, investments, anticipated volumes and so on will be known only then.
Pawan Goenka has reasons to be extra pleased with the new Mahindra baby as it is the first joint creation of the teams in the US and India. “This is the first tangible outcome since the time of setting up Mahindra North American Technical Centre (MNATC) in Detroit and that is what makes the Marazzo different,” says the Managing Director of M&M. 
Coordinated effort
The product was being conceived at the same time around 2014 and it made sense to leverage the talent in Detroit and rope them into the project. This literally meant that the first lot of six to eight people at MNATC were roped in to hand-hold their counterparts in Mahindra Research Valley (MRV) in Chennai.
“In India, we only have expertise up to a certain level while Detroit is full of people who have done automotive engineering all their lives,” says Goenka. The bigger challenge was to get people from MNATC and MRV to work together for the project. After all, there were a series of challenges to overcome on time zones, cultures as well as the basic engineering language.
“Fortunately, Americans like to begin work early while Indians prefer to work late,” smiles Goenka. This solved the time difference since video conferences could happen more comfortably during late hours in India, which was still the first half of the day in Detroit. 
The bonding between the teams gradually grew as they focussed on the project. Of course, there were the occasional arguments and disagreements but, by and large, the camaraderie was in place. More importantly, there were significant contributions from both sides. 
“If we had left everything to Detroit, we probably would not have got the overall package for the Marazzo. Likewise, if it had been left completely to MRV, the same would have happened. It was a joint effort by the end of the day,” reiterates Goenka. 
Striking a balance
While India contributed a lion’s share in sourcing, tooling and design, Detroit took over the engineering responsibility. It was also here that Rajan Wadhera, President of M&M’s Automotive Sector, played a big role in balancing things and “not letting go too far go either way”. By the end of the day, the customer in India is looking for a global product at an Indian price and this is where he helped provide the right balance.
Today, the teams from MRV and MNATC are already onto the next product, which is testimony to the spirit of cooperation that made the Marazzo a reality. “There was a lot of learning on the way and we have now established a good process by which we are able to combine the two sets of people and get the best out of their competencies,” says Goenka.
It is also his firm belief that the Mahindra group has also held its own over the years successfully thanks to its frugal approach to everything right from product development and investment to the way money is spent on offices, travel, etc. 
“The good thing is that these people at MNATC, who come from large MNCs, have adapted to our culture of frugality. The discipline and their engineering excellence they bring into our ecosystem is wonderful,’ says Goenka. 
This puts in context what he has constantly told the engineers at MNATC: ‘You are not here for us to change you; you are here for you to change us.’ Goenka also believes that the people who joined the Mahindra family in Detroit perhaps share the same mindset in frugal engineering.
This explains why working on the Marazzo was a unique experience for them. “If I were to speak for them, the joy of doing a product like this, with its investment and material costs, was perhaps as much as doing any product with large budgets and lesser constraints on material costs,” reasons Goenka. 
Looking back at the Marazzo’s journey, he does not cease to marvel at the kind of talent that MNATC has been able to attract. Over the last four-five years, it has evolved to Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA) with over 200 engineers on board.
Goenka believes that perhaps one of its biggest USPs is that it is akin to a startup organisation where a few people make key decisions, call the shots and move ahead without anyone constantly monitoring them. 
“I think this is what has attracted people to MANA and you will be amazed to see the kind of experience and expertise these people bring to the table. I must give full credit to our CEO, Rick Haas, who is very well connected and has got in the right talent to work with us,” he says.
Targeting the US market
It was Haas who also set the ball rolling in taking the Mahindra Thar for specific off-road use in the US. “Thar is a product that MANA people thought US customers would comfortably associate with,” adds Goenka. This paved the way for the Roxor, which is doing quite well.
It is here that MANA will have its work cut out in contributing to M&M’s development through collaboration with products like 321. Equally, the next priority would be to develop Mahindra as a brand in the US and this is where Roxor is the first part of that effort. “I never jump up and down too quickly and would rather wait for sustained success instead of one initial breakthrough. Roxor is a good start and perhaps we could look at something else too,” says Goenka. 
Whilst on the Marazzo, the contribution of Pininfarna cannot be ignored. The Mahindra-owned Italian car design firm pulled out all the stops in creativity along with its counterparts in Mumbai. The inspiration for the vehicle’s design was the shark and its sleek form, which in turned spawned the Marazzo style quotient in a host of areas ranging from the grille to tail lamp and interiors."
67,2018-08-07,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra Q1 net rides up 67% at Rs 1,257 cr on higher sales
 Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) today posted a 67 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 1,257 crore for the quarter ended June 30, driven by robust sales across segments. The company had reported a net profit of Rs 752 crore for the same period of the previous year (2017-18). 
Revenues and other income stood at Rs 13,551 crore for the first quarter as compared with Rs 11,006 crore in the year-ago period. The total domestic automotive volume of the company grew 16.2 per cent. Heavy commercial vehicle volume grew 123.4 per cent, resulting in a market share of 5.7 per cent, the Mumbai-based company said.
M&M exported 9,360 vehicles during the first quarter, a growth of 100.2 per cent over the corresponding period a year ago. Its domestic tractor sales grew 18.8 per cent and the farm equipment segment’s revenue crossed the Rs 5,000-crore mark during the period under review.
On the future outlook, the company said a normal monsoon with a satisfactory temporal and spatial distribution, combined with the recently approved higher MSP for kharif crops, should help support rural consumption further. 
“The global growth backdrop has remained buoyant so far. However, the recently announced and anticipated tariff hike by the US and retaliatory measures by trading partners have increased the likelihood of escalating and sustained trade actions. These could pose risks to global recovery and investments,” the company noted. 
Shares of M&M were trading 0.32 per cent up at Rs 936 per scrip on the BSE."
66,2018-08-07,Mahindra Mahindra,"Fiat-Chrysler’s US complaint on design, without merit: Mahindra
Fiat-Chrysler’s complaint against Mahindra & Mahindra in the US has no merit, said Anand Mahindra, Chairman, M&M group pointing to existing agreements with FCA. 
Responding to shareholder concerns over a complaint filed by FCA in the US, “M&M didn’t go there (US market) without looking into all possible issues that we might or might not face. We are very confident that this case is without merit,” Anand Mahindra said. 
Fight over Roxor design 
Last week, FCA had filed a complaint in the US to prevent the sale of Mahindra’s Roxor there on the grounds that Mahindra had infringed the designs of its subsidiary, Jeep. The company said Mahindra Roxor is modelled after the original Willys Jeep. 
Anand Mahindra said the company has not yet received the complaint. “We have had agreements with Chrysler in the past. We have an existing agreement and we believe their case is without merit,” Mahindra said. 
On being asked about M&M’s low market share in the automotive sector, Mahindra said the company is focused more on profitability rather than market share. 
Focus on profit
“Market share goes up and down. As a company we are more determined to be profitable, so we focus first on financial efficiency, making money. If we decide that profit share is secondary, then believe me market share would be very easy to gain. Pricing also determines market share. We also would like to have a healthy combination of both. We have some new launches, we hope that we will regain some of our lost market share,” Mahindra said. 
He also said that the company has no plans of bringing its high-end luxury electric car to India, which is being built by its Italian subsidiary Pininfarina. 
“We want to create a new segment called sustainable luxury; earlier people bought high-performance cars — you can zoom around in those cars, 0-60 miles in 2 seconds, what are you doing for your footprint on the planet and on emissions? We believe you can now enjoy high-performance, speed, and that too sustainably. They will go into the segment below that next. India may not be the best market for that,” Mahindra said. 
When asked about the company’s plans to build cars instead of SUVs, Mahindra said the definition of an SUV is now very fluid and taunted the competition for selling “plastic” SUVs. 
“People are calling cars which don’t have chassis SUVs; a car without a chassis is not really an SUV. The whole definition of SUV has become plastic, it is just expanding. If you were to really look at the old-day SUVs, which are ladder frame, I dare say our share has not gone down,” Mahindra said. 
“The pie has expanded, the definition has expanded, there is a slight optical illusion about our losing share. The market definition has changed,” he said."

Mahindra & Mahindra posted a 67 per cent rise in net profit at ₹1,257 crore for the quarter ended June 30 compared with net profit of ₹752 crore for the same period of the previous year, riding on robust sales and cost cutting measures. 
M&M’s revenues, including other income for the quarter, stood at ₹13,551 crore (₹11,006 crore).
The total domestic automotive volume of the company grew 16.2 per cent. Heavy commercial vehicle volume grew 123.4 per cent, resulting in a market share of 5.7 per cent, the Mumbai-based company said.
Meeting challenges
“Last quarter we had cautioned against four possible derailers for our growth. First was the monsoon, which went well. Second was the hike in interest rates, which we anticipated to be within 50 basis points and therefore that’s nothing to be worried about. Third, growing commodity prices, which went up significantly but our cost reduction measures combined with slight price increases helped contain that. Lastly, the fuel price increase also did not have an impact on our Q1 results,” said Pawan Goenka, Managing Director at M&M.
M&M exported 9,360 vehicles during the first quarter, a growth of over 100 per cent over the corresponding period a year ago. Its domestic tractor sales grew 18.8 per cent and the farm equipment segment’s revenue crossed the ₹5,000-crore during the first quarter.
For Q1, the Indian automotive industry (excluding two wheelers) grew 28.4 percent with passenger vehicles growing by 19.9 percent and the commercial vehicle industry growing by 51.5 percent. The domestic tractor industry witnessed a growth of 23.4 percent.
“The demand for both automobiles and tractors was driven by positive sentiment in the economy (both urban and rural) due to a third consecutive year of a normal monsoon, sustained investment in road and infra projects and availability of affordable finance,” M&M said. 
Goenka pointed out that the sharp increase in automotive numbers are due to the low base effect caused by the impact of GST and transition to BS-IV norms last year. “In Q1 F2018 the industry volumes for passenger vehicles was on the lower side due to the slowdown in demand preceding the implementation of GST in July 2017 and commercial vehicle volumes being adversely impacted due to supply constraints arising from implementation of BS-IV norms,” the company said. 
US tariff hike
On the future outlook, the company said the recently announced and anticipated tariff hike by the US and retaliatory measures by trading partners have increased the likelihood of escalating and sustained trade actions. “These could pose risks to global recovery and investments,” the company noted.
For the farm sector the company predicted good growth given the normal monsoon. “A normal monsoon, with a satisfactory temporal and spatial distribution, combined with the recently approved higher MSP for kharif crops should help support rural consumption further,” the company said."
64,2018-08-23,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra and SsangYong need to grow beyond their home turf


Selling well The Tivoli has been a successful product for SsangYong




Selling well The Tivoli has been a successful product for SsangYong


Mahindra’s acquisition of Korea’s SsangYong Motor in 2011 was in some ways an aspiration to become a legitimate global auto-maker, especially in the passenger vehicle space. 
For its part, SsangYong hoped to recover from the struggles of the past under new ownership and achieve its own global status. SsangYong’s previous owner, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIC), made no new investment in product development after its takeover of the Korean auto-maker, while urging SsangYong to cut its workforce. 
In addition, SAIC transferred SsangYong’s technology and design to be used for its vehicles built in China. In response, SsangYong’s workers’ union struck work in 2006 and 2009 (with the latter resulting in street fights between workers and police outside the Pyeongtaek factory gate, and followed by arrests, lawsuits and firing of workers) to protest against job losses.
Workers also feared their company would be relegated to being a sub-contractor of SAIC. All told, SsangYong’s experience under the ownership of SAIC was not a pleasant one. 
In contrast, the relationship between Mahindra and SsangYong has been trouble-free for the past eight years. Mahindra’s ownership has provided stability with the belief that it is a stronger and more serious owner with SsangYong’s long-term interest in mind. 
Its policy of “controlling but not meddling” and entrusting local management with major business decisions has built a good relationship with workers. This is why SsangYong has not faced any workers’ strikes during its annual wage negotiations for the past eight years. This is an outstanding and exceptional achievement, compared to the militant unionism at Hyundai and Kia, for instance.
Behind the scenes, Mahindra and SsangYong have created synergies and reduced costs especially in components’ sourcing. Mahindra rightly recognised that SsangYong was paying too much for components being sourced from European suppliers due to its erstwhile relationship with Mercedes-Benz. Correcting this to procure components from Korean and Indian suppliers has thus rationalised production costs. 
Synergies in India
In India, a product of these synergies will be seen in the recently unveiled Mahindra-badged next-generation SsangYong Rexton Y400. Most likely to be named as the Mahindra XUV700, the new vehicle is due to arrive during the festival season. 
Likewise, the S201, derived from the Tivoli platform, is going to be an extremely critical product for the Indian SUV-maker, which has been facing the heat of competition lately. This vehicle has the potential to do good volumes pretty much on the lines of the Tivoli, which has done brisk business. 
Mahindra and SsangYong have also jointly developed four engines — the 1.6L gasoline engine, the 1.6L diesel engine, the 2.0L gasoline turbo engine and the 2.2L diesel engine. But more needs to be done. SsangYong urgently needs to develop engines to meet even more stringent tail-pipe emission regulations.
For example, all of its models except the Tivoli virtually operate on one engine — the 2.2L diesel engine — in advanced markets. And while it has developed gasoline turbo engines for the potential US market and to comply with the WLTP (the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure) emission standards, they may have arrived a bit late. 
Realising this disadvantage, Mahindra and SsangYong are jointly developing more small-sized turbo engines such as 1.5L gasoline turbo engines. In addition, a more pressing problem for SsangYong is that its exposure to alternative fuel models is nil. Worse, its future plan is still not very clear.
Given its lack of resources to do all of xEVs(BEV, HEV, PHEV and FCEV), SsangYong needs to focus on a select few options. The biggest bet amongst these is likely to be BEV although the company is a laggard on this front. Nevertheless, Mahindra’s expertise in BEV through Mahindra Electric is likely to benefit SsangYong in terms of joint product development.
SsangYong also faces additional risks. Its geographical presence is heavily skewed to the Korean market, with 70 per cent of production catering to the domestic market so far this year, compared to 30 per cent back in 2011. 
This is because exports to Russia, Brazil, China, Ukraine and Australia almost dried up in the last few years. As a result, SsangYong’s total exports halved, from 74,000 units in 2011 to 37,000 units last year.
Simultaneously, its sales in Korea grew exponentially, from 39,000 units in 2011 to 1,07,000 units in 2017, accounting for three-fourths of its global volume. The biggest driver of this volume came from the addition of the highly popular Tivoli in 2015. 
Importantly, SsangYong also needs to return to profitability since any new infusion of funds can only be justifiable in a positive balance sheet. It will, however, have to go international to achieve this. 
LMC Automotive anticipates the auto-maker to begin sales in the US and Canada around 2022, and further predicts the North American region to account for 12 per cent of SsangYong’s global volume by 2025 on the back of the Korando C and the Tivoli.
Mahindra too wants to enter the US market, but is yet again facing hurdles. Its plans to sell the Roxor off-road vehicle are being blocked by allegations of trademark infringement of the Jeep brand by Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles.
The auto-maker’s previous entry in the US market about a decade ago was also scuttled with lawsuits from dealers and its US distributor, Global Vehicles USA. It is yet unclear how these latest troubles for Mahindra in the US will be resolved, but it will certainly delay the start of Roxor’s sale at the very least.
To conclude, both Mahindra and SsangYong need to expand beyond their domestic markets to mitigate the risks of over-dependence on a single market. However, only time will tell if they succeed.

Responding to Fiat's patent violation suit in the US, Mahindra & Mahindra and its unit Mahindra Automotive North America have filed a public interest statement with the US trade commission and have begun proceedings in a Michigan court to enforce a design agreement that it had executed with Fiat in 2009.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles U.S. LLC has filed a patent violation complaint with the US International Trade Commission against the company. As per the complaint, certain design features of Mahindra’s off-road utility vehicle ROXOR infringed intellectual property rights of Fiat's Jeep design, Mahindra said in a statement. Mahindra has said the complaint was “without merit”.
Mahindra is also seeking an injunction against Fiat from proceeding with the complaint, it added.
Fiat had not made a monetary claim in the complaint but has sought a permanent restrain over Mahindra Automotive from importing any parts or components into the US that infringe upon its intellectual property rights, the statement from Mahindra said."

 Mahindra & Mahindra has filed a public interest statement against Fiat Chrysler in the US after the latter’s complaint alleged the M&M Roxor infringed upon a Willys Jeep design.
“The company and MANA (Mahindra Automotive North America) have commenced a proceeding in the Federal District Court at Michigan to enforce the Grill Design Agreement that the company had executed with Fiat in 2009 and to seek an injunction against Fiat from proceeding with the International Trade Commission (ITC) complaint that has been filed by it,” M&M said in a BSE statement on Wednesday. 
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) had earlier this month filed a complaint in the US alleging that Mahindra had infringed on the designs of its subsidiary, Jeep, with the new Mahindra Roxor, and sought to prevent the sale of the off-road vehicle in the US market.
“We are asking the court to block Fiat from participating in the ITC claim — an injunction — because of the fact that they agreed in 2009 to never bring such claims if we use a grille that they approved,” said the M&M statement. 
The Fiat complaint alleges that certain design features of the Mahindra Roxor infringe on the intellectual property rights of the Jeep design as it was modelled after the original Willys Jeep.
The Anand Mahindra company said Roxor was the result of more than three years of research and development and not an imported low-quality “knock-off” kit car as claimed by FCA. 
“There is no monetary claim such as compensation and damages sought by them. However, if they succeed in getting a permanent injunction from the company exporting infringing parts or components to the US and MANA importing the same the US, the company will not be able to sell such parts or components to the US and the sale of such parts or components by the company to MANA will be affected,” M&M said. 
The public interest statement has been filed by MANA, a subsidiary of Mahindra & Mahindra, arguing that Fiat is using the case to harm its Roxor business by creating negative publicity, damaging its reputation and stature in the marketplace. 
“We also demonstrated that the Roxor is a vehicle that was always intended only as off-road, does not compete with Fiat vehicles and is manufactured and assembled in the first OEM plant to be built in Michigan,” the company said in a statement.
M&M is also seeking an injunction against Fiat from proceeding with the complaint filed by it. 
Responding to shareholder concerns over a complaint filed by FCA in the US, Anand Mahindra recently said, “M&M didn’t go there (US market) without looking into all possible issues that we might or might not face. We are very confident that this case is without merit.”"
61,2018-08-30,Mahindra Mahindra,"‘For M&M to be truly global, we need a second home market’


Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, M&M
   -  PAUL NORONHA




Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, M&M
   -  PAUL NORONHA


Pawan Goenka looks thoughtful when the topic veers around to the need for auto-makers to go global.
The Managing Director of Mahindra & Mahindra then throws up a couple of questions to elaborate on the subject. “Is it for business growth? I don’t think so because India has ample growth opportunity. Is it for technology access? Perhaps not so, because technology is also easily accessible,” he explains.
From Goenka’s point of view, there are two obvious benefits that accrue from going global. One, a lot more competitiveness sets in because the levels across segments are a lot more intense outside India than within. Two, it helps the brand since customers look for global brands more often than not “no matter where you are”. They look to see in which other part of the world it has succeeded and this by itself becomes an attractive reason to buy the brand.
“Globalisation becomes important from the brand development point of view and the perspective of people changes significantly,” says Goenka. It is also his view that succeeding in a market like the US puts a brand in a different space than merely pulling it off in India. 
“I always tell youngsters seeking my advice that they should always work in the US for five years to get fresh perspectives and then come back. But those who have never left the country would always have something missing that they have not been exposed to,” says Goenka. He knows what he is talking about having spent years in the US before choosing to return to India. In the same way, this kind of globalisation is important for a brand like Mahindra too. Clearly, there is still some way to go even while the company has made some significant acquisitions like SsangYong in Korea and Pininfarina in Italy. 
Likewise, the intent to grow in the US market has taken off in the form of Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA) in Detroit, which has collaborated with teams in India for the Marazzo multi-purpose vehicle to be launched next week. All this, however, does not mean that the global target has been achieved. On the contrary, there is still a lot of work ahead to make it a reality. 
“For us to be called truly global, in all fairness, we need to have what we often internally call a second home market. This means another market where we are a significant player,” explains Goenka. 
He is candid enough to admit that Mahindra is still “not there yet” in the auto business and needs to develop one or two markets where it can emerge a significant player. This ideally should be on the lines of its small tractor business in the US, where it has made a mark but that remains just a solo region in the world map where Mahindra as a brand has significance. 
“We are still very small in other places and there is more reason to develop a second home market,” observes Goenka. In the auto business, there is only Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other neighbouring countries. Press him further and the Mahindra MD replies that “South Africa perhaps could be our second home market” considering that business is reasonably good there.
To that extent, there is tremendous work to make the global dream a reality even though the intent is in place. Auto-makers like M&M also have to contend with the fact that the global landscape is changing rapidly. No longer do things work in a predictable pattern, with a host of mobility disruptions underway right from the likes of Uber to electric and connected cars. Things are no different back home in India where the industry will now need to factor in big ticket changes like Bharat Stage VI emission norms, which become a reality in April 2020 as well as a host of clean fuel alternatives. “Most of what is happening is for a good cause and you cannot find fault with the need for cleaner and safer vehicles or better fuel efficiency. The only thing we get concerned about is the timing of doing these things since they do take time,” says Goenka. 
For instance, it is fine to address one issue but becomes a daunting challenge handling half a dozen more almost simultaneously. As he says, not everything can be deemed “very urgent” though it is now increasingly clear that auto-makers need to be prepared for many scenarios in order to remain stronger a decade from now. 
“There is no way you can make a five-year plan, which is linear. Any (five-year) plan will need to have many branches that come depending on what happens three or six months from now,” says Goenka. In the process, one will end up “changing course or going through a very turbulent river” to move on ahead.
There is really no choice by the end of the day. “This has to be done and if you cannot do it, you are out of the game. There is nobody who can say I am safe for the next 10 years — nobody!” reiterates Goenka. Hence, to tide over this, manufacturers create options since change is inevitable and they will have to cope with it.
This also explains why many of them are forging alliances to stay ahead of the race. This is particularly evident in Japan where Toyota and Suzuki have joined hands while Nissan has taken a controlling stake in Mitsubishi. Why, even old foes, Honda and Yamaha are jointly working on small scooters for Japan and there is every likelihood of the partnership getting stronger.
M&M, likewise, is back with Ford (they were partners for the Escort two decades earlier) and a host of options are being discussed. The Indian SUV-maker is also deepening its bond with SsangYong, which it acquired in 2011. A lot of work is being done on powertrains and the results will be known in the coming months. “On the vehicle side, we have S201 on the X100 platform and G4 Rexton, which is coming next year,” says Goenka. 
There is some work happening on the next platform too but this is clearly a more difficult exercise because of different requirements for the Korean and Indian car markets. Goenka is visibly pleased with the progress made with Pininfarina, which has seen some collaborations happening with the design teams in Italy and India. While a lot of work was done on the Marazzo, the more interesting initiative was with the Furio commercial vehicle range. 
It was perhaps for the first time that the Italian design firm had worked on a truck globally where insights were sought from end-users in locations like vegetable markets at unearthly hours in the morning. 
The Pininfarina team is now working on a tractor for Mahindra, which will be something to look forward to. Goenka will have reasons to feel optimistic about the road ahead."

   -  BUSINESS LINE




Mahindra & Mahindra launched its Marazzo people carrier at a press meet here on Monday. The introductory ex-showroom prices for the four variants range from Rs 9.99 lakh for the entry-level M2 option to Rs 13.9 lakh for the top-end M8. The M4 and M6 are priced at Rs 10 lakh and Rs 12.4 lakh each.
There are only diesel engine options for the Marazzo, with the petrol alternative likely to be introduced only with the onset of Bharat Stage VI emission norms in April 2020. Likewise, there is no automatic version for now, though this brand could also join the parade eventually, given the growing preference for the automatic in the market.
The Marazzo has been jointly engineered and designed by teams in Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA) in Detroit, Mahindra Research Valley in Chennai and Italian auto design firm, Pininfarina. To that extent, this is a creation across three continents.
The design inspiration is the shark and this is especially evident in the grille and tail lamps. “Sharks live the longest in the fish species and the only superior predator is the blue whale,” said Executive Chairman, Anand Mahindra. According to him, as much as the shark remained unchallenged in the seas, the Marazzo has the potential to be a long-term player in the automobile space.
Managing Director Pawan Goenka said the launch marked the day of the first verdict, while the final verdict would start coming in from Tuesday when customers get to see the Marazzo. M&M is pulling out all the stops across its dealerships to ensure that the buying experience for this vehicle is memorable.
From Goenka’s point of view, the company was confident and yet ‘somewhat nervous’ about the new offering, which was the most significant after the Scorpio and XUV500. “We will, hopefully, repeat history and look back at another icon 10 years from now,” he said."

57,2018-09-05,Mahindra Mahindra,"Spike in diesel price puts Govt in a spot
Auto fuel prices continue to give sleepless nights not only to consumers but the government as well, with elections round the corner and the Opposition stepping up its attack.
Diesel, the most popular transport fuel in the country, has seen a spike of ₹3.72 a litre from July 29 till date. It sold at ₹71.34 a litre in Delhi on Tuesday, steadily rising over daily price revisions from ₹67.62 a litre levels on July 29. Higher prices also mean transportation costs going up.
According to SP Singh, Senior Fellow and Coordinator at the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training (IFTRT), truck rentals and retail parcel freight charges were up in the first two weeks of August by 4- 5 per cent, when diesel price had increased by ₹1.30 a litre. However, most are waiting for September numbers to come in for a clearer picture to emerge.
Companies such as Mahindra Logistics alter the prices every month after any change in fuel and other costs. Mahindra Logistics CEO Pirozshaw Sarkari said: “One of the main components of transportation is fuel and it basically is a pass-on.”
But do high prices lead to a major decline in diesel consumption? “Not really,” said a petrol pump owner. “There is a drop, but not a huge decline. At present, the decline in consumption is also because of the rains.”
The Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell concurs that the present price levels of diesel do not translate into a tapering of consumption. Fuel costs zoomed to the previous record levels of ₹69.30 a litre in May this year. But diesel consumption during the month increased, both sequentially and annually, to 7.55 million tonnes.
In fact, car sales numbers indicate that they are hardly impacted by rising diesel costs. Automakers, especially in the commercial vehicle segment, saw a growth in sales in August. Most of the companies, including Ashok Leyland, Volvo Eicher, Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, reported double-digit growth annually.
In the passenger vehicle segment, too, diesel engine-oriented manufacturers such as Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors saw growth in sales. However, Maruti Suzuki India has seen a dip in diesel vehicle sales over the past few months. Its petrol:diesel car sales ratio has changed from 60:40 to 70:30.
Though the government is adopting a wait-and-watch approach, those in know say it is left with limited options in dealing with a spike. “Yes, we are studying the ground reactions, but we are also aware that our options are very restricted,” said a government source. “In fact, even our own (BJP-run) States cannot be taken for granted as far as fuel price is concerned.”
Bringing down the excise duty by a rupee or two will not serve the purpose, said an official, adding: “Last year the Centre had reduced the excise duty on fuel and the Finance Minister had appealed to the States to reduce the local taxes, but only Goa responded.”
The bulk of government revenues (both Centre and States) comes from fuel taxes. There is a ₹15.33 a litre excise duty and ₹10.46 a litre VAT on diesel. Till now, four States and one Union Territory have reduced taxes on auto fuel.
In fact, the elections may also compel the Railways, the largest bulk buyer of diesel, to find means to pass it on to the consumers. Instead of a direct tariff hike, it may tinker with revenue generators, such as food, parking and cancellation charges.
The Railways has already been increasing its pace of electrification to control costs. More electrification will lower the diesel fuel costs. It is also increasingly converting its diesel locomotives to electric ones.
The higher diesel costs also play havoc with inflation calculations. For statistical purposes, diesel is part of the fuel and energy group in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) with a weight of 7.94. Diesel alone weighs 3.10 in the Wholesale Price Index. So the changes in retail prices of various fuels prices impact the overall retail inflation numbers.

Looking towards the future Anand Mahindra, Executive Chairman, Mahindra & Mahindra
   -  PAUL NORONHA




Looking towards the future Anand Mahindra, Executive Chairman, Mahindra & Mahindra
   -  PAUL NORONHA


From Anand Mahindra’s point of view, the Marazzo is more than just another vehicle offering from his company.
“As I have always said earlier, the challenge is not about technology but the quality of the technology coming in, collaboration, dialogue, communication and so on. Those are the things that usually end up in a sense subverting a project,” the Executive Chairman of Mahindra & Mahindra told BusinessLine.
The Marazzo marks a triumph of skills and competencies bending successfully across different parts of the world. The people carrier, as M&M terms it, was jointly developed and designed by teams at Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA), Mahindra Research Valley in Chennai and Italian auto design firm, Pininfarina along with counterparts at the Mahindra Design Studio in Mumbai.
As a result, the Marazzo is the first product from the M&M stable that has literally been created across three continents. “What I am very pleased about is that this experiment has worked not only because we see a very fine car but because these three (entities) had equal passion and equal diligence in finishing a product,” added Mahindra.
It is hardly surprising then that the trio is already working on the next product, which should become a reality in the not-so-distant future. Both MANA and Pininfarina are part of the Mahindra group and the Marazzo has shown that diverse groups can come together for a common goal. 
“Normally, you get finger-pointing… so and so did not do this or that person did not do it on time. The blame game is what kills global coordination. I am very pleased to say that I think we sorted that problem out, which means that the future is very bright,” said an upbeat Mahindra. The Marazzo will aggressively target prospective buyers in Tier 2/3 regions in addition to the big metros. Beyond a family vehicle, it will also appeal to singles and young couples looking out for long weekend drives. 
And while M&M is steering clear of any reference to the Marazzo as a multi-purpose vehicle, it is a fair bet to say that its price tag will make a connect with those aspiring to buy the Toyota Innova Crysta (Maruti Suzuki’s Ertiga is the other option in the MPV space).
“As an object of desire, the Marazzo is what will be a family vehicle or people carrier,” said Mahindra at the launch in Nashik. Sure, the world has seen MPVs like the Renault Espace but they were by and large “cars for soccer moms”. According to him, the MPVs of old really had no personality or passion. “Our challenge was to give the Marazzo a personality.”
Mahindra recalled the time Rick Haas, the President and CEO of MANA, took him for a ride on this vehicle, which was then codenamed u321 to feel the experience. Out there in Detroit while driving on the expressway, Mahindra said he “felt like a little kid with this big rush of blood and a sense of what globalisation is about”. 
To that extent, the Marazzo is as transformative perhaps as the Scorpio and XUV500 were to the company earlier. “The Scorpio was transformative because it was a step jump in our ambition and aspiration. The XUV was a leap of faith in design and this one (Marazzo) is a leap of faith that we can take three centres of development and make them co-create a product,” explained Mahindra. 
He then recounted the time he first saw the XUV500. Accompanying him was a 25-year-old who exclaimed ‘Wow’ when he saw the prototype. “My jaw dropped too. XUV took us into the realm of high design . People love things of beauty and M&M’s romance with design began then,” said Mahindra.
There is, of course, no question that the company has come a long way since the launch of the Scorpio way back in 2002. During that point in time, the success of this product was critical to M&M’s relevance as an SUV player. It had broken off with Ford to focus solely on this project and all the hard work paid off.
Since then, M&M has spread its wings through acquisitions like SsangYong Motors in 2011 even while making a brief comeback in cars through a joint venture with Renault to make the Logan. It has now joined hands again with former ally, Ford, to explore a host of options in areas like SUVs, electric vehicles and connectivity.
Beyond this, M&M has also articulated its intent to look at other mobility solutions like trucks and buses as well as two-wheelers. While some progress is happening in the former, the same cannot be said for its two-wheeler business. Meanwhile, tractors continue to be a strong growth pillar with new global beachheads like Japan, Finland and Turkey. 
Anand Mahindra also knows only too well that there are a host of challenges ahead in the mobility space. It was during the TUV300 launch in 2015 when he spoke of the threat to car ownership from options like Uber. 
“Potentially, the bigger threat is from the age of access. We live in an age of the Olas and Ubers and transportation is a commodity that will be given to you,” he had said then.
Things have been changing even more rapidly since then with new frontiers like connected cars, electric mobility and so on. “If you talk to any auto-maker around the world, they will always be scratching their heads. Nobody has a real clue on how this landscape will change. It is a landscape that has an element of uncertainty that it has never seen before in any time,” Mahindra elaborated to this writer after the Marazzo launch.
So, what was the way out in such a challenging environment? M&M clearly sees no reason to press the panic button. “What most OEMs are doing, I suspect, (as are we) is that you are building scenarios and creating options for all those scenarios,” he said. 
These include ride-sharing and how it is going to change the intra-urban commuting space as also electric and autonomous cars. “Who are the players there, we don’t know.. it’s up in the air. Everyday, there is talk about Apple becoming a competitor there, Google and Waymo are coming in too,” said Mahindra.
As he put it, how much more dynamic can a landscape get? The solution, therefore, is to have scenarios where “you can continue to play in that field and we intend to”. 
The second opportunity for companies like M&M is the heartland, which is where cars are recreational and lifestyle products. “We have more people for long journeys and there are cars, which are expression of personality for people. We believe SUVs have much more scope in that space than the boring sedan if I may,” added Mahindra. Yet, he made it clear that the company would not focus on market share but on products that are lusted after by customers
The final opportunity is what he referred to as “objects of obsession”, which is the luxury market, the fastest growing in the last five years. “The luxury market has not come down and we intend to get a piece of that pie with the Pininfarina association,” said the M&M Chairman."

We expect M&M to sustain the ongoing positive momentum on the back of the government’s strong rural thrust coupled with the near-normal monsoon. As M&M’s key product portfolio continues to be rural-focussed, it would continue to enjoy the benefits of improving rural affordability.
Though M&M’s present product line in the automotive segment is lean, its recent launch of Marazzo coupled with expected new launches (S201 and Y400) in the upcoming festive season would help regain lost market share to some extent.

53,2018-09-28,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra Powerol enters marine engine market
 Mahindra Powerol, a business unit of the $21-billion Mahindra Group, has forayed into building marine engines with its Seahawk Series to take on Chinese companies that have a majority share in this sector.
The engines, of power ranging between 24 hp and 300 hp, include 11 variants of engines and generators that power fishing boats, trawlers and small tugs.
The company had ventured into the marine sector in 2016 with engines designed at Mahindra Research Valley near Chennai. The engines were then tested for a year in various locations, said Sachin Nijhawan, Business Head, Powerol, Mahindra & Mahindra.
The annual demand for marine engines of 15-400 hp (costing ₹1.5-7 lakh) is around 3,000 units with Chinese companies having 60-70 per cent share. “We are now offering a 100 per cent ‘Made in India’ product and would like to take away a significant share from Chinese companies,” said M Senthilkumaran, General Manager, Industrial Applications, M&M.
Senthilkumaran said six Long Line Trawlers being built at Cochin Shipyard Ltd will be fitted with the Mahindra engines. These trawlers are being built under the ‘Blue Revolution’ deep-sea fishing scheme launched by the Centre in Rameshwaram last November.
Along with the Centre’s contribution of ₹200 crore, the Tamil Nadu government had also allotted ₹86 crore to the scheme. A total of 2,000 bottom-trawlers will be customised as long-liners at a cost of ₹1,621 crore in three phases.
In the first phase, of 16 customers, six fishermen in Rameshwaram selected Mahindra marine engines, said Senthilkumaran. “We hope hope to get good orders from the Tamil Nadu fishing community in Rameswaram under the Centre’s deep-sea fishing programme,” he said.
Mahindra Powerol is present in four categories — construction, fire-fighting pumps, buses, and marine engines. It has sold nearly 500 engines, each costing an average of ₹3 lakh. “We should multiply this quantity from now on,” he said."

Except for a few commercial vehicle players and two-wheeler makers, most automobile companies reported a decline in sales or, at best, a marginal growth in September. This was mainly due to a higher base in the corresponding month last year and subdued demand in the North India due to the shradh period.
For instance, in the passenger car segment, market leader Maruti Suzuki India reported a decline in sales year-on-year (YoY) to around 1.15 lakh units in September 2018, against 1.17 lakh units in September 2017. .
However, in the total domestic passenger vehicles segment sales, it managed to grow marginally at more than 1.51 lakh units during the month, against 1.50 lakh units last year.
Toyota Kirloskar Motor also managed to grow marginally during the month, led by strong demand in the Crysta, Fortuner, Yaris and Etios Liva.
Creta maker Hyundai Motor India reported a 5 per cent drop in YoY sales to 47,781 units (50,028 units). Similarly, Honda Cars India reported a 19 per cent decline in sales to 14,820 units (18,257 units).








 
Home-grown Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) also reported a 16 per cent decline in sales to 21,411 units (25,414 units).
“September has been muted for passenger vehicles due to factors such as low consumer buying sentiment, high fuel prices and the effect of monsoon in many parts of the country,” said Rajan Wadhera, President, Automotive Sector, M&M.
However, Tata Motors reported a 7 per cent growth to 18,429 units last month (17,286 units) due to continued demand from new-generation vehicles, the company said.
“We expect sales to pick up this festival season and, to boost our customer morale, we are bringing four new products to the market. We have already launched the Nexon KRAZ and the Tiago NRG and are now gearing up for our third product launch, scheduled for October 10,” said Mayank Pareek, President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors.
In the two-wheeler segment, market leader Hero MotoCorp reported its highest-ever monthly sales at 7.69 lakh units during the month, up around 7 per cent as compared with around 7.21 lakh units in September 2017.

“Start-ups don’t know what doesn’t work and not knowing what doesn’t work leads to inventions,” said Pawan Goenka, MD, Mahindra & Mahindra, on the inaugural day of 37th FISITA World Automotive Congress 2018 here on Wednesday.
Speaking at the biennial global automotive confluence organised by FISITA and the Society of Automotive Engineers India (SAEINDIA), Goenka said large organisations know what has failed in the past and will never try it again, whereas start-ups don’t know what techniques failed in the past. 
“Sometimes what failed in the past may succeed in the future,” Goenka added.
Highlighting the growth of Electric Vehicles (EV), Goenka said most of the EVs on display at the event are made by start-ups as much as it comes from large Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). 
“In a sense the industry (auto) is moving towards an era of start-ups and there are many start-up companies waiting to pounce on this momentum,” Goenka said. 
Lauding IIT-Madras for creating an ecosystem to nurture start-ups, Goenka who is also the Chairman of the Board of Governors of IIT-M, said start-ups in automobile industry will play a major role in future and OEMs in Tier-1 must learn to co-exist with start-ups and nurture them to match industry standards. 
The four-day conclave held for the first time in India, will see automobile and component manufacturers display their latest products and cutting-edge technologies in the world of automobiles. 
The plenary sessions will see industry leaders — both from India and abroad — address key disruptions in the industry such as Autonomous, Connected, Electric, Shared mobility and a concluding panel discussion on policy framing for disruptive technologies. 
The event also saw the launch of General Motors Technical Centre India’s locally built Range Extended Electric Vehicle (REEV), a prototype vehicle designed exclusively for the national REEV student competition to be held next year. 
The competition, which will replicate OEM-level car making experience, urges engineering students to create vehicles that are transformative and viable in the real world including important parameters such as energy efficiency, ergonomics, electrification, low cost and mass efficiency."

44,2018-11-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"How Blazo has blazed a new trail for M&M in heavy trucks
Rajan Wadhera will have reasons to be pleased when the Blazo X is launched on Friday.
For the President of Mahindra and Mahindra’s (M&M) automotive sector, this will be an important occasion from the viewpoint of the turnaround story in the heavy duty truck business.
It has not been the easiest of journeys with its share of ups and downs but, by the end of the day, extremely satisfying for Wadhera and his team. How brand Blazo came into being and heralded M&M’s comeback in the heavy truck space can make for an interesting case study. 
Wadhera looks thoughtful as the memories come flooding back. He goes back a decade to 2008 when the value from a truck largely boiled down to its overloading ability and turnaround time. This was the time when it was perfectly normal for a 25-tonne vehicle to carry loads nearly twice as much.
“When we began making trucks 10 years ago, these were the only attributes that mattered,” recalls Wadhera. Turnaround time is a factor of power and higher speeds, and for a truck to carry excessive loads, it had to be truly durable.
M&M, quite naturally, focussed on a high 220 hp engine of 7.2-litre capacity, which was the best bet for overloading, good speed and better turnaround. Launched in 2011, the truck hit all the right notes and customers were pleased.
The trucks came in three brands — Torro, Traco and Truxo — with their niches clearly defined in the tipper, tractor trailer and haulage spaces respectively. Things were looking good till two events occurred that hit the industry hard.
The first was the slowdown in heavy commercial vehicles while the other pertained to a legislative reduction on overloading. It was quite apparent that these hugely overloaded trucks were damaging roads at a time when infrastructure development was priority.
“The value our trucks were delivering suddenly changed when they became fuel guzzlers,” says Wadhera. This was but natural when trucks that carried 25 tonnes would now carry only 10 tonnes. To top it all, the distinct red that epitomised the Mahindra truck trio suddenly became synonymous with fuel guzzlers. 
“Because of the ban on overload, we were hit by the value change of the customer and the business cycle. We had to lighten our trucks and literally put them on a diet,” he adds. 
Work began in right earnest and 600 kg was knocked off as part of the effort in working towards better fuel efficiency. In 2015, when Wadhera moved to handle the trucks business, he was also in charge of technology, product development and sourcing. 
“I realised that the value we could give was technology and we moved over from a mechanical to electronic engine. The entire fuelling system became electronic,” he explains. M&M also had a decade of common rail diesel engine technology experience and the entire team of powertrain engineers from the Chennai-based Mahindra Research Valley pulled out all the stops to install this technology in the truck.
Additionally, the team also installed the smart fuel technology where the electronic engine literally takes over the driving habits. In the process, this would ensure a control on fuel supply, whether a truck was going at top speed or travelling uphill. 
“We now had the value and our trucks were more fuel-efficient. We got them checked with the help of a reputed consulting house and saw a clear fuel benefit on mileage vis-a-vis rival models,” says Wadhera. The challenge, though, was to convince fleet operators since seeing is believing by the end of the day. 
This is when 100 drivers were hired on Mahindra rolls and trained rigorously. With every truck sold, one of these drivers would be relocated for a month with the truck to establish its fuel efficiency. Keeping him company was the fleet owner’s own driver.
The effort was laudable but clearly a tall order from the viewpoint of convincing every owner that the new trucks were indeed more fuel-efficient than their predecessors. It was also clear that there was the 3T (Torro, Traco and Truxo) brand overhang, which meant that this memory, including the red colour association, had to be erased quickly.
This was when the Blazo was born and M&M decided to stick to this single brand for its truck range, ranging from 25 tonnes to 49 tonnes to avoid any confusion. The next step was to kick off a campaign and Bollywood star Ajay Devgn was roped in to drive home the message of fuel efficiency. 
The Blazo now sported a new colour to convey the idea of value to the customer. This was followed by a guarantee campaign to ensure supply of spares and service. Word gradually got around that the Blazo was indeed something different and this is when buyers began queuing up gradually.
The efforts have paid off and M&M’s share in the heavy truck space (25-49t) has doubled to nearly five per cent today. It is now in the fourth spot behind Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland and BharatBenz. What then is Blazo X all about?
“If we are now taking a technology plank that we are the most fuel-efficient trucks, we don’t want others to come and say their fuel efficiency is better. We have therefore improved our trucks through many technologies and are calling it Blazo X,” explains Wadhera. 
In short, this range is even more fuel efficient where Devgn once again drives home the message in the recently-launched TV campaign. “Since we have developed the most fuel efficient truck in the industry, it is our responsibility to take it to the next level with Blazo X,” says Wadhera. 
The company is also focussing on other brand-building initiatives like the Mahindra Transport Excellence Awards as well as the the two-week course for young transporters at IIM-Ahmedabad. Today, M&M’s truck dealers are a lot happier since numbers are building up, which is key to their viability. “Our vision is to have 10 per cent market share in this space over the next three-four years,” says Wadhera. 
He believes that there will be hectic buying next fiscal before the onset of Bharat Stage VI emission norms in 2020, which will see vehicles becoming a lot more expensive. Fleet owners will naturally be keen to buy the existing BS IV range that can hold their own for at least five years.
It now remains to be seen whether this frizzed buying will impact demand for BS VI trucks post April 2020, but things may not be so bad if old trucks are compulsorily scrapped. Similarly, good economic growth will ensure that the boom story in trucks continues through the following decade. 
Meanwhile, M&M has “horizontally deployed” the guarantee message of the Blazo in its pick-up segment where another Bollywood star, Manoj Bajpayee, has done the honours in spreading the word. He was part of the Jeeto campaign and is now the face of M&M’s pick-up space with Devgn at the other end for heavy trucks."

 Mahindra & Mahindra on Wednesday reported 23.87 per cent jump in standalone profit after tax at Rs 1,649.46 crore for the second quarter ended September 30.
 The company had posted standalone net profit of Rs 1,331.57 crore in the same quarter last fiscal, M&M said in a regulatory filing.
 Total income during the period under review stood at Rs 13,834.87 crore. It was at Rs 12,745.49 crore in the year-ago quarter. Vehicle sales during the second quarter stood at 1,41,163 units as against 129,754 units in the same period last fiscal, a growth of 9 per cent, the company said.
 Tractor sales were, however, down by 5 per cent to 73,012 units in the second quarter as against 76,984 units in the year-ago period, it added. The company exported 9,244 vehicles during the current quarter, a growth of 18.9 per cent over the corresponding quarter previous year.
 On the outlook, the company said, “Going forward, growth will be a function of evolving liquidity conditions as well as private and government spending.” Among global factors, crude oil price behaviour and US-China trade policy manoeuvring will be the key factors to watch out for, it said."
41,2018-11-14,Mahindra Mahindra,"M&M’s profit up 26%
Mahindra & Mahindra posted a 26 per cent rise in net profit at ₹1,779 for the quarter ended September 30 compared with the same period last year.
However, below-than-expected festive sales forced the company to cut its sales outlook for passenger vehicles to 7-8 per cent for the financial year as against the 10 per cent target previously announced.
Revenues were up 6 per cent on a yearly basis to ₹12,790 crore. “PV demands have been subdued in Q2 and even in Q3 so far. While festive sales were better than last year, they fell short of expectations. While we previously said that we’ll be able to close the year with a double-digit growth in PV, now we expect it to be only around 7-8 per cent,” said Pawan Goenka, managing director at Mahindra & Mahindra.
UV sales fell 9.5 per cent in the quarter, given the rise in fuel prices, uncertainty over diesel vehicles and rising interest rates, Goenka said. PV sales, for the first time, were higher from the rural segment as the automaker saw 2 per cent growth in rural segment, while there was a drop in the urban sales.
The auto segment is also facing margin pressures with rise in commodity prices. While there was an impact of 250 basis points in the auto segment, Goenka said nearly half of that was passed on to the customers, while the rest was either absorbed by M&M or handled by improving efficiencies.
For Q2 FY19, the auto industry (excluding two wheelers) posted a moderate growth of 4.8 percent. This was due to a high base from Q2 FY18, shift of the festival season to Q3 FY19 and partial slowing down of demand for passenger vehicles, especially in the urban areas."

Jawa, the iconic Czech motorcycle brand, has been reborn under the ownership of the Mahindra group as the company launched the first range in India.
The Jawa and Jawa Forty Two are the brand’s new torch bearers, bringing back the classic appeal of Jawa with modern fittings. The bikes have an all-new 293cc, liquid cooled, single cylinder, DOHC engine nestled within a double cradle chassis.
The Jawa is priced at Rs 1,64,000 and the Jawa Forty Two at Rs 1,55,000. 
The Jawa brand, popular in the sixties along with the British brand Royal Enfield, will vie with its former competitor, which has seen no competition for many decades.
Jawa also unveiled the Jawa Perak, powered by a 334cc, liquid cooled, single cylinder, DOHC engine which develops 30bhp power and 31nm of torque. The Perak is priced at Rs 1,89,000 and the booking dates are yet to be revealed.
The bikes are being built through contract manufacturing by the group to limit the investment required to relaunch the brand. The company will initially focus on sales in India before planning for exports.
Anupam Thareja, founder of Mahindra Groups’s Classic Legends, said the company has already set up 105 dealerships across the country and may look at opening another 70 in the near future, depending on the response towards the bikes.
“Jawa Motorcycles has enjoyed a huge fan following and generations have relished riding these iconic motorcycles. Modern classics are becoming more popular since people today are looking for character, style and fun,” Thareja said.
“It is rare to get an opportunity to resurrect a legend,” said Mahindra group Chairman Anand Mahindra. “Jawa is an authentic and iconic brand that represents the desire and yearning in all of us for freedom and adventure.”"

 Home grown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) has put on hold plans to introduce SsangYong brand in the U.S, a top company official said.
 The company is also averse to introducing SsangYong Motor Company branded cars in India in the short to medium term.
“If we had done the launch of SsangYong in the US we probably would have launched it with a different name...in fact we have decided right now to put it on hold (US launch),” M&M Managing Director Pawan Goenka told reporters here on the sidelines of the launch of SUV Alturas G4.
 He was replying to a query if the Mumbai-based firm was planning to change the name of its South Korean subsidiary which it acquired in 2011.
 Goenka said the jury is still out on the matter, with some supporting a name change while others opposing it.
“Our global distributors are against it. As of now we have not decided on it as this matter is not in our priority list right now” he added.
 Last year, Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra, while inaugurating its $230 million new plant in Detroit in the US, had indicated that the company may enter the American car market with its South Korean subsidiary.
 However, the company later launched off-road model Roxor under the Mahindra brand in the market.
 Commenting on bringing the brand to India, Goenka said: “In the short-term to medium-term horizon we don’t see SsangYong brand coming here“.
He added that there is really no need because Mahindra brand is fairly established in the domestic market.
“As long as we are able to get the connect with Korean manufacturing and engineering, I don’t think we need to bring SsangYong brand here,” Goenka noted.
The company sells Alturas G4 brand in Korea under SsangYong Rexton brand but has launched the vehicle here under the Mahindra badge.
 It also plans to launch the upcoming compact SUV code-named S201, which is based on SsangYong Tivoli, under the Mahindra brand.
“To establish a new brand in any new market is huge effort and not something that can easily work. Many well known big SUV brands have not been able to sell (in India). It is a wise thing for us to do,” Goenka said.
 M&M Saturday forayed into the premium SUV space with the launch of Alturas G4 priced between ₹26.95 lakh and ₹29.95 lakh (ex-showroom).
 The company is aiming to sell around 450-500 units of the new model per month."

Alturas will take prominence while the Mahindra brand will endorse the product on the lines of what was done with the Scorpio launched in 2002.


Mahindra & Mahindra has come up with a new brand strategy for its Alturas G4 luxury SUV launched in Jaipur last week.
This is the first vehicle from the M&M portfolio that will not have an ‘O’ at the end of its name (like the Scorpio, Bolero and Marazzo). Two, there is no SsangYong Motor branding association though the vehicle is known as the G4 Rexton in Korea.
Three, Alturas will take prominence while the Mahindra brand will endorse the product on the lines of what was done with the Scorpio launched in 2002. “We want brand Alturas to get prominence and are putting ‘By Mahindra’ below,” Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, M&M, told journalists at a roundtable. By doing this, customers will relate directly to the product and not the corporate brand. This has been done keeping in mind that this is the first luxury SUV from M&M with a price tag near the ₹30-lakh mark. The next in the hierarchy, in terms of pricing, is the XUV 500 which is sold for half as much.
Clearly, M&M’s strategy is to play up Alturas even if the corporate brand takes a backseat in the process. “That is what we did with Scorpio though we did not think it was necessary with XUV 500,” said Goenka. At that point in time, it was not that big a jump from Scorpio’s ₹8-9 lakh price to XUV’s ₹11-12 lakh price tag.
“Now we are going from ₹15-16 lakh of XUV to a price that is in the ballpark of ₹30 lakh. It is almost double from our current positioning and that is the reason why we decided to give prominence to Alturas,” he added.
The premium SUV space is hardly exciting in terms of numbers — about 4,500 units a month are sold — but significant in terms of brand positioning. The segment is dominated by models such as Ford Endeavour and Toyota Fortuner.
M&M believes that even a 10-12 per cent market share for Alturas would “really strengthen” its brand. “ This is a strategic and not commercial launch in terms of implications for the brand,” said Goenka.
The decision to underplay the SsangYong association was taken after a lot of deliberation. In Rexton’s case, it was important to establish the Korean connect. But today, customers are aware of this fact and there is really no reason to push the point.
“In the Indian context, having a Korean connect is valuable because there is a high credibility of the Korean ecosystem in terms of engineering, quality, fit & finish,” said Goenka. The SsaangYong association will extend to the S201 compact SUV, derived from Tivoli and due to be launched in the coming months. Yet, there is no reason to extend the Korean automaker’s brand to India.
“The Mahindra brand is well established and as long as there is a connect with Korean manufacturing and engineering, there is no need to establish a new brand which is a huge effort,” explained Goenka. According to him, the Rexton launched earlier did not do well because it was at the end of its lifecycle and customers did not want a dated product.
However, market observers believe the M&M decision could also have been spurred by the fact that customers in India are familiar with stronger Korean brands like Hyundai and Kia; the latter is due to launch its debut SUV next year.

In a big boost to Mahindra, the US Trade Commission’s investigative staff has found no merit in Fiat Chrysler’s complaint against the Indian automaker for allegedly copying the grille design of Fiat Jeep. However, the International Trade Commission judge is yet to give a final order.
“The Commission Investigative Staff believes that Mahindra & Mahindra and Mahindra Automotive North America, Inc. met their burden of establishing that FCA US LLC is contractually barred from enforcing its intellectual property rights against Mahindra’s importation of the accused vehicle,” the investigating staff told the International Trade Commission judge in a written statement.
“FCA is contractually barred from pursuing this investigation if Mahindra’s vehicles contain or use the approved grille design. The evidence shows that Mahindra’s Roxor uses the approved grille design. Thus, the record supports a finding that Mahindra met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that FCA is contractually barred from pursuing this Investigation,” the statement added.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in August had filed a complaint in the US to prevent the sale of Mahindra’s Roxor there on the grounds that Mahindra had infringed the designs of its subsidiary, Jeep. The company said Mahindra Roxor is modelled after the original Willys Jeep. In response,Mahindra filed a complaint in Federal Court in Michigan on the issue of the applicability and enforcement of its 2009 agreement with Fiat. Mahindra said that Fiat agreed in 2009 to never bring such claims if it used a grille that Fiat approved. The Roxor uses that grille.
The off-road vehicle Roxor is based on Mahindra’s Thar without the hard rooftop and windscreen. Mahindra says it spent three years developing the Roxor for the US market.
“The Commission’s Investigative Staff has stated its support of Mahindra’s position and concluded that FCA is contractually barred from pursuing this investigation,” an M&M spokesperson said."

A high-powered government committee had earlier this year accorded it the ultra mega project status.
As per the state tourism policy of 2016, an ultra mega project would require a capital investment of Rs 500 crore and to employ 750 people and complete it in 84 months.
The GR said since the Mahindra Group’s project fulfils the criteria, it was accorded the ultra mega project status.
During the Magnetic Maharashtra investor summit here in February, Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra had said they were exploring to set up a unique film-centric entertainment destination on their land at Kandivali as Mumbai is the heart of Hindi film industry.
This will create hundreds of direct and indirect jobs, he had said.

M&M has spruced up its UV portfolio this year through recent launches such as the Marazzo

M&M has spruced up its UV portfolio this year through recent launches such as the Marazzo
   -  BUSINESS LINE


With a twin play on utility vehicles (UVs) and tractors, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) is well-placed to recapture the demand in both rural and urban areas. Populist measures in the run-up to the elections, including farm loan waivers and farm income support schemes, may boost consumption in the first half of 2019. 
Why BuyGrowing consumer interest in UVsTractor sales on a highAttractive valuation
Beyond that, pre-buying before the implementation of BS-VI norms in April 2020 (which will make vehicles costlier) will aid higher offtake. The stock trades at an attractive valuation of 19.5 times its estimated standalone earnings for 2018-19. Investors with a horizon of one to two years can buy the stock.
With highly successful models such as Bolero, Scorpio and XUV500, M&M has been a dominant player in the UV segment. But M&M’s market share in this space has declined steadily from over 50 per cent in the beginning of this decade to about 25 per cent now. The company has seen erosion in market share over the years due to several reasons. 








 
Initially in 2014, deregulation of diesel narrowed the gap between petrol and diesel prices and led to some drift to petrol UVs, while M&M primarily had diesel offerings. 
Following this, M&M had to face stiff competition from compact UVs such as the Ecosport (Ford), Duster (Renualt), SX4 S-Cross, Vitara Brezza (Maruti Suzuki), and Creta (Hyundai) in the last few years. 
With the Quanto not taking off as expected, the company had a gap in its product portfolio until it introduced compact/entry-level UVs such as the TUV300 and the KUV100. But these too were not instant hits. 
Later on, in 2016, the ban on sale of diesel vehicles with engine capacity over 2,000 cc in Delhi for over six months affected the sale of models such as the Scorpio and XUV500.
With many players now in the game, M&M may not be able to go back to its 45-50 per cent market share. But structurally, the Indian auto buyer is gravitating towards bigger cars and UVs. 
ALSO READ: India is now gearing up for the urban UV boom
UVs now constitute 27 per cent of the total passenger vehicles sold, from about 12 per cent in 2010-11. M&M will be a beneficiary of this trend. It has spruced up its UV portfolio this year through recent launches such as the Marazzo and the Alturas G4 in the mid and premium segments. The XUV 300 in the highly competitive compact segment will be launched before the end of this fiscal.
Two years of bad monsoon in 2014-15 and 2015-16 pulled down domestic tractor sales sharply. Industry volumes declined by 11-13 per cent for each of these years.
But then things stared getting better, thanks to favourable monsoon as well as measures taken by the government to boost rural economy. 








 
Thus, tractor industry volumes turned around, growing by 18-22 per cent in each of the last two fiscals. 
M&M’s volumes moved up in line with the industry or even slightly higher, in 2016-17 and 2017-18. 
The company is the market leader in tractors with a 42.9 per cent share as at end-March 2018.
Apart from an upturn in the industry, timely launches also helped M&M. The YUVO launched in April 2016 in the 32-45 HP range — segments which account for 70-80 per cent of the industry — was a huge success. 
ALSO READ: Tractor firms shrug off H2 worries, hopeful of a good year
Besides, in the last two years, the company also launched the JIVO in the sub 25 HP tractor segment, specifically designed for horticulture applications, as well as the Novo in the 65-75 HP range. 
A higher HP model in the Swaraj brand was also launched in 2017-18.
The company had earlier projected a volume growth of 12-14 per cent for tractors in 2018-19. 
Despite the recent slowdown, it expects a 12 per cent growth. Until November 2018, tractor volumes for the company have grown at 10 per cent. 
With three successive years of double-digit growth, a high base is a dampener for 2019-20. 
Nevertheless, a revival in demand due to reasons mentioned earlier will help tractor volumes.
For the half-year ended September 2018, standalone net sales grew by 11.4 per cent to ₹26,508 crore, while adjusted profits grew by 32.3 per cent to ₹2,754 crore. 
Operating margins improved marginally from 12.5 per cent a year ago to 13.1 per cent in April-September 2018. 
But much of this has been influenced by the good performance in the first quarter, thanks to double-digit volume growth in both the auto and tractor segments and margin expansion of about 190 basis points."

26,2019-02-06,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra XUV 300 review
Mahindra’s sports utility vehicles have been making big strides in quality, refinement and performance starting from the Scorpio. Some of the others that followed have bettered and pushed up the mark, but have still fallen short of global benchmarks in these parameters. 
Take, for example, the XUV 500 I was being chauffeured in from Goa Airport to the hotel where I was due to test drive the smaller sibling (by nomenclature) the XUV 300. The former has an aggressive front design, big muscled, upright SUV stance and a decently kitted out interior. It also offers a quiet cabin and a fairly refined, though a shade over-soft, ride. The trouble, though, is the finish quality of the XUV 500’s cabin - panels don’t join precisely to form clean lines across the dashboard and the plastic quality is just above the mass-market segment. Similarly, the shut lines are tight for the exterior panels, but where metal meets plastic the finish is inconsistent. 
Mahindra has outsourced some of the refinement work in the past to outfits like Lotus, but now it has access to in-house expertise from SsangYong. In fact, it has had access to the Korean company’s vehicles themselves, even though as the previous generation Rexton proved, the SsangYong brand doesn’t quite enjoy much of a recall in India. After badging the Rexton, as the Alturas G4, Mahindra is now all set to bring the Tivoli to our shores bearing the XUV 300 badge. 
It is tempting to dismiss the new sub-four-metre SUV as a clone of the Tivoli, but the fact is there has been considerable work done on the XUV 300. Walking up to the parking lot and meeting the XUV 300 for the first time, makes it seem like the most obvious job was to chop it to size. The Tivoli is about 4.2 metres in length and the mandate for the engineering team in Mahindra was to get it to under four metres. So, while the wheelbase remains the same, the XUV 300’s front and rear fenders are flatter, tighter members compared to the Tivoli. Some of the body side panels and the tail-gate also had to be significantly altered and designed to fit the reduced length of the body, and to reflect the Mahindra lineage, according to company officials. Of course, the more upright bonnet slab and the grille are entirely new and also are meant to deliver the brand’s evolving design language.










 










 








 
The black and chrome broken-line style grille and the unique rectangular headlamps that seem to drip down the sides leading into the fog lamps give the XUV 300 a very different front design. LED daytime running light tubes that frame the top of the headlamps run down the sides giving it a nice night time signature. The front fender features what looks like a huge airdam with horizontal chrome bands that enhance the perception of the XUV 300’s width. Compared to the Tivoli, the Mahindra SUV gets bigger, squared-off wheel arches with a dimple-style crease running above the black cladding to make it even more pronounced. The vehicle itself is sprung taller and gets bigger rims too, making it look more masculine compared to its Korean counterpart.








 
The angle from which the XUV 300 is the weakest is the side profile. Not that we aren’t already used to seeing abrupt rear-ends from Mahindra, but I felt that it could’ve been more proportionate for this one. But, the pressures of keeping it under four metres has meant that the tail-gate is less curved and shuts flush with a flatter rear fender with literally no overhang. But, with blacked out A, B and C pillars, and a contrast white roof with a rear spoiler, the floating roof effect is captured very well. The unnamed top-trim XUV 300 I was testing also sported a sunroof with the Ssangyong sticker still on one corner. It doesn’t look awkward when viewed straight-on from the rear, and the large, nearly oval tail-lamps which sit on the edge of the XUV 300’s haunches give it more character than the rather hatchback style rear of the Tivoli. LEDs signature brake lights and the dual tone rear fender add to the SUV flavour; as do the faux underbody protectors at the front and the rear. 
For ‘Mahindra sceptics’, the most pleasant surprise awaits in the cabin. The perceived quality of the XUV 300’s cabin is way above any of the other Mahindra vehicles that we have seen in the past, except may be the Alturas G4. There are a lot of near direct lifts from the Tivoli in the XUV 300, like the steering wheel, the centre stack with its array of controls for the dual-zone climate control and seat-belt warnings and the infotainment screen. The rest of the dashboard and centre console are a mix of original and borrowed bits. Fit and finish is excellent and the quality of plastic used is good, though not good enough to avoid windscreen glare. Also the choice of dark grey and creamy white colour theme for the cabin (in the top-trim) doesn’t help when the sun is beating down.








 
 




















 
The white leatherette seats, touch and feel quality of the control switches like the power windows and the overall dashboard layout make the XUV 300’s cabin feel like it is from a segment above. The leather-wrapped steering is great to hold and the controls mounted on are easy and intuitive to use. The 7-inch infotainment screen offers connectivity options like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. 








 
The XUV 300 also gets a lot of equipment that we generally don’t get in the sub-four-metre SUV segment - stuff like auto headlamps, rain-sensing wipers, heated and power folding door mirrors, height adjustable seat belts and a sunroof. Some safety features like ABS with EBD and corner braking control are standard fitment, which also means that disc brakes on all four wheels are standard. Some interesting combination of storage spaces for bottles and knick-knacks have been added. There is a lot of shoulder, head and leg room in the cabin for both front and rear bench occupants. 


















 
 
The boot space also seems lesser than the competition’s. Though, Mahindra officials didn’t confirm the exact rated volume, it looked to be sub-300litres. Trim variant strategy, as also a number of other elements in the spec data are also yet to be confirmed. My test mule wore the ‘W8’ badge indicating that it will be top-trim, with 7 airbags which too I think will be optional additions. 
The XUV 300 will be offered with one petrol and a diesel powertrain option. I was only offered the 1.5-litre Diesel engine with a 6-speed manual gearbox. At the drive, Mahindra officials evaded questions regarding the possibility of an automatic transmission. For now, at launch, the XUV 300 will have only manual trannies. The petrol engine is a 1.2-litre turbocharged unit that produces 110hp at 5,000rpm and 200Nm of torque at 2,000-3,500rpm. Featuring tech like variable valve timing and an exhaust manifold integrated with the cylinder head, make the petrol powertrain sound interesting, but unfortunately couldn’t be experienced.








 
The 1.5-litre diesel powertrain generates 115bhp at 3,750rpm and a segment-leading 300Nm of torque between 1,500 to 2,500rpm. There is some turbolag from the idling 800rpm to about 1,400rpm, once the turbo kicks in, the surge in power makes the XUV 300 feel quick and eager, though much of it is loaded in the mid-range. It doesn’t feel like a hulking, heavy SUV, but more like a nimble-footed large hatch. Creditable to note that the gearbox is also a clean shifting unit with fairly tall gears. I felt that the gear stick could have been a tad shorter to help with a better hold and shorter throw. The top-trim diesel powertrain variant I was driving also featured a start-stop micro-hybrid system and a few other features like hill-hold control, which I’m not sure would be offered in the lower trim variants. Overall, the diesel powertrain feels refined, linear in its power delivery and quick. No four-wheel drive option for the moment, though the Tivoli is offered with one in markets like the UK. Mileage numbers are yet to be confirmed, but I got over 12.5kmpl after a mix of aggressive highway and city driving in Goa.
The XUV300’s ride quality is impressive for a Mahindra. After being used to over-soft setups (including the Alturas G4), it is gratifying to see that this one has a fairly firm suspension set up. There is still body roll and a pliant bias at the rear. But, the stiffer set up also helps in improving the handling without much of the usual rear stepping out problem that we’ve seen in the other Mahindra SUVs. Credit must also go to the steering set up which interestingly is being offered with three modes - Comfort, Normal and Sport. The electronic power steering actually stiffens up in Sport mode, even at slower speeds, making it feel more precise and even with a bit of centre weight. 
Overall, the XUV 300 is quite a surprise package bearing the Mahindra badge. If priced right within the Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh range, the XUV 300 has the potential to shake up the competition in the segment."

Grand plans Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, Mahindra & Mahindra, poses with the new XUV300




Grand plans Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, Mahindra & Mahindra, poses with the new XUV300


Pawan Goenka lets you into a little secret about the recently launched XUV300. “This was the only product where we knew the name when we started work on it,” reveals the Managing Director of Mahindra & Mahindra. 
This is quite unusual, given that in all products, the name generally gets decided only three to six months prior to launch. Not so in the case of the XUV300 where the team knew what it was going to be called even two-and-a-half years ago when work on this compact SUV kicked off. 
What was also known was that it shared the platform of its successful predecessor, Tivoli, launched by M&M’s subsidiary, SsangYong Motor, in South Korea four years ago but this is where the similarity ended. 
The product for India was going to be part of the XUV family and, hence, designed with the cheetah in mind as was the case of the XUV500. It was not as the team decided to call it XUV300 without bothering to figure out what it would look like.
“We knew from the very beginning that this is what we were going to call this SUV and, looking back now, I think it was a very good decision,” says Goenka. This is because XUV has become a fairly strong brand that epitomises the premium segment in SUVs. An association with that brand name would, therefore, help XUV 300 “in a big way” as also the XUV500 in return. 
“So there is a freshness in the XUV family. People coming to see XUV300 will also look at XUV500. And some might decide that they have enough money to buy XUV500,” continues Goenka. In short, this strategy will hopefully be a win-win for both models.
The key here is that the two offerings have common traits, which justify their inclusion under the same XUV brand umbrella. As he explains, what set the XUV500 apart from the rest at the time of its launch in 2011 was its head-turning design apart from other USPs like its power, size and the slew of tech features within. 
All these features are present in the XUV300 too. “So, it is clearly a continuation of the XUV philosophy,” says Goenka. To that extent, this clearly gives the brand a certain unique positioning within the M&M product portfolio. Sure, the Scorpio still has a certain pride of place but can never have a sibling like a Mini/Max Scorpio for instance. On the other hand, the XUV500 can spawn a son, daughter or even a father going forward. At one point in time, speculation was rife that the Rexton G4 would be christened XUV700 for India but then this would not have worked since there was really nothing in common in the brand DNA that defines XUV. Hence, Alturas was seen as the more appropriate name for this offering.
However, as Goenka says, XUV300 is clearly part of the same family. It is also very special since it was the first product that was initiated after M&M’s takeover of SsangYong seven years ago. “I had the pleasure of approving the investment at that time and be involved in a little bit of its development,” reminiscences the M&M chief, who is also Chairman of SsangYong.
The Tivoli, which debuted earlier from this platform, has been a huge game-changer for SsangYong since the time it was launched in 2014. In the process, it was a rebirth of sorts for the beleaguered Korean auto-maker as much as the Scorpio was for M&M many years earlier.
“When we launched Scorpio then, we had no clue how it would be accepted. This was the same for Tivoli,” says Goenka. After all, this was a brand new product for a segment that did not exist in the first place. This only meant a greater challenge from the viewpoint of market acceptance, especially from a company like SsangYong, which was just about coming out of the woods.
“So there was a lot of anxiety when we launched Tivoli, and of course it took SsangYong to a different level,” recalls Goenka of a script that was pretty similar to M&M’s with the Scorpio way back in 2002. However, he adds, there was no such anxiety with the XUV300 and, instead, the team is brimming with confidence. 
This stems from the fact that this is a proven platform for four years running now. Tivoli has turned out to be a big success in Korea’s compact SUV segment and still going strong. “We were able to take that platform and do a lot more with it in order to make it right for India,” says Goenka. What was crystal clear during the development process was that if Tivoli had been replicated for India, it may not have succeeded since the design is not “SUV enough” for buyers here. “If we do not tailor the product according to the local customer’s tastes, it can never become a leading product,” he reiterates.
At best, a company can hope to sell a few hundred units but that is how much the product will go. “To make a leading product you have to, even if you bring the platform from outside, make it right for the end customer,” says Goenka .
The M&M team worked relentlessly to make the XUV300 a reality where a whole lot of Indian inputs were incorporated in the vehicle. “So having done all this, we went into the launch with a lot of confidence that this was a product that would at least turn the tide in terms of market share,” he adds. 
And while the confidence levels are high, Goenka sounds a note of caution on the big unknown that is characteristic of any market, especially India. “Nobody knows how a consumer will behave. There could be something that we think we have done very well but the customer may not want it at all,” he says. 
As he puts it, confidence should not be mixed with overconfidence where everyone is certain that the product will be a sure-shot success. “We know that we have a good product with good pricing but we still have to work as hard as we have done in the past to make it succeed. Confidence should never lead to overconfidence,” he says.
By the end of the day, the birth of XUV300 is an important chapter in the M&M-SsangYong journey where the partners have pulled out all the stops to ensure that the building blocks are in place. The M&M of today has different centres of excellence across the world ranging from MANA in Detroit, SsangYong in Korea and Pininfarina in Italy to Mahindra Research Valley in Chennai and the Design Studio in Kandivali, Mumbai.
All this translates into a big cerebral network within the Mahindra ecosystem, which needs to be leveraged optimally to meet future challenges. “If everything happens in one place by one set of people, you will not succeed,” says Goenka and this is where these five centres are more than doing their bit in keeping the momentum going.
It is this pooling of skills and competencies that has played a role in creating products like the XUV300, Marazzo, Alturas and even in the commercial vehicle space with the recently-launched Furio range. 
“We are now able to leverage the complete network that we have created for engineering and product development,” he adds.
Yet, the overriding criterion is that sourcing will be done in India since this is the only way costs can be kept in check. “If sourcing went all over the place, we will not be able to meet price expectations of customers,” says Goenka. 
This is what has helped keep prices of products like XUV300 and Marazzo at more realistic Indian levels. “And that is the beauty of being able to leverage all these networks for doing good engineering development, but still bring everything together in India so that we are able to manage price,” says Goenka.
As For SsangYong, the biggest priority right now is to launch the new Korando C300, which debuts in Korea soon. This is a brand new product that replaces Korando-C, which was launched during the time of the M&M acquisition in 2011.
The C300 is tipped to do good numbers and the target for SsangYong this calendar is to sell 1.6 lakh units, a 10 per cent jump from the preceding year. The other significant offering is the Tivoli refresh that will debut around the end of the third quarter. 
After all, the compact SUV has been around for over four years now and the time has come for a new look. “Again, next year we have new products coming out, so it's a fairly busy schedule,” says an upbeat Goenka."
22,2019-03-14,Mahindra Mahindra,"Filling the crucial gap to fuel India’s global drive
It is more than evident from his conversations that India is very close to Pawan Goenka’s heart.
Yet, for a country that is on its way to becoming the third-largest producer of cars in the world, there is still someway to go before it can truly reach the levels of Korea, Japan, Europe or the US.
Goenka does not believe this is an impossible task as the real task on hand is “to fill that small gap which still requires us to sometimes look outside of India to get everything done”. After all, a country like Korea does not look outside for its requirements right from presses, weld shops and tooling to engineering, prototyping and testing.
This is not so in India where presses and most high-end machine tools are sourced from elsewhere in the world. Hence, continues Goenka, the reasons for this gap will need to be carefully scrutinised. 
Clearly, it is not cost since India is amongst the lowest in this department globally. Neither is it in the mindset given that the desire to do things is still high.
While there are no clear answers to this quandary, it is perhaps scale that is the limiting factor. 
“This is certainly a possibility because, all said and done, how many vehicles get engineered in India? Very few,” responds Goenka. Beyond a handful of products from Tata Motors or M&M, everything else is by-and-large done outside. 
The worrying part is that for a potential superpower in the automobile space, the country still does not have the scale for new product development. 
Sure, there is a lot of sourcing that happens from here for overseas operations of multinationals but the bottomline is that India’s share of world auto component trade is minuscule. Clearly, there is something that is just not working in furthering its potential as an automotive export base. By the end of the day, India still has a long way to go before catching up in global trade of components with the likes of Korea and China.
It is a subject that is close to Goenka’s heart and he is confident that the future will bring better news for the country. It is also in this context that he hopes that the day will come when Indian automotive brands truly put their footprints overseas. 
As Goenka adds, 95 per cent of sales with the Mahindra brand still happen in India. This is perhaps true for Tata Motors too, which means little headway has been made in taking Indian auto brands global.
“What is it that is lacking that does not allow us to do that? We need to fill that gap. And I am sure that what is lacking is not huge, it’s only small… but that small is the most difficult,” he says. 
The M&M chief is waiting for the day when India truly comes of age in automotive brands globally. “Even if somebody else does it, I will feel good. If we at M&M do it, I will obviously feel elated,” declares Goenka."
23,2019-03-14,Mahindra Mahindra,"M&M chief dwells on the challenges ahead of BS VI
With barely a fortnight to go before the fiscal draws to a close, Pawan Goenka will have reasons to feel pleased. There has been a spate of key product launches across segments and the mojo is positively back within his company’s ecosystem.
Yet, the Managing Director of Mahindra & Mahindra is only too aware that there are bigger challenges ahead. “Next fiscal is clearly where all hands are on BS VI,” he says. The reference is to the new set of emission norms, Bharat Stage VI, which become mandatory across the country from April 2020. 
Effectively, it means that there is barely a year to go before this becomes a reality except that it is not going to be a walk in the park for any auto-maker in the country. From M&M’s point of view, elaborates Goenka, there are about 30 models that need to transit to BS VI and each of them is a “good-sized project”.
Clearly, the top focus is to manage this exercise effectively in the next 12 months. There will be no new product launches during this period since it simply does not make any sense to have something new on the table now in the last lap of BS IV. It is only after BS VI that the company will start its fresh cycle of launches.
Goenka is also aware that there is a lot of work ahead for his team, which will literally have to work 24x7. “There is tremendous work that is going on which people outside do not realise,” he says. The workforce at Mahindra Research Valley in Chennai is literally burning the midnight oil to keep pace with the deadline.
After all, this is an all-new technology arena that they are getting into and it is not as if time is on their side. After all, India has decided to leapfrog directly from BS IV to BS VI in a timeframe of just three years, something that has never been attempted elsewhere in the world. 
Goenka points out that the challenge is not confined to auto-makers alone but their ancillary suppliers too who are “equally busy” since it marks an even more formidable frontier for them in terms of making a different set of components.
In the process, what they have for the existing BS IV line may have to be just abolished when the BS VI line is commissioned. 
“Everybody talks about OEMs and what they are doing but people don’t realise that the effort is actually happening at suppliers’ end,” he says. This comprises the fraternity that makes exhaust systems, the engine, converters, control systems, etc.
All this is also an expensive exercise since new technology does not come cheap. Goenka admits that there is a “big unknown” in terms of how customers will react to the significant increase in price of the new BS VI products. Clearly, it is impossible for manufacturers to absorb these high costs, which will have to be passed on, not the easiest of tasks in a price sensitive market like India.
There are bigger challenges that need to be addressed. For instance, during the run up to BS VI, some of the new emission-compliant products will have to start being readied sometime in mid-January 2020. “So, it means we will be ramping up BS VI and ramping down BS IV,” says Goenka. This simply means that both both BS IV and BS VI products will be jointly manufactured for two to three months.
This is not going to be a simple task by any stretch of imagination. Companies will have little idea of how many BS IV vehicles they need to make because it will be be a tall order to forecast demand till March 31, 2020. “If I overestimate demand, I will have unsold vehicles that I can do nothing with,” says Goenka. Even one unsold vehicle could translate into 2000 kg of junk “because it will have no value”. 
Likewise, manufacturers cannot afford to underestimate demand because they will then be left with BS VI vehicles idling in their plants for want of the right fuel. “So, even if I have BS VI vehicles sitting in my plant, I cannot sell them,” he says. 
The only way out of this tangle is to ensure that the cleaner fuel is available pan-India and just not in a handful of places. Manufacturers have requested the Centre to let them know by September 30 “that there is a 100 per cent guarantee” of fuel availability. This will help ensure that there is no last minute change that could potentially jeopardise their plans.
As Goenka explains, the transition from BS III to BS IV cost money for sure but was not as complex as the present leap to BS VI, which is a totally different technology and design. “It is not upgrading as in the case of BS III to BS IV. This is a case of throwing out BS IV and making BS VI,” he says.
The concern, therefore, lies in being able to manage the transition so that “neither do I underestimate the demand for BS IV nor do I overestimate it and be left with stocks”. Yet, in this grim backdrop, Goenka is confident thanks to the calibre of people within the Mahindra ecosystem.
Those at MRV have been working around the clock and are especially upbeat now because of the recent launches in the SUV space, with the latest being the XUV300. 
“Given that we have done three launches, I am sure that many people in MRV are deprived of sleep. That doesn’t stop them,” he says proudly. 
In Goenka’s view, these employees feel a certain level of attachment on the lines of ‘It’s mine and not somebody else’s… I am not doing it for someone else. I am doing it for myself’. It is this pride that keeps them going even if it means long levels of insomnia.
“This is the feeling that I think keeps us in a situation that, in spite of all the gaps that we may have anywhere, we are able to kind of always overcome any sort of constraints or roadblocks that come up,” says Goenka. 
As he puts it, this goes beyond the engineering team to the people at M&M who work with suppliers or set up and operate plants. 
There is a lot that goes on behind the scenes that many in the world outside cannot truly fathom. 
“It is sometimes very easy to criticise something that did not come out right but I wish people knew what kind of effort goes into it. I mean, 200-300 people working for four years… that is 1200 man-years of effort,” says Goenka. No wonder that he is betting big on his colleagues at M&M to stand up to the BS VI challenge."
21,2019-04-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"Ford set to reboot India innings with M&M as ally
Ford and Mahindra & Mahindra are preparing to jointly draft a new blueprint for India going by what Reuters reported earlier this week.
This will see the formation of a joint venture where M&M will hold the majority 51 per cent stake. If the script goes according to plan, the existing assets of Ford will be transferred to this new partnership. Issues on valuation, retail plans and so on will perhaps be articulated in the coming months as Ford attempts to reboot its India innings through this new business model.
Neither company has confirmed this development, though, on the face of it, it seems an extremely pragmatic option. It is no secret that Ford has little to show for its two decades in India even while there were some successful products along the way. In the case of M&M, having a strong global brand means access to greater competencies and also building scale beyond its present numbers.
Can this be interpreted as a partial exit of Ford from India? Can this be compared to General Motors, which has pretty much shut shop for all practical reasons. Not quite, considering that Ford will still be around, though in tandem with an ally with whom it had first joined hands in the mid-1990s before the two decided to part ways some years later. 
At that point in time, two decades earlier, this was the norm for almost all Indian companies that teamed up with big global players but eventually called it quits for a host of reasons. This included Tata Motors (with Mercedes-Benz), Premier Auto (Peugeot and Fiat) and Hindustan Motors (Mitsubishi and General Motors, but now back with Groupe PSA).
M&M and Ford teamed up to manufacture the Escort from the former’s Nashik facility. This was largely an assembly operation before the American auto-maker decided to set up its own greenfield plant near Chennai. By this time, M&M had decided to focus on SUVs as its core business and this was the beginning of Project Scorpio leading on to a remarkable growth story.
Ford had reasons to feel buoyant about India considering that the Escort had made a reasonable impact as a brand. The market was not as overcrowded then as it is now with just a handful of other players. One of them, Peugeot, had already exited, and Ford was getting ready on its next big project in the form of the Ikon mid-size sedan.
The market liked what it saw though it was also pretty clear by this time that competition was intensifying with more players entering the Indian automobile arena. Asian brands like Hyundai, Toyota and Honda had made their intent known, which meant that Ford had its work cut out.
The other significant difference, nearly two decades earlier, was that Detroit was still the monarch of the automotive world. Brands like Ford and GM may not have had any compelling reason to pull out all the stops for new regions like India where the returns were slow in coming. 
After all, they were making good money from their traditional markets in the US and Europe. India, on the other hand, was still difficult by virtue of its price-sensitivity and the massive tilt towards compact cars. Given this backdrop, it was quite natural for these big American brands to take it easy with their India plans especially when the market was still in a stage of evolution.
However, companies like Hyundai were quick to figure out what it took to crack the India code. The stakes were also a lot higher and the Korean car-maker made sure that it never took its foot off the pedal since the time it launched the successful Santro compact car.
Hyundai, to its credit, has also grown strongly since then to emerge a formidable global brand. Along with its group company, Kia (which is getting ready to launch its debut SUV in India), the Korean duo has admirably balanced the needs of developed and emerging markets. The same cannot be said of brands from Europe, the US and even Japan (barring Suzuki), which have constantly found the Indian market a struggle in terms of costing.
It was during this time that Daewoo went bankrupt even while it valiantly strove to keep its operations here afloat. As other global auto-makers queued up to buy it, Ford emerged the highest bidder with $6.9 billion. Just when it looked as if it was set to take over the beleaguered Korean brand, it dropped out perhaps realising that the price was just not worth its while.
How would the script have turned out for India had Ford actually bought out Daewoo? Given that it turned out to be the best thing that happened to GM, which eventually acquired the company, there is every reason to believe that Ford could have just managed to scale up its India presence. All credit to GM, though, for optimising the competencies of Daewoo and growing its presence in Europe and other parts of the world.
Interestingly, Ford had explored the option of a powertrain alliance with Fiat for India clearly with an eye on pooling competencies in a market that was still growing. Nothing came out of this but, as in the case of the ‘what if’ premise with Daewoo, the Fiat tie-up may have also thrown up some intriguing dynamics.
It was also quite apparent by now that India was essentially a two-horse market comprising Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai even while other brands like City (from Honda) and Qualis/Innova (Toyota) were creating an impact in addition to those from Indian companies. Ford made news with product launches but was not perceived to be a serious threat.
It was in 2008, when the Lehman crisis happened and all hell broke loose, did the honeymoon in Detroit come to an abrupt end. Ford emerged relatively better from the bloodbath than GM and Chrysler but it was crystal clear that tough days lay ahead. By this time, it had decided to trim its global brand portfolio, which saw Jaguar Land Rover change ownership to Tata Motors.
Under the leadership of Alan Mulally, the company got ready with its ‘One Ford’ strategy, which meant a greater sense of platform synergies across markets. The idea was to keep investments in check while leveraging the competencies of various automotive manufacturing hubs worldwide and meeting the needs of individual markets. 
During one of his visits, Mulally had reiterated to this writer that India would be a key part of this strategy. “India is important to us because the vehicles we make like the Figos, the Fiestas or small SUVs are the centre of the market worldwide. That is why you see us making such a focussed investment in balancing our portfolio to have an increasing number of smaller and medium-size vehicles,” said the President and CEO of Ford. 
By the end of the day, smaller vehicles accounted for nearly 60 per cent of worldwide requirement and it was this large chunk that would be part of Ford’s global platforms. Here, 70-80 per cent of the components would be exactly the same across the chain. 
“We will actually make vehicles in the same way across the world. A Fiesta in Chennai will be made exactly the same way as in China or the US, which gives us the scale with our suppliers and [helps us] bring more affordable products (than competition) to customers,” said Mulally.
One Ford strategy worked to plan but there were a new set of mobility challenges now emerging across the world. Mulally decided to retire in 2014 and his successor, Mark Fields, a Ford veteran, was around for just three years before Jim Hackett took over. 
As is true for other auto-makers, there are enormous challenges ahead in a world now dominated by priorities like autonomous driving, electric mobility, ownership disruptions thanks to options like Uber, etc. There are big investments to be made and Ford is therefore looking at alliances to leverage opportunities while keeping costs in check.
This explains the move to join hands with Volkswagen for new initiatives as well as with M&M in India. The company has also cut back on its Russia operations while China will continue to be an important market. It cannot ignore India for its obvious potential even though costing will remain a challenge in the years to come. What better than to team up with a known ally and work jointly to meet future challenges?
The details of the alliance will, hopefully, be made public soon. At one level, the move could be seen as a downsizing by Ford in terms of autonomy but this is far more practical than bidding adieu. This is what GM did two years ago when it decided to stop selling cars in India but still has one plant operational for export markets. How long that will continue is the million dollar question."
20,2019-04-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"For M&M, alliance with Ford marks new growth phase
Mahindra & Mahindra will play a pivotal role in the partnership with Ford, at least going by the fact that it will be the larger shareholder with 51 per cent stake.
For now, there has been no official confirmation coming in from the companies but Reuters has stated that this is likely to happen in the next 90 days. The two had already decided to team up for initiatives in the electric mobility space as well as new platforms two years ago but the joint venture will take the bonding to the next level.
For M&M, this will mean a massive evolution from the time it first teamed up with Ford in the mid-1990s to keep pace with other Indian companies who were throwing their hats into the glamorous automobile arena. M&M was, in fact, tipped to partner Chrysler initially for the Cherokee but opted for Ford in a dramatic turn of events.
The partnership lasted a few years by which time M&M had prioritised the SUV space as its focus area. It had already kicked off work on Project Scorpio which was destined to change the face of the company and take it to new heights.
Yet, the company did not take too long before it re-entered cars, this time for a 51:49 joint venture with Renault to make the Logan at its Nashik facility. A lot was expected from the entry-level sedan and, at one point, it seemed as if the partners were planning bigger things with an all-new facility in Chennai along with Nissan.
While the Logan did not deliver to potential, M&M also steered clear of the Chennai project, which ended up being the first global manufacturing footprint for Renault-Nissan. The Logan alliance came to an end and M&M brought back the vehicle in its new avatar as the Verito. It was also around this time that SsangYong Motors was in the hunt for a new owner and this is when M&M made a successful bid. There was a lot of hard work ahead in turning the company around but the efforts have paid off now. Today, M&M and SsangYong have been collaborating on platforms and the latest effort of this bonding is the recently launched XUV300.
The Indian SUV-maker has also bought out Pininfarina, the Italian car design firm, while setting up a footprint in North America with MANA (Mahindra Automotive North America). The integration of teams has helped in the creation of products like Marazzo with perhaps more in the pipeline. Ford will be another big step forward for M&M since there are a host of challenges emerging in the mobility landscape. Joint efforts will help cut costs while the frugal engineering competencies built in India will be a win-win for the partners.
Scale is paramount to both Ford and M&M. It will be interesting to see how the alliance evolves going forward. Will the two continue to jointly pool in skills or look at the option of buying out the other’s stake eventually? These are unpredictable times for the auto industry but the harsh reality is that it’s better to join hands rather than fight it out alone."
19,2019-04-28,Mahindra Mahindra,"Ready for electric vehicles? 
 
The auto sector has been in the thick of action in recent times, with worries over pollution and the need to switch over to electric vehicles (EVs) over the next decade, occupying the centre-stage. With the country taking steps towards establishing the eco system for EVs, it has become imperative for vehicle manufacturers to come up with their plans and for auto component makers to redraw theirs, to suit the new order. How are auto-makers placed to usher in this revolution? And, if you have listed auto and auto component stocks, are your holdings EV-proof?
Moves such as the ban on diesel/petrol vehicles over 10/15 years old from entering NCR, the Supreme Court’s decision to not extend the time line for adoption of BS IV standard fuel across the country and the government’s decision to jump directly to BS VI emission norms by 2020, show that India is getting more and more serious about curbing vehicle pollution.
The most ambitious of all the measures is the plan to switch over to electric vehicles by 2030. A paper titled “India Leaps Ahead: Transformative Mobility Solutions for all” put out by the Niti Aayog (the nodal agency for the EV move) in May 2017 lays out a roadmap to 2030. It bats for 100 per cent electrification of three-wheelers, four-wheeler (commercial) and public transport vehicles, while aiming for 40 per cent electrification in two-wheelers and four-wheelers used for personal transport.
According to the report, if the above mix is achieved, India’s emissions are expected to decline by 37 per cent by 2030. Similarly, energy requirement for transport will come down 64 per cent from what will be required if the current scenario continues until 2030.
 










 
The government has taken this vision forward in Phase II of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid&) Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme which provides demand incentives for EV purchases from April 1, 2019.
Since the costs of EVs tend to be high, demand incentives ranging from ₹20,000 per vehicle for buyers of e-two wheelers to ₹50 lakh per vehicle for e-bus buyers over a period of three fiscal years (initially) is being provided to bring down the end price to customers.
FAME II is in sync with the government’s goal of 100 per cent electrification of public transport by 2030, as it predominantly encourages only electric technology and in that, only lithium ion battery or other newer technology battery-based vehicles; besides, e-buses and e-three-wheelers hog more than half the allocations under FAME, batting for environment-friendly mass transport system. FAME apart, concessional GST rates of 12 per cent is already being provided for EVs to bring down the cost for customers. Conventional fuel vehicles now attract GST rates of 28-50 per cent. Tariffs on imported parts of EVs have also been reduced.
To enable manufacturers lower the production cost, state governments are coming out with various incentives for locating manufacturing units in their States — Karnataka Maharashtra and Uttarakhand are examples. State government policies also provide support for setting up charging infrastructure as well as concessions through various means for customers.
 








 
 
Considering that a wide network of public-charging infrastructure is the very backbone of any mass shift to EVs, the Ministry of Power has been taking various measures to set up charging infrastructure through public sector undertakings such as NTPC. Guidelines and standards for setting up such infrastructure were put out by the Ministry in December 2018. A charging station at every 25 km on both sides of roads/highways is mandated. A phased roll out over the next five years is envisaged.
Besides, to popularise EVs, the Centre has started procuring electric cars for government use through Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), while various state governments have put out their own electrification/procurement targets over the next few years under their respective EV policies.
Thus, the ecosystem is slowly, but surely, growing roots. Seen in the light of lowering lithium-ion battery costs over the last few years and the fact that ISRO has indigenously developed lithium-ion battery technology, these moves indicate that mass production and mass adoption of EVs could indeed be a reality by 2030. Given this scenario, auto makers are leaving no stone unturned to jump on to the EV bandwagon.
Among listed auto players, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is in a comfortable position, being one of the earliest entrants into the EV space through the acquisition of Reva Electric in 2010. Today, the company has come a long way, offering a range of EVs across cars (E2O Plus, eVerito ), three-wheelers (e-ALFA, Treo) and small goods vehicles ( eSupro).
 








 
 
Besides, it will also unveil the electric version of its popular compact SUV KUV 100 in mid-2019. M&M is among the companies supplying EVs for government use through EESL, with an initial order for about 4,800 eVeritos (costing ₹10-15 lakh)
FAME II’s preference for cars used in fleet operations will further benefit the company as M&M has already been partnering with Ola, Zoomcar and Meru for fleet operations. Having entered the fray quite early, the company is now on its second leg of expansion in the EV space. Towards this, it has invested an initial ₹500 crore at its Chakan plant under the new EV policy of the Maharashtra Government. In the second phase of expansion, the company will further ramp up manufacturing and charging infrastructure, develop new, high-end electric powertrains as well as battery technology. Electric mobility is also an area where Mahindra is working in partnership with Ford Motors to develop new products, platforms and other solutions.
Tata Motors is not far behind, having launched its electric bus and electric version of the Tigor passenger car. The buses are currently being sold to government transport undertakings in West Bengal, Jammu, Jaipur, Lucknow, Indore and Guwahati. Though private sale of the e-Tigor has not yet commenced, like M&M, the company is supplying 5050 e-Tigors to EESL (costing ₹10-15 lakh) for government use. Electric versions of small trucks/commercial passenger vehicles such as the Super Ace, Magic Iris and Magic have also been showcased. Thanks to the EV wave across the globe, Tata Motors also has Jaguar Land Rover to lean on for technology support. The all electric Jaguar I-PACE has gone on sale recently. JLR has also announced that all its launches from 2020 will be electrified.
Other listed players — Maruti Suzuki and Ashok Leyland — have taken the partnership route to developing EVs. Throwing its hat in the ring only after the announcement of the government’s 2030 deadline, Maruti Suzuki’s EVs will be co-developed by the global partnership between Toyota and parent company Suzuki, leveraging on the former’s strength in electrification technology and the latter’s strength in making compact vehicles. The company’s first EV is expected to be launched in 2020. Suzuki is also setting up a lithium ion battery plant at about ₹1,100 crore in Gujarat in a joint venture with Toshiba and Denso.
Ashok Leyland already has access to EV technology through its UK-based subsidiary Optare. Last September, the company set up an electric mobility centre in its Ennore plant with facilities for engineering, prototyping and testing for motors, battery modules and packs. This apart, the company has tied up with several organisations (predominantly start-ups) to further its EV inroads in areas such as battery, range extenders and power electronics. For instance, it has joined Sun Mobility, which specialises in smart batteries and quick recharge stations.
Ashok recently introduced the Circuit S e-bus, powered by battery technology from Sun. About 50 of these will be supplied to Ahmedabad Janmarg for intra-city transport. An electric version of its smaller commercial vehicles is also on the cards.
Eicher Motors too has launched its electric buses and is working with its partner Volvo, on a range of public transport options.
Electric two-wheelers have been leading the EV market so far, accounting for over 90 per cent of the country’s EV sales. But the scene is currently dominated by unlisted players. Listed players such as Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto have their tasks thus cut out for meeting the 2030 deadline.
To fast track its EV plunge, Hero MotoCorp has invested in Ather Energy — an IIT-Madras incubated start-up — and has also set up its R&D facility for electric mobility in Jaipur. Ather brought out two e-scooters — the 340 and 450 — in 2018 priced at over ₹1 lakh.
For TVS, the Creon e-scooter is on the cards. While it has also show-cased an electric three-wheeler concept, it is working with another start-up Ultraviolette Automotive for developing premium two-wheelers. Bajaj Auto’s e-scooter — Urbanite — will debut this year. It is also launching e-three-wheelers. Eventually, its Qute quadricycle may also offer an electric option.
Thus, all major listed players are doubling their efforts in a race to meet the government’s 2030 deadline. But despite the incentives, affordability will be an important factor for mass adoption of EVs — be it for personal or commercial use. Making frugal, but reliable, vehicles will be the challenge for the Indian market.
Maruti Suzuki, TVS Motors, Bajaj Auto and Hero Moto Corp — companies focusing on the price-sensitive segments such as commuter bikes and compact cars — will be more vulnerable here. Higher localisation and economies of scale, along with lower battery prices, are key to bringing down the costs. Stiff competition from the large number of unlisted auto makers in India such as Hyundai and Honda — which have a sizeable market share and are also developing EVs with equal enthusiasm — will be a threat to all listed players.
Overall, an interesting decade lies ahead for auto stocks. From being an old economy sector in the last decade or more, the space will be in the spotlight once again over the next ten years. Investors need to keep a close watch on company-specific developments in the EV front, as it may define the prospects for stocks from now on.
With EVs all set to revolutionise the auto industry, it becomes imperative for auto component makers to chalk out their strategies for supplying parts to EVs. The key difference in the EV regime will be the replacement of the internal combustion (IC) engine, transmission and drivetrain parts with batteries, motors and other electronic components. Hence, suppliers of parts such as cylinder blocks/heads, pistons, valves, shafts, fuel injection, clutches, axles, gears, radiators, coolants and lubricants will be impacted. Many companies have begun drawing up their EV strategies to counter this risk of obsolescence.
Global auto component major Bosch, a supplier of fuel injection systems to IC engines worldwide, is gearing to meet this challenge both in India and abroad. The company has developed an integrated electrification system, including motor, control unit, battery and charger that can power two-, three- and four-wheelers.
Bharat Forge, which supplies powertrain parts, is also developing products for EVs. It has set up an EV R&D centre in the UK and has picked up stake in Tork Motorcycles, a drivetrain company focused on electric two-wheelers. It has also invested in Tevva Motors (Jersey), a company that provides electric powertrain solutions to commercial vehicles. Mahindra CIE, another powertrain supplier, is also working with global and Indian clients on their EV portfolio.
With the government focusing on electrifying buses, three-wheelers, two-wheelers and cars initially, companies which supply to trucks are shielded from the move to EVs. Clutch-maker Setco Automotive and steering gear supplier ZF Steering, for instance, supply predominantly to trucks, although they earn some portion of revenues from other vehicle segments. Suspension product-maker Jamna Auto Industries, lighting suppliers Lumax Industries and FIEM Industries, makers of shock absorbers such as Gabriel India and Munjal Showa, and tyre makers are other players that are not impacted negatively by EVs in a big way. Wiring harness-makers such as Motherson Sumi will be impacted positively, as EVs are expected to have higher wiring content per car.
But listed lead-acid battery makers such as Exide and Amara Raja Batteries are in the direct line of fire. But they are taking steps to reinvent themselves to suit the lithium ion battery regime that EVs demand. Exide has tied-up with Lechlance SA based in Switzerland to build these batteries for Indian EVs and is setting up a plant in Gujarat.
Though Amara Raja Batteries had announced the setting up of an assembly plant for lithium ion batteries, the recent termination of its relationship with technology partner Johnson Controls is a worry. Plans of auto manufacturers to set up their own battery plants of EVs also heightens the competition for these two players."

Plant shutdowns have become rather routine for automakers, with sales plummeting by the day and no signs of a reprieve in sight.
The first two months of this fiscal have seen sales in free-fall mode. Market leader Maruti Suzuki is reportedly contemplating cutting back on production in the coming weeks. Mahindra & Mahindra has already made its intent known in a communique saying it will go in for a closure of up to 13 days this quarter.
If the slowdown continues, more names could join the list. This is because companies will really have no reason to produce cars/two-wheelers and contribute to inventory pileups at dealerships.
Industry captains are hoping the Budget will bring in some positive news which could draw customers back to showrooms. For now, lending by NBFCs has virtually dried up, which means even interested buyers can’t access loans.








 
Automakers will be hoping that the GST on vehicles is brought down to 18 per cent from the existing 28 per cent, while the Centre will also do its bit to inject liquidity back into the system.
Manufacturers, meantime, are grappling with the pressure of material costs while working round the clock to get ready for the Bharat Stage VI (BS VI) emission norms, which kick off in April 2020.
The slowdown has caught the industry by surprise though it was getting apparent some months ago that demand in urban markets was drying up. This was reflected in falling sales though there was still some optimism that things would soon be back on track.
This was based on the assumption that there would be brisk buying of BS IV products which would be far more affordable than the BS VI options. After all, there are some pretty significant investments going into technology fitments for BS VI vehicles. This will translate into all vehicles becoming dearer.
It was this reality which possibly caused automakers to assume that this fiscal would see buoyant sales of the less expensive BS IV offerings.
The slowdown has caught everyone off-guard and manufacturers are now pretty much resigned to things not looking up till the end of the second quarter.
In the process, the supporting ecosystem, comprising ancillary suppliers and dealers, are also facing the pressure, especially when it means coughing up for overheads like labour costs and rentals. It’s hardly any surprise that dealerships are closing down while tier 2/3 suppliers are walking the tightrope between cutting back on BS IV production and investing in new lines for BS VI.
“It is a nightmare and we can only hope that there is some light at the end of the tunnel,” a supplier told BusinessLine. It’s only logical that following plant closures by their vehicle customers, vendors will also follow suit.
If a long slowdown occurs, things could get really tricky. “We don’t think this will happen and are hopeful that things will look up from October. We are already factoring slow sales for the April-June 2020 quarter, when customers will be lukewarm to expensive BS VI options,” said an industry official."
16,2019-07-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"M&M pushes the envelope seeking new farm solutions 


Rajesh Jejurikar, President (Farm Equipment Sector), Mahindra & Mahindra

Rajesh Jejurikar, President (Farm Equipment Sector), Mahindra & Mahindra
   -  --


The Gamaya website tells you that this four-year start-up based in Switzerland ‘addresses the need to increase efficiency and sustainability of large industrial farming, as well as the productivity and scalability of small-holder farming’.
This is done by deploying the ‘world’s most advanced solution’ for mapping and diagnostics of farmland. It is in this Swiss company that Mahindra & Mahindra acquired a 11.25 per cent stake a month ago. What was the reasoning behind this move? There is a lot of background to it as Rajesh Jejurikar, President (Farm Equipment Sector) of M&M, reveals.
The Gamaya story is part of the transformational journey that the Indian tractor maker kicked off nearly four years ago. The objective then was to try and make a difference in the way farming was done. Till that point in time, M&M was in a happy space as the market leader in tractors.
Yet, its top management was aware that “the size of the pond outside” was huge in terms of the global machinery place. This is what spurred the move to acquire companies and create big footprints in Japan, Finland and Turkey.
“Now let me add on a couple of layers to that. One, as we look at globalising, there is a sharper understanding of who our customer should be. And that is the small landholding farmer who we want to target in India and globally,” explains Jejurikar.
M&M, he says, is keen on bringing to this community the technologies that are otherwise deployed on larger farms. “So, when you think about wanting to do this, in a way you are transforming yourself across the spectrum saying I am a specialised tractor player and want to move from here to being a more holistic mechanisation solution,” elaborates Jejurikar.
This is where the tractor-plus-other machinery piece comes into play in checking if the company can move the business to go beyond machines and influencing outcomes. For instance, how it can impact productivity, cost or yields of farmers in a more definitive way at a global level in its priority markets.
These include Turkey, North America, Mexico, Brazil, Africa and South Asia which fit in with what M&M is looking for in terms of small landholding farmers. Essentially, this is also how it strives to be different from other manufacturers. “This is the background with which I am connecting Gamaya and the whole aspect of precision farming as we call it,” says Jejurikar. This involves capturing images of soil and crop on farms using a combination of hyper spectra cameras, satellite images or drones. The data gathered creates algorithms that can start predicting crop infestation and the like.
“Or you could be doing some work on soil and what are the nutrient levels in different parts of your land, what is going to need fertilisation and what is not,” says Jejurikar. Basically, this boils down to creating maps of crop or/and soil data which can help improve output or bring down costs by preventing losses.
Alternatively, the use of crop care or other chemicals in the soil can be optimised by letting it go where it is needed and not overdoing it. “Overdoing is not only cost but it is also bad for the soil. So, when you look at the whole ecosystem, how are you going to create these solutions which are different for different crops? Every crop type that you pick needs a different approach,” says Jejurikar.
Prior to Gamaya, M&M had invested in a Canadian company, Resson Aerospace, for similar objectives. “Think of these as technology innovation centres where you are making small investments with small equity. They allow you to build a technology skill set in the process,” he explains.
In a way, this is akin to the concept of open source innovation where the idea is to use the ecosystem of technological capability to help a company achieve its business objective. This, according to Jejurikar, is a far better option than doing it in-house which is “never going to be easy” in addition to the fact that “you are never going to be able to hire that kind of talent”.
The better way forward is to work with a global start-up ecosystem which is doing cutting edge work and then use that “to adapt to what is the outcome that we want”. In the case of M&M, this essentially means making these technologies relevant to small landholdings by ensuring that they are both affordable and accessible.
“It is a long-term play and will not give you anything tomorrow. It is all part of the process of building capabilities,” says Jejurikar. This vision fits in with M&M’s concept of ‘Farming as a Service’ or FaaS.
Here, the endeavour is to influence outcomes of farmers in India by going beyond selling tractors/mechanisation to helping out with the crop type or soil in a hyperlocal situation. Just to put this in context, sugarcane in Uttar Pradesh is different from Maharashtra as also paddy.
“Hence, it is just not about selling tractors but what else can be done to help farmers maximise (productivity),” says Jejurikar. This is where FaaS comes into play with different options to create specific solutions for India’s vast landscape.
Obviously, it is still too early for a company like M&M to influence “every crop in every part” of the country but at least the journey has begun in right earnest. In a way, says Jejurikar, it is a combination of digitisation and on-ground presence that need to come together to make this work.
By the end of the day, everything is happening on that plot of land accompanied by the inherent risks that go with the story. “It is a very hyperlocal solution that is being offered to the farmer. That map is for his soil/land and the factors that influence it,” he says.
From M&M’s point of view, investing in a company like Gamaya helps because it is already working with a host of global customers. Back home in India, M&M has already got some of its own solutions in place for small landholding farmers.
Beyond India, the company is also looking at Turkey, where it has built a significant presence on ground, as well as Brazil “to think around these solutions”. How about the ASEAN region? Jejurikar says this may not work since it needs to link with the overall strategy.
For instance, it will not be easy doing something like this in Thailand since M&M does not have a presence here. The key is to to connect this strategy with the rest of the overall business strategy. “So, going into a market for this will not give you scale and you need the on-ground presence,” he explains.
Turkey is a different ballgame and a much easier option in contrast, given that M&M has in its kitty the No 3 tractor brand in the country, Erkunt, as well as an agri machinery business through Hisarlar. “We can leverage both and we have the distribution network in place to contemplate a value-addition,’ says Jejurikar.
During the last three years, M&M has made some significant acquisitions in Japan (Mitsubishi Agricultural Machinery), Finland (Sampo Rosenlew) and Turkey (Hisarlar). The three streams of product portfolio that have been created as a result represent individual centres of excellence.
“We are very happy with our progress on building our technology skills,” says Jejurikar. Work is underway on building “a very large” product portfolio of farm machinery products from Hisarlar, some of which will come to India. Likewise, there is a lot happening on developing a harvester product portfolio.
The strategy is clearly focussed on the word where the different beachheads in Japan, Turkey and Finland will meet the needs of a host of markets. There is also a lot of learning taking place within the Indian teams on cultural sensitivity in dealing with Turkey, Japan, the US and so on.
At one point in time, M&M was exploring the option of re-entering China but that plan has now been put on hold. “We said we would evaluate China but do not have a viable business case to enter the market,” says Jejurikar. For now, the company has its hands full with the Americas, Turkey, Japan, East Europe, Africa, South Asia and so on. The constant push for new ideas in farming stems from the fact that food needs to be available in the decades ahead. Most of the population explosion that happened in the last 20-30 years managed to satiate their requirements by increasing cultivable land. On the other hand, food needs over the next 20-30 years will become more challenging as there is not enough arable land available.
“Many of these things are critical to increase productivity and food availability. If you estimate food requirement, it will have to come out of productivity,” says Jejurikar. Water, of course, is the next big thing and, eventually, conservation will be mankind’s top priority going forward."

After warning of job losses and reporting a 26 per cent dip in its quarterly profits, the Mahindra Group said on Friday it will shut down production at its plants across the country for 8-14 days in the second quarter.
This comes a day after India’a largest commercial vehicle firm Tata Motors Ltd announced a three-day block closure at its plants in Pimpri (Pune) and Jamshedpur.
In a notification to the stock exchanges, M&M said: “The company... as part of aligning its production with sales requirements, would be observing ‘No Production Days’ ranging between 8 -14 days in various plants of the company and MVML (Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd) during the second quarter.”
M&M also said the move is not likely to impact the availability of its vehicles in the market since there are adequate stocks.
The company, on Wednesday, had cautioned of job losses owing to the ongoing slowdown in the auto industry even as it reported a 26 per cent decline in Q1 FY20 profit to ₹918 crore, against ₹1,238 crore in the previous-year period. Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, had remarked that the automobile industry was going through one of its worst slowdowns in recent times.
The slowdown beleaguering the auto industry has been a prolonged one. Passenger car sales have plummeted every month over the past year, with October 2018 being the sole exception.
This June, four out of the six main passenger vehicle makers registered a double-digit fall in sales. Insufficient liquidity, higher rejection rate in financing and overall negative consumer sentiment have cast a shadow on spending.
Mahindra said the plant shutdowns are meant to align its production with sales requirements"

Tractor volumes are witnessing positive growth in August 2019, driven by better customer sentiment on improvement in monsoon and Kharif sowing. This compares with a steep decline of 14 per cent over April-July 2019.
Our channel checks in the States of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, and Bihar indicate an improvement in customer inquiries and volumes. Many of these States have witnessed a steep decline in volumes in earlier months.
Customer sentiment has been supported by improvement in monsoon and Kharif sowing. Monsoon stands at a surplus of 1 per cent as of August 14, 2019, while Kharif sowing has increased to 93 million hectares (marginally lower than the long-term average levels) as of August 16.
New tractor registrations on the Vahan platform, which collects data from Regional Transport Offices across the country, also indicate that demand conditions have notably improved in August 2019, compared with July 2019. Cumulative registrations in 12 States have witnessed 11 per cent y-o-y growth in August 2019 (up to August 15), versus a decline of 9 per cent y-o-y in July 2019.

Mahindra & Mahindra’s Managing Director, Pawan Goenka, reiterates that slowdowns are an inevitable part of business. The Indian auto sector is experiencing one right now and the M&M chief believes that the ‘bad times’ never last forever. Goenka spoke to the media during the recent inaugural of the company’s KUV100 assembly plant in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Excerpts:
Last year’s festival season was a washout for auto sales. How do you view the prospects in the upcoming one? 
I was at our tractor dealers meet recently and had the opportunity to interact with many of them. Our dealers appeared to be fairly positive on the festive season. The rains were delayed but now it has arrived and the farmers are beginning to look at buying tractors. 
They believe that though the floods have been quite bad in some areas, it will not have a huge impact on tractor sales. From the interaction with our dealers, I am confident that we will get a 6-8 per cent growth in the next eight months, which means flat to 2 per cent growth for the year. Clearly, the positive sentiment in the tractor industry will rub off on the rural segment of auto industry. 
There is a slowdown in new vehicle sales while the used car space is growing. Shared mobility is also gaining ground. Is this the new normal for the auto industry?
There are three reasons being floated on the causes for the slowdown: One, the rise of shared mobility; two, the impact of electric vehicles (EVs); and three, the impending switchover to BS VI emission norms. While I think that these factors will affect sales in future, they are not the right reasons for the ongoing slowdown. 
Why do I say that? It is because EV volumes even today for four-wheelers is only 300 to 400 units a month, when we are selling 2.5 lakh internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles a month. And, I have not come across anyone who is eagerly waiting for EVs so much so that they are postponing buying an ICE vehicle because of this. 
As far as shared mobility is concerned, if you look at the growth, it has somewhat flattened. I am not seeing too many vehicles going into this space and even so, the total number sold for shared mobility by the industry will still be a small percentage of the whole demand. 
We believe what shared mobility is doing in India unlike other developed countries is that it is making mobility more accessible and not necessarily replacing a personal car ownership. Those who own cars may choose to use a cab hailing service for some inconvenience but that doesn’t mean they would not want to have personal cars. 
Finally, it is not that customers do not want to buy BS IV vehicles fearing the arrival of BS VI. It is the usually the other way round as they will pre-buy since they don’t want to pay a higher price. 
There are reports of shutdowns and job losses across the auto industry. How is M&M managing the slowdown? 
This is the fourth time in my career that we have had this slowdown. The previous occasions were in 2001-02, 2008-09, 2013-14 and now in 2019-20. I have always said that one should not do anything major or ad hoc in a time like this. If you do it, you are mortgaging your future. The bad times never last and if you are not preparing for the good times in terms of capacity and product, then you will not be able to leverage them (when they happen). 
One thing which we always do in any slowdown — and we are doing it again this time — is that we never slow down on any product development or capex that is required for bringing the right product for the customers. I have also said in the past that a slowdown is a good time to cut down the flab, which we are doing in terms of reviewing our spends. 
As far as workforce goes, from April 1 until now, we have probably removed about 1,500 temporary workers. We are trying not to remove more. But the concern on job losses will not be so much from OEMs. It will be more from suppliers and dealers as they cannot afford to hold on to them.
What kind of support is the auto industry expecting from the Centre?
First, there are three reasons for the slowdown. The first is the tightness in financing, both wholesale and retail financing. The second is the rise in transaction cost of vehicles, and the third is sentiment. 
The government can certainly give some push to NBFCs, PSU and private banks to see how better financing can be made available to dealers and customers. For lifting the overall sentiment, there is no magic wand. That will happen only when the economy looks up. 
The transaction cost has to come down. It has increased in the last two-three years for a variety of reasons including commodity prices that had gone up for two years in a row fairly heavily. This apart, rise in registration cost, road taxes, insurance becoming long-term and regulations have also impacted the transaction cost. 
GST rate reduction is one route the government can take. But instead of the GST rate, the cess can also be changed. If the government does not want loss of revenue, it could tinker with non-revenue items like insurance going back to one year, thereby bringing down the premiums. 
The one per cent TCS is not a revenue item but it also can be eliminated as it is a transaction cost to the buyer (even though it gets refunded later). There have been some increase in road taxes. States need to relook on whether it is justified. And, the registration fee is likely to go up again. This should be avoided.
Is the industry fully prepared for the BS VI move on April 1,2020? 
The first question is whether the auto industry will be ready with BS VI on time. While we may have the vehicles, we have to do a lot of work managing the inventory, slowing down on BS IV vehicles and ramping up BS VI vehicles. But technical challenges seem to have been met. 
The second question is fuel availability, which is a concern. While it has been committed that fuel will be available from April 1 next year, it is not good enough. If we have to sell only BS VI vehicles from April 1, we have to start selling sooner than that. We can’t be selling BS IV until March 31 and shift to BS VI on April 1. So we need fuel before April 1. SIAM is talking to the Oil Ministry on this. 
The third concern is pricing. The cost impact is lower than what we thought it would be. But that doesn’t mean it is insignificant. Yes, there will be a shock for a while. But our hope is that it will slowly settle down. In summary, I don’t want you to think that it will not have an impact on demand. It will!

11,2019-09-12,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra introduces subscription-based vehicle service for retail buyers 


After having introduced a leasing model for its retail buyers last year, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd on Thursday announced the introduction of a subscription-based initiative, in partnership with Revv–a self-driving rental platform–for its retail customers, in a bid to offer a different usage model, which doesn’t necessarily involve ownership. 
This initiative will attract a whole new set of customers to brand Mahindra, said Veejay Ram Nakra, Chief of Sales and Marketing, Automotive Division, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. It also aligns with M&M's larger vision of transforming the face of mobility in India, he added.
“With the changing era, (and) the millennials wanting to experience brands in different ways with avoiding long-term commitments - both in terms of time as well as and financial capital - we believe that it’s an appropriate time to look at convenience, flexibility and affordability as the three key pillars to drive ownership experience. A subscription model is something that, in a sense, addresses all these three needs of today,” Nakra told reporters in an interaction post the announcement. 
He added that it’s not just the millennials, but also the self-employed, expatriates and mobile working forces who now seek flexibility in terms of owning high value assets like automobiles. 
The subscription model will be available on Mahindra’s personal portfolio of vehicles, namely – KUV100, XUV500, XUV300, Scorpio, TUV300, Marazzo and Alturas G4. It will be available for a period of one to fouryears in the case of a new car. 
“I don’t think this is a short-term intervention for a short-term slowdown in the automobile industry. There are structural shifts that are happening and in an environment of structural shifts, we need to have a robust strategy of offerings and this is something we have been working on for a long time. It’s just that from the timing of launch point of view, it seems to happen where it is right now.” said Nakra, to a question on whether this initiative was rolled out keeping in mind the current prolonged slowdown in the automobile industry.
Hyundai India had also partnered with Revv in March to provide its cars to customers on a subscription basis. 
Mahindra’s subscription offer will cater to working professionals and SMEs and will be available across eight Indian cities including Delhi (NCR), Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Ahmedabad in the first phase. It plans to cater to 11 more cities in the next three months, said Nakra.
Mahindra’s offer begins at a subscription price starting from ₹19,720 per month (which can vary according to the model), inclusive of insurance and routine maintenance charges.
The benefits of subscription to the customers include complete convenience, zero down payments, no road tax, zero risk on the resale value of the vehicle, and a fixed amount that includes routine maintenance cost, the company said. 
Nakra said, one has the flexibility to change the vehicle model after a certain minimum subscription period, and this flexibility to upgrade their models from time to time is what primarily differentiates it from a leasing model. Unlike the leasing model, it also allows customers to opt for a minimum of one year, as opposed to the 3-4 years that a leasing model necessitates.
Once the subscription period is over, the person can return the vehicle to the company without selling it, and get a new vehicle. Or they have the option of owning it, by buying it from the company at a pre-determined charge."
10,2019-09-25,Mahindra Mahindra,"Recent policy changes present an opportunity to reset the economy: Sachidanand Shukla 


Sachidanand Shukla, Chief Economist, Mahindra & Mahindra




Sachidanand Shukla, Chief Economist, Mahindra & Mahindra


 
Sachidanand Shukla, Chief Economist, Mahindra & Mahindra is of the view that global central banks have limited ammunition left. India is dealing with unprecedented economic paradoxes, and is effectively accommodating them in an ‘age of discontinutity’, he says. 
In an interview with BusinessLine, Shukla explains how the recent tax cuts and challenges to business model may fuel the engine of growth. 
How does recent tax cut impact India’s global position as a business destination and government finances?
The recent corporate tax cuts definitely place India at par with nations having the lowest corporate tax in the region, as well as, the world. However, we must note that corporate tax rate is just one of the variables that induces businesses and investments. There are other factors such as future prospects, policy certainty, ‘ease of doing business’ and rule of law etc., which have a major bearing on the final investment decision.
Prima facie the mixed reaction of capital markets gives us important cues. While equities rejoiced, bonds sulked, given the impact of these tax cuts on the government’s borrowing programme.
As for fiscal deficit itself, the impact is not ‘simply proportional’. Let me explain: the near-term impact of lower tax rate will be smaller than is being assumed. As Prof. Ajay Shah explained recently, when tax rate is cut the distortion in the economy comes down, spurring growth. Concomitantly, efforts made by people to evade taxes also goes down. 
By the same token, when tax rate is raised, tax revenues in the near-term rarely meet expectations. 
Thus, to summarise, while the jury is out, if the tax cuts manage to “buy” investment growth overtime, the fiscal impact will be mitigated.
Will a reduction of tax on individuals spur demand?
Let us be clear that this tax rate is aimed at incentivising investments over consumption, as it leaves more money behind in corporate pockets. In the current scenario, there is also a clear lack of demand, which this move doesn’t address directly.
In the recent past, we have seen two distinct phases in the economy. First, money was transferred into farmer pockets through loan waivers by states and through direct cash transfers schemes by both states and the Centre through PM Kisan. 
Next, we have now seen money being left behind for corporates through tax cuts. Given the state of demand deficiency and the fact that nominal incomes have either stagnated or have been rising anaemically, it is about time the government looks at money being transferred to the tax payer through lower, flat income tax rates, sans any exemptions. 
The new Direct Tax Code will most probably give that recommendation. However, note the finances of the government can’t absorb such a transfer currently, and hence may be next fiscal year when government revenues and GDP growth stabilise, we will see this move from the government, which could alleviate the demand side challenges.
How have the recent reforms affected the economy?
India, certainly, has seen a policy reset with big economic policy disruptions of late, and that too in quick succession, and a short period of time. Demonitisation, GST, RERA, IBC, MPC, accounting standard changes, Direct Cash Transfers — each one of these are hugely disruptive. One of the key challenges of our times is to accommodate paradoxes. For ages we have been housed simple problems that entailed simple solutions. But not any more. To quote Peter Drucker: “We are in the Age of Discontinuity”.
While these policies have disrupted the economy and cost us growth and jobs in the short term, they also present an opportunity to reset the economy at a different yet higher plane. This will require changes to business models, policy tweaks etc., but it will help us reach a higher sustainable growth path. 
For example, IBC has taught India to “fight fire with fire”. It will free up entrepreneurial energy and capital, which will seed the next investment wave. GST, once it stabilises and teething issues are ironed out, will help raise tax/GDP for the government, volumes for companies and lower tax incidence for consumers.
Global banks are yet again moving towards QE. Your view on inflation and bull run in gold?
The key challenge for the developed world has been lack of inflation. This is despite a stimulative decade post the Lehman crisis, with almost $15 trillion worth of cumulative QE. 
Yet, barring US, where growth and employment moved up over the last few years, there is hardly any solace elsewhere. We haven't seen GDP growth, exports, consumption or investment/GDP ratio moving ahead of the past decade averages.
Globally, there still exists huge overcapacity across sectors in terms of manufacturing and services. China is the mother of this overcapacity built-up, especially in manufacturing (and hoarding of commodities). Hence, the fresh wave of quantitative easing (boosting liquidity into financial system) should be inflationary. 
But a point also to be noted is, now global central banks have limited ammunition (tools of monetary policy) compared to in the past, and on the demand side, the appetite will still be lower than what we saw during the last cycle of easing. 
Therefore, while inflation will go up initially and so will the price of gold as a hedge, but the upside for both is likely to be limited due to the above factors."
9,2019-10-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"Why is Ford Motors exiting India
BL Research Bureau
Close on the heels of General Motors leaving India, Ford Motor Company too is transferring its India operations to a joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) . M&M will hold the controlling stake of 51 per cent in the new entity, while Ford Motors will hold 49 per cent.
Although Ford had an early start after the Indian market opened up to foreign carmakers, it could never make any meaningful contribution. 
As of 2018-19, the company’s volume market share in the passenger vehicles segment stands at just 2.75 per cent and it still sells under one lakh vehicles a year. In contrast, Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai together hold about two-thirds of the market share. 
Despite stiff competition, Maruti’s market share has strengthened over the years. It stands at 51 per cent as of 2018-19. It was around 40 per cent a decade ago. 
Ford had two big successes in terms of its product portfolio which could have helped the company move up the pecking order. One was the Figo, which was introduced in early 2010. Ford’s market share in 2010-11 inched up to 3.9 per cent that year, thanks to this launch. 
The second was the Ecosport, which created a new sub-segment in utility vehicles called the ‘compact UV’ segment. However, stiff competition from launches such as the Duster (Renault), Vitara Brezza (Maruti Suzuki) and Creta (Hyundai) had its impact on the EcoSport too.
However, the silver lining is that unlike General Motors, which has completely exited the Indian market, Ford’s joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra will help continuity of the Ford brand in India. 
The joint venture will develop, market and distribute Ford brand vehicles in India. To begin with, the joint venture expects to introduce three new utility vehicles under the Ford brand, starting with a new mid-size sports utility vehicle. 
It is noteworthy M&M has already been in an alliance with Ford since September 2017 to work on and develop various products/ solutions for the auto market."

Anand Mahindra, Chairman, Mahindra Group
   -  PTI




Anand Mahindra, Chairman, Mahindra Group
   -  PTI


Anand Mahindra barely has time to answer a couple of questions.
The Chairman of the Mahindra Group has just wrapped up a press conference in Mumbai to announce a joint venture with Ford. The two companies have worked in the past and are now back together in a far more significant alliance targeted for India and a host of emerging markets.
Mahindra is in a rush but pauses to listen intently to the question posed on the journey his company has been through in the car space over the years, including the alliance with Renault a decade earlier.
“It has been an interesting journey (with Ford, Renault and now Ford). However, the question is that every time you do a joint venture, as I said back in the early 1990s, there is a logic for doing so,” the Mahindra Group Chairman tells this writer.
As he puts it, the logic has to be some benefit “that you derive” and once those benefits are derived, each party has to be very clear about what they are looking for. “Everything we have done, we have had very clear objectives,” he reiterates. For instance, when Ford first entered India over two decades earlier, it was essentially about familiarising itself with a market that had just thrown its gates open to multinationals. For Mahindra & Mahindra, on the other hand, it was about upgrading technology where Ford was the ideal ally.
With Renault, it was about the French carmaker coming into India and getting the feel of a new market while for M&M it was about accessing the Logan which still continues in its new avatar as the Verito. The partnership did not last very long but, as in the case of Ford the first time around, there was a huge learning experience for the Indian SUV maker.
“Joint ventures are the recipe of the day to compete in a much more complex automotive world,” says Mahindra on the rationale of coming once again with Ford. He also points out that it is not as if it is only his company that is forging partnerships since this is now the norm worldwide.
“So what better partnership to have than one with an old friend?” reasons Mahindra as he gets ready to drive away. In the mid-1990s, M&M tied up with Ford in a 50:50 partnership to manufacture the Escort at its Nashik plant. By the time the American automaker had decided to get into full-fledged manufacturing at a new facility in Chennai, M&M was now determined to focus on its core business of SUVs.
This was the beginning of Project Scorpio, the vehicle that paved the way for a completely new path for M&M as it grew from strength to strength. On the way, it acquired SsangYong Motor of South Korea while in more recent times, it has had to take on fiercer competition in the SUV arena back home.
In the case of Ford, it tasted success with the Ikon but could not quite sustain the momentum in later years. There was a global buyout opportunity for Daewoo which subsequently went to General Motors while a powertrain joint initiative was explored with Fiat in India.
All in all, Ford had little to show in its two decades here in terms of market share and has now teamed up with its former ally in a new joint venture with a 49 per cent equity share. Things are clearly a lot more different now, reiterates Pawan Goenka, Managing Director of M&M, at a media round table.
“At that time, the JV was more for Ford to learn India and for M&M to learn automotive manufacturing of modern times. This time, the alliance is to grow the business together,” he says. It is a view seconded by Jim Farley, President of Ford New Businesses, who is also part of the round table discussion.
“This is about maturing; the original objective in 1995 was totally different and it was the early days of the modern India automotive industry,” he says. As each company’s ambitions grew, it became clear that the best way to execute that was on its own.
“Now, the market has changed again and emerging markets are becoming so important for us at Ford,” continues Farley. In his view, the marriage this time around with M&M has a different objective which is to “develop new products, use M&M’s incredible capabilities that they have built since our last JV and now to benefit from that being together both in India and overseas”.
Between the two companies, says Goenka, they have six plants spread across Nashik, Haridwar, Kandivali (Mumbai), Chakan, Chennai and Sanand (the last two are Ford’s). For now, only Chakan and Sanand have extra capacity which means either can be used for future products/platforms “wherever it makes sense”.
Goenka also makes clear that while there will be huge synergies at the back end in terms of sourcing, R&D, engineering etc, the two companies will keep their brand identities intact at the front end of retail and distribution. This is where their individual DNA becomes the differentiator.
Interestingly, Alan Mulally who was the President & CEO of Ford till 2014 and played a huge role in its turnaround had implemented the One Ford strategy which was intended to prune the number of global platforms and increase commonality of components.
“We learnt a lot from One Ford and I mean a lot,” emphasises Farley. The team at Ford understood that that the scale had to be local to get value. If the product attributes were ‘over attributed’ with global, and not local, scale, things could not quite work from the viewpoint of value creation.
This, according to Farley, was a very important lesson for Ford as it went about the plan and redesigned its business. “We will have a fusion of a new capability below that which is a local scale and that is really the opportunity we have with M&M,” he says.
The other opportunity, which again was “a good part” of One Ford was learning how to export from India. “If you go to anyone who owns an EcoSport in Western Europe, Germany or Chicago, they love the product,” says Farley while driving the point home of global competencies developed locally. It is testimony to the quality of India and there are no two ways about the fact that this product is truly world-class. “We believe that this was an important positive lesson from One Ford. Now we get to do it with a cost base that we have never had before (with M&M),” says Farley.
During his tenure as President & CEO of Ford, Alan Mulally had told this writer in a 2012 interview that India was important to the company since the products made here like the “Figos, Fiestas or small SUVs” were the centre of the market worldwide. “That is why you see us making such a focused investment in balancing our portfolio to have an increasing number of smaller and medium-size vehicles,” he said.
Mulally added that smaller vehicles accounted for nearly 60 per cent of worldwide requirements and would be part of Ford’s global platforms. Here, 70-80 per cent of the components would be exactly the same across the chain.
“We will actually make vehicles in the same way across the world. A Fiesta in Chennai will be made exactly the same way as in China or the US which gives us the scale with our suppliers and [helps us] bring more affordable products (than competition) to customers,” said Mulally.
Today, the alliance with M&M is happening at a time when mobility disruption is the name of the game and has prompted a host of companies to forge partnerships and take the challenges head-on. Ford has also teamed up with Volkswagen for commercial vehicles and, more recently, has drafted a new course of action for China with Changan Automobile. For emerging markets, the path will be defined along with M&M and it will be interesting to see how the script evolves in the coming years."
6,2019-10-06,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra & Mahindra Stock Call: Is the worst over?
The Mahindra & Mahindra stock is a good bet for investors with a long-term perspective. Though automobile sales are now stuck in first gear and may take some time to pick up, the company’s focus on utility vehicles (UVs) — which is gaining a larger share of the passenger vehicles pie — will stand the company in good stead once the tide turns. Signs of a turnaround in tractor sales are visible in the last one or two months. This bodes well for the company, which derives about 35 per cent of its standalone revenues from tractor sales.
The slowdown in the industry has beaten down the stock by almost 30 per cent since our earlier ‘buy’ call in end-December 2018. The fall may be an opportune time to accumulate the stock. At the current price, the stock trades at an attractive valuation of 14 times its trailing 12-month standalone earnings. This is much lower than the three-year historical average valuation of 28 times.
New vehicle sales growth, which slowed to 5.15 per cent in 2018-19, dropped sharply by15.9 per cent in the first five months of this fiscal. The latest September sales too have not been any better. Though the government announced various stimulus measures to boost auto sales, the much-expected GST rate cut hasn’t happened.
Given the attractive discounts, good monsoon and the festival season, demand may improve across rural and urban India to an extent. The benefit of lower corporate taxes for some companies may be passed on to consumers in the form of price cuts that can help improve sales. Cheaper loans could also help convert fence-sitters into buyers. Yet, the proposed transition to BS-VI emission norms on April 1, 2020 could be a dampener to sales this year. However, given that the industry is perhaps near the bottom of the cyclical downturn, sales could begin looking up from FY21. M&M is a good bet on this expected revival.
Structurally, the Indian auto buyer is gravitating towards bigger cars and UVs. UVs constituted 27 per cent of the total passenger vehicles sold in 2018-19, up from about 12 per cent in 2010-11. The share of UVs has increased further in the first six months of this fiscal. The focus on UVs is M&M’s strength. It has spruced up its UV portfolio through launches such as Marazzo and Alturas G4 in the mid- and premium segments.
The XUV 300 in the highly competitive compact segment was launched towards the end of the last fiscal. Since it has a predominantly diesel portfolio at a time when BS-VI emission norms would make diesel engines relatively more expensive for smaller UVs, the company is working on having only petrol options on smaller UVs such as the KUV 100 under BS-VI.
M&M expects demand for the petrol version of the XUV300 to go up after the BS-VI norms kick in. The latest JV with Ford will help the company derive synergies in component sourcing, product development and manufacturing over the long term, thereby saving on costs. The JV’s initial focus will be UVs. Three jointly-developed UVs are in the pipeline.
 
While tractor sales have been nothing to write home about so far, the worst seems to be over. Sales fell between 8 and 19 per cent in each of the first five months of this fiscal. But the company was able to arrest this fall and record a flat growth in September 2019. In the months to come, the low base of last year (volumes for the company fell 4.2 per cent in the second half of the last fiscal, against 17.9 per cent growth in the first half) will help. Besides, the bountiful rains and good outlook for the upcoming rabi crop season bode well for tractor sales. M&M is the market leader in tractors with 43.3 per cent share at the end of the June 2019 quarter.
Weak volumes resulted in lacklustre numbers for the company in the June 2019 quarter. During the quarter, auto segment volumes fell by 6 per cent, while those of farm equipment, by a sharper 14.5 per cent.
As a result, M&M’s standalone revenue from operations dropped 4.4 per cent to ₹12,923 crore, while profits (excluding exceptional items) fell 22.4 per cent to ₹947 crore.
Operating margins too shrank to 15 per cent from 15.7 per cent a year ago."
5,2019-10-22,Mahindra Mahindra,"Here’s how automakers are gearing up for the BS-6 transition 


From offering huge discounts aimed at bringing down the inventory levels of BS-4 vehicles to creating awareness among consumers on the benefits of new technology, automakers are pulling all stops to ensure that they are ready to roll out BS-6 vehicles come April 1, 2020. 
Contrary to the previous transition in emission norms from BS-3 to BS-4, wherein automakers were caught napping and had to liquidate their stock within a matter of a few days before the deadline, this time, automakers are not only better positioned to make the transition to BS-6 norms well within the stipulated deadline, but are also not expecting a fire sale of the BS-4 models.
BusinessLine spoke to automakers to understand how they are gearing up for this transition to BS-6 norms, which has also been identified by most automakers as one of the major reasons for the subdued customer demand in the face of one of the worst slowdowns to beleaguer the automotive industry in recent times.
Back in 2017, just a few days before the deadline for the transition to BS-4 norms, the Supreme Court banned the sale and registration of BS-3 vehicles, leaving automakers staring at a stock of around 8.2 lakh BS-3 vehicles, as it was earlier understood that they will just have to cease the manufacture of new BS-3 vehicles post the deadline, and that they can sell their existing BS-3 stock even after the BS-4 deadline.
In line with the BS-6 transition, Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest carmaker, introduced its first BS-6 compliant model in April 2019, and has already sold 2 lakh BS-6 compliant petrol vehicles, with eight of its 16 models being BS-6 compliant now. It has already stopped production of BS-4 cars for these eight models in which BS-6 models have been introduced, said Shashank Srivastava, Executive Director, Marketing & Sales, Maruti Suzuki India Limited. For the rest of the models, the decision to cease BS-4 production will be taken keeping in mind the inventory levels, he added.
Srivastava said that Maruti has a “very balanced inventory” of BS-4 vehicles and that it doesn’t seem like there will be a fire sale.
“The current discounts are at an all-time high and we don’t think it will go beyond this level. Also, the production plan of most of the companies are aligned to BS-6 implementation and soon the BS-4 stocks will finish without prompting any fire sale.” affirmed Rajesh Goel, Senior Vice President & Director, Sales and Marketing, Honda Cars India.
Suraj Ghosh, Principal Analyst, Powertrain & Compliance Forecasts, IHS Markit, said that most OEMs would be clearing their inventories by February or March, and that there wouldn’t be a fire sale in its actual sense. “If there’s ever a sales period with heavy discounts, then it’s going to be this quarter, particularly the last month,” he added.
Ashish Modani, Vice-President and Co-Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA, also said that the discounts are already high and that the likelihood of any fire sale – which is almost non-existent – will be specific to a particular OEM or dealership. From an industry point of view, the industry is much prepared this time, compared to the BS-3 to BS-4 transition, he said.
In order to boost consumer sentiments at a time like this, Maruti has undertaken efforts like promotional offers of up to 1 lakh, price cuts to share the benefit from the corporate tax cut, easier finance availability by approaching banks for attractive finance schemes and an enhanced reach in sales and services through the launch of Mobile NEXA Terminal.
Honda Cars is also providing offers under ‘The Great Honda Fest’, which is helping it maintain sales of its BS-4 vehicles, said Goel. Honda Cars has also tied up with multiple banks and financial institutions to offer upto 100 percent on-road financing, low EMI packages and long-tenure loans to make the purchase process more attractive. “We are confident about clearing our BS-4 stock well in time before BS-6 implementation...We will do a sequential changeover to BS-6 from Q4 of FY19-20,” said Goel.
Additionally, taking into consideration the apprehensions beleaguering customers post the announcement about the discontinuation of smaller diesel vehicles, Maruti has rolled out a 5-year, 1-lakh km warranty on its four diesel powered cars, namely Dzire, S-Cross, Swift and Vitara Brezza. Customers’ confusion about the continuance of Vitara Brezza and S-Cross – which are currently available in diesel only – made them hold back their purchases, and Maruti plans to introduce petrol variants of these two models in the coming months, said Srivastava.
Goel said that the market has definitely moved towards petrol in many segments and that Honda Cars will also be aligning its production mix in line with the market demand. Honda Cars is planning to continue with its diesel models post the BS-6 implementation, he added.
In order to salve customers’ apprehensions about the BS-6 transition, Srivastava said that Maruti has also created extensive training modules for its front line teams and dealer sales executives on doubts related to the transition, as they are the ones interacting with customers on a day-to-day basis.
Hyundai, on the other hand, is offering petrol BS-6 engines with its Grand i10 NIOS and New 2017 ELANTRA. “We will be fully ready before the BS-6 implementation from April 2020...We have optimum levels of inventory for BS-4 and BS-6 cars,” said Puneet Anand, Sr. GM & Group Head - Marketing, Hyundai Motor India. It has also rolled out a Mega Festival Campaign, offering “smart deals on wheels, big benefits and assured early deliveries” on some of its brands in a bid to boost sentiments during the festive season.
At Toyota Kirloskar Motors Ltd, in the light of its challenges with Innova and Fortuner where the price hike is going to be severe post the transition, and is currently being discussed at Toyota, the company is trying to educate customers about the price hike and provide them with solutions in both BS-4 and BS-6, as per their needs, to help them make an informed decision, said N. Raja, Deputy Managing Director, TKM.
“Toyota production is based on a ‘pull system’ which helps us regulate how much is required by when and how, thereby regulating production basis the market demand. Therefore, we would monitor such elements so as to ensure no BS-4 vehicle stock beyond March 31, 2020,” said Raja.
Raja added that since customer preferences will vary depending on whether the purchase is made for personal or fleet use, and price forms an important aspect for fleet customers, the company’s biggest challenge will be to predict such customer-specific demand accurately.
At Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, it is taking efforts to educate customers on the BS-6 technology, said a Mahindra spokesperson. “All our marketing efforts will be to promote our differentiated value proposition of clean emissions and fuel efficiency with thrilling performance of our vehicles,” the spokesperson stated, adding that currently, it is up to the customers to take advantage of the existing price levels which are inclusive of festive offers to buy BS-4 diesel vehicles.
“At Mahindra, we are planning a smooth transition, with a ramp-down for BS-4 and ramp-up of BS-6 in such a way that the overlap will be minimal. In case of rare overlaps, customers will have the option to choose between BS-4 and BS-6 vehicles and will get price benefits on BS-4 vehicles. Since we cannot switch overnight from selling BS-4 to BS-6, we will start selling BS-6 vehicles and tone down BS-4 vehicles in a phased manner. For BS-6 diesel vehicles, availability of BS-6 fuel is crucial,” the spokesperson added.
A Volkswagen spokesperson said that the company is currently evaluating the market and is aligned with the Indian government’s vision. “Volkswagen carlines will be compliant well within the time period. To this effect, our on-ground sales and service consultants are well-trained to provide required advice and support to our customers,” the spokesperson said.
Honda Cars’ Goel said that from a customer’s perspective, it is the best time now to make a car purchase since the discounts are at an “all-time high”.
“The same car in BS-6 version will be more expensive and without these discounts. Even if one considers the resale value of a BS-6 car versus a BS-4 car, the current upfront discounts on buying cars now make the total cost of ownership more favourable for BS-4 cars,” said Goel.
Any undue confusion among customers about the viability of BS-4 vehicles has also been clarified by the government when it reiterated that all BS-4 vehicles registered till March 31, 2020 will continue to be operational for the entire period of registration, and this also means that there should not be any hesitance in buying BS-4 vehicles, Goel pointed out.
The demand is better than what it was a few months back because customers have understood that this is the best time to buy cars, added Goel. Since the festive period is ongoing now, it remains to be seen how the demand progresses in later months, he said."

2,2019-11-21,Mahindra Mahindra,"M&M, Ford gear up for emerging markets play

There are a whole lot of contours to the partnership between Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Ford but at the core lies the intent to create a foundation for what could become an “emerging market strong business centre”. 
According to Pawan Goenka, Managing Director of M&M, this is perhaps among the most important components of the alliance which needs to be understood in its entirety. It was also the starting point for talks between the two former allies. 
From Ford’s point of view, it was only too aware that it had a strong emerging market presence worldwide but it was M&M that had the business model for this to work well. The most logical step, therefore, was to take Ford’s global presence and M&M’s proven business model for emerging markets to create a strong union. 
In the process, this would then create tremendous value where the partners could even conceive of becoming emerging market experts through this association/alignment. “And that in a sense is a longer term vision of what we can do together,” says Goenka. 
He is candid enough to admit that while Ford’s technical knowledge, expertise and resources are ahead of what M&M has in its kitty, what the Indian SUV maker brings to the table is the all-important component of frugal processes. The combination of these strengths would have the potential to create “the most appropriate” products for emerging markets. 
“For instance, if M&M is able to do today, on its own, a good value product at 95-96 per cent of what the customer wants and, with Ford’s help, if this can go to 99-100 per cent, that is the gap that we fill there in the product,” elaborates Goenka. 
The net result is “a very strong product” for global markets where neither partner will attempt to overshadow the other. In the process, both the Mahindra and Ford brands will stay strong and independent without any threat of dilution. “So, if they are two different companies, two different brands, how does it help? That’s the question that has been asked of me,” says Goenka. The starting point to this query lies in product development which goes beyond the partners’ strengths of technical expertise and frugal engineering.
In the area of developing new platforms, for instance, where each partner would have to earmark a certain investment for this effort, doing it jointly would see the creation of one platform. This would spawn a vehicle each for M&M and Ford with savings of up to 33 per in product development. 
“Now, imagine if the cost is to the tune of ₹1,200-1,500 crore, the one-third savings would work out to ₹400-500 crore just in doing that one product,” explains Goenka. Whether it is a product for Ford or M&M, the benefits of using the same platform and plant (be it at either company’s facility) becomes an additional advantage.
The partners have also reiterated that this joint effort will just not be about changing the grille and putting a badge on it but working on a totally differentiated product. “Nobody would know, by looking at the product, that it is coming from the same platform,” he adds.
This means that the exclusive DNA of a Mahindra and Ford product would be intact which means the look, feel and drive would also be completely different and easy identifiable in the process.
Beyond product development, the combined strengths in sourcing will be substantial too and lead to significant cost savings. Even a 1-1.5 per cent reduction in material costs “is worth its weight in gold” since it will mean a “humongous increase” in profits.
As Goenka adds, M&M will also get access to the global sourcing world of Ford. Right now, this is primarily confined to India while Ford is truly global. “When it comes to what we source in India, we have very good expertise, probably among the best here, but when it comes to global sourcing, our expertise is very limited,” he explains.
The access to Ford’s plants, along with M&M’s own capacity, means that “for the next foreseeable future” there is no investment needed for capacity creation. Right now, Ford has 40 per cent available (it has two plants in Chennai and Sanand) while M&M, after the expansion in Chakan, would be at about 60-65 per cent capacity. In short, this means about 35 per cent capacity that is already paid for. “Therefore, our potential in the future, to not have to invest in capacity and still grow, is very high. So we are, in some sense, well-prepared for a market turnaround,” says Goenka. In his view, this is a clear positive since it means being “protected for a long time” in terms of capacity.
With these combined strengths at the backend, the M&M chief is confident that the stage will then be set for the global reach that the partnership has outlined as its core objective. “M&M has good emerging market products, but we do not have a reach, and to create a reach is not as easy as those who are not in the business would think,” he says. 
To create a dealer network, brand awareness and the ecosystem for warehousing, spares etc “takes a lot of effort and many, many years”. This is especially evident in a market like South Africa where, even after decades, M&M has managed to establish a “fairly decent network, brand awareness, and so on”. 
With Ford, however, the timeframe would not be so long and, in fact, result in getting “almost instant access” to many markets. “So therefore, using Ford for growing Mahindra volumes and selling (Mahindra) products through the Ford brand both become a very strong future potential,” says Goenka.
For instance, take a hypothetical instance of Marazzo where M&M, on its own, may target overseas shipments of around 500 units a month. If a Ford version of Marazzo ends up becoming a good MPV for emerging markets under the Ford brand, shipping out 5,000-odd units is actually conceivable. This optimism is bone out by the fact that Ford’s exports of the Figo to Europe are in a similar range as also the EcoSport to the US. 
 “So that is the kind of potential we see in growing exports through Ford, which benefits both Ford and Mahindra. The Ford network gets a product at a competitive price that they don’t have today,” says Goenka while citing the Marazzo as just an example of the potential that lies ahead. 
In turn, M&M gets the volumes for a product that they have developed, which means the company’s fixed cost comes down on a much larger volume. “Any of our products which we have today and what we will have in the future has the potential,” he adds.
In the process, there will be three “distinct things” happening in the emerging markets strategy. The first, begins Goenka, is the new product developed in the JV, for the Ford brand, exported under the Ford brand to the Ford network. 
The second is Mahindra products exported as Mahindra products in emerging markets with the Ford network helping out. And the third is a Mahindra product getting exported, with a change in appearance, as a Ford product in the Ford network globally.
Needless to say, continues Goenka, both companies need to constantly monitor trends in emerging markets to decide the price points, technology and so on. 
“This is where Ford’s technical base and Mahindra’s frugal approach will come together and give us the muscle power to compete with very aggressive players,” declares the M&M chief."

 Pawan Goenka makes no bones about the fact that partnerships are inevitable in today’s rapidly changing automotive landscape.
“From Mahindra’s side, as we look at the automotive business overall globally, it’s becoming very clear that even large players find it difficult to remain small scale,” says the Managing Director of M&M. 
And if small scale is defined as selling nearly three million vehicles, it is a no-brainer that a company like M&M would need an ally. 
“If we ever think that we can do without it, we are being foolhardy. One has to accept that in the emerging scenario, all players need partnerships,” says Goenka. 
As he reasons, this is a global business by the end of the day. Even if a company does not export a single vehicle, it is still in a global arena since it is competing with MNCs in India. “It does matter whether you are selling in one, two, five countries or 30 countries… alliances are a must,” he reiterates.
There are a whole lot of examples already mushrooming across the world. Toyota and Suzuki have joined hands for India and other emerging markets while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Groupe PSA have decided to merge. Ford, incidentally, has also teamed up with Volkswagen for pickups and electric mobility in Europe. In Goenka’s view, there could not have been a better cultural fit for M&M than Ford given the fact that they were allies nearly two decades ago before amicably parting ways to focus on their individual priorities. 
Goenka says the other important aspect of the ‘cultural fit’ issue is that both M&M and Ford are promoter-led where there is a Bill Ford and Anand Mahindra who can “come together and talk.. resolve things or give directions”. This cannot happen in professional-led companies where CEOs come and go.
This joint venture is also different from what M&M had done earlier with Renault or with Navistar. Those were India-centric and one-product JVs where the multinational partners used this as a route to enter India. In its turn, M&M leveraged the alliances to learn more about the auto industry and its various aspects. To that extent, the focus was short-term and limited to the scope defined. However, the JV with Ford is different in that it is not just India-centric.
“We would expect that at any given point of time, the export volumes will be higher than domestic numbers as has been the case with Ford historically, in India. There are also multiple products and continuous product development,” elaborates Goenka. By the end of the day, it is a story of two former partners coming together on a foundation of mutual trust and respect for each other’s competencies. As he says, it is a case of equal partners who individually bring a lot of value to the table. 
“Let's combine together and create a lot more value,” says an optimistic Goenka on the rationale of combing strengths for a common goal. If things go according to plan, the sky is the limit for both companies. “We can share plants, sourcing, suppliers, network…” he adds."
