In its 60th Annual General Meeting, Nestlé India said all resolutions including the one for continuity of royalty payments were approved with an overwhelming majority.
Nestle India will pay 4.5 per cent of its net sales as royalty to its Swiss parent.
In a statement, Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Nestlé India said that the shareholders have shown faith in management’s ability to deliver long term shareholder value. 
The FMCG major had earlier this month said that after receiving feedback from investors, it had modified its resolution pertaining to royalty payments . It had said that though General Licensing Agreements are reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee, the resolution was modified to provide for shareholder approval every five years in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
The resolution did not propose any revision in rates of royalty payment."

Nestle India posted a net profit of ₹463.28 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, up 9.25 per cent year-on-year. The company, which follows the January-December period as its financial year, had posted a net profit of ₹424.03 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. 
Revenue from operations for the quarter under review grew 9 per cent to ₹3,003 crore.
“The board had declared on April 25, an interim dividend for 2019 of ₹23 per equity share (face value ₹10 per equity share) amounting to ₹222 crore for 2019; this will be paid on and from May 15,” the company said in a statement.
While total sales grew 9 per cent, domestic sales increased 10.2 per cent. Exports dropped by 8.9 per cent, a company statement said.
Suresh Narayanan, CMD, Nestle India, said: “We have continued on the track of volume-led growth with our iconic brands like Maggi, Kitkat and Nestle Munch delivering strong performances. The market momentum remained strong, while the input costs have hardened.”"

Maggi noodles maker Nestle India's shares rose as much as 3 per cent to Rs 10,499.8, its best day in nearly seven weeks.
The company's March-quarter profit and revenue have risen. 
Domestic growth of 10.2 per cent y-o-y and commentary on sustained market momentum were a key positive amid talks of a slowdown, Jefferies said.
The company has announced the launch of organic food products; Edelweiss said. Nestle has been strengthening its position in existing brands, enhancing penetration and is in the quest of constant innovations.
Nestle's focus on innovation, new launches, market share and premium products will boost volume-led growth, Edelweiss said.
Shares of the company are down around 8 per cent YTD as of last close."

Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Nestle India




Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Nestle India


Leading packaged food company Nestle India on Friday said that it has forayed into the organic food category, in line with its innovation strategy to tap new consumer opportunities.
The company will launch three products in the organic food category which include an organic variant of its kids cereals brand Ceregrow.
Nestle has recorded a double-digit growth in its sixth quarter, in terms of domestic sales in the January-March period, at a time when the FMCG industry has expressed concerns about rural demand slowdown.
Addressing reporters at a roundtable, Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Nestle India, said: “Overall from the FMCG industry perspective, there has been a rural slowdown, with issues due to credit flows in the market and aberrations with certain channels.”
He added, “But it’s too early to say that it’s a systemic issue and I believe the fundamental view on strong consumption led-growth cannot be dismissed.”
The CMD said, “Where Nestle has come out stronger as compared to our peers, in terms of volume growth in Q1, is due to the fact that about 25 per cent of the company’s sales come from rural regions, while 75 per cent sales come from urban regions. Urban growth rates were consistently maintained.”
However, Narayanan said that below-than-normal levels of monsoon could pose challenges in terms of prices of agro-commodities for the industry. Replying to a query, he said, “If monsoons are going to be less-than-optimal, there would be a dampening effect as far as the rural demand is concerned. In terms of agro-commodities, the trend is clearly going upwards for raw materials such as milk and wheat. This will exacerbate if the monsoons are not as good as predicted.” He pointed out that India’s relatively stable performance has been due to low levels of food inflation in the past couple of years and that “could change if the monsoon situation becomes difficult.”
“In the last two quarters we have noticed that because of the scarcity of credit, the level of stocks — for example wholesale channels that are either buying or stocking — has come down,” he said.
Narayanan added, “It has not been serious enough for Nestle India’s growth because our wholesale footprint is relatively small.” 
He also said that the foray into the organic food segment is in line with the company’s focus on strengthening its food and nutrition portfolio. 
“We are working with farms with expertise in organic farming capabilities in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, to procure organic raw materials. Now that we have built expertise in terms of sourcing and procurement, we will look at expanding our organic food portfolio,” he added."

KitKat maker uses cocoa leftovers to sweeten dark chocolate

Nestle SA has found a way to create chocolate without adding any sugar, relying on leftover material from cocoa plants for sweetening as consumers look for natural and healthier fare.
The food company is using a patented technique to turn the white pulp that covers cocoa beans into a powder that naturally contains sugar. This fall in Japan, Nestle will start selling KitKat bars with 70 per cent dark chocolate under the new recipe, which doesn’t include any added sugar, the Vevey, Switzerland-based firm said. Until now, the pulp has never been used as a sweetener for chocolate, and usually its thrown out.
Read also: Doctors press for ‘sin tax’ on sugar-sweetened beverages
Nestle could use the same process to make milk or white chocolate in the future, Alexander von Maillot, head of Nestles confectionery business, said in a phone interview.
The food and beverage industry is under pressure from consumers and governments alike to make healthier products amid rising obesity and diabetes rates. Nestles move may bolster its position as a leader in the industry, and it comes three years after finding a way to alter the structure of sugar to make it sweeten food more in lower quantities.
The world’s largest food company plans to use the pulp technique for other confectionery brands in additional countries next year.
Nestle’s new 70 per cent dark chocolate will have as much as 40 per cent less sugar than most equivalent bars with added sugar. Nestles existing dark chocolate KitKat’s have 12.3 grams of sugar per serving.
The sugar reduction is incidental, not a focus, de Maillot said. Its more about a novel way to produce chocolate and use the best of the cocoa pod."

Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and MD, Nestle India




Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and MD, Nestle India


 Nestle India on Friday said it will set up its ninth factory in the country at Sanand, Gujarat, with an initial investment of about ₹700 crore over two years. 
The company posted a net profit of ₹437.84 crore for the second quarter ended June 30, up 10.8 per cent from ₹395.03 crore posted in the corresponding quarter last fiscal. Revenue from operations grew 11.2 per cent to ₹3,000.85 crore. It follows a January-December financial year. 
In a statement, Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Nestle India, said: “In line with our commitment to ‘Make in India’, we will soon commence the construction of our newest, and ninth, factory in India, at Sanand, Gujarat. This state-of-the-art, environmentally sustainable factory for Maggi noodles will involve an initial investment of nearly ₹700 crore over the next two years and will generate employment for about 400 people.”
Meanwhile, Nestle India’s board has declared an interim dividend of ₹23 per equity share (face value ₹10) for 2019, amounting to ₹2,217.6 million out of current year profits. It also plans a special interim dividend of ₹180 per equity share out of the accumulated profits of previous years. The total amount of ₹203 per share will be paid from August 23. 
The company said domestic sales in the second quarter grew 13.1 per cent “largely driven by volume and mix and positively influenced by sales to CSD and sale of surplus fat”. However, export sales dropped 13.9 per cent due to lower coffee exports to Turkey. 
Talking about the quarterly earnings, Narayanan said: “I am pleased to share that with this quarter, we have delivered 10 straight quarters of volume and mix-led growth...However, the environment continues to be challenging with headwinds in commodity prices and softer demand conditions.”"

 Shares of Nestle India on Monday rose by over 3 per cent after the company reported an increase of 10.83 per cent in net profit for the second quarter ended June 30.
The scrip of the company gained 3.25 per cent to close at Rs 11,799 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). During the day, it rose by 4.23 per cent to Rs 11,912.
 On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), shares went up by 3.23 per cent to close at Rs 11,781.
 FMCG major Nestle India on Friday reported an increase of 10.83 per cent in net profit to Rs 437.84 crore for the second quarter ended June 30 led by sales and volume growth.
 The company, which announced to invest around Rs 700 crore to set up a new factory in Sanand, Gujarat, had reported a profit of Rs 395.03 crore in the corresponding period of 2017-18.
 Nestle would manufacture its range of popular instant noodles Maggi in the new factory and generate employment for around 400 persons, in which half of the strength would be women, it said in a statement.
 The company, which follows January-December as its financial year, posted a net sales of Rs 2,982.83 crore, a rise of 11.35 per cent as compared with Rs 2,678.57 crore in the year-ago period."
11,2019-08-19,Nestle,"Nestle India sees growth in FMCG segment slowing to single digit 


Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and MD, Nestle India




Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and MD, Nestle India


Nestle India believes though the FMCG industry has been witnessing a muted growth rate in the past few quarters, it is unlikely to see the negative growth trajectory as seen in the automobile sector. The company proposes to intensify its focus on volume-led growth to increase penetration of its products in Tier-2 and -3 towns.
This will be done with relevant marketing and ad spends to grow its brands in the challenging economic environment, the company said.
Speaking at a media roundtable, Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Nestle India, said, “The overall FMCG industry growth has been going southwards. But the kind of issues other sectors, like automobiles, is facing may not get necessarily replicated in this sector because it offers essential low- budget items that are important for daily consumption. Growth may come down from modest double digits to decent single digit but it will not be in the negative territory.”
Nestle India has recorded 10 consecutive quarters of value growth. The company said it will continue to focus on bringing in new innovations as well as strengthening distribution in rural regions. “We have direct distribution in over 52,000 villages and we plan to double this in the next 2-3 years,” he added.
Since 2016, the Swiss major has launched nearly 61 innovations in India. New products contributed to nearly 3.7 per cent to the company’s domestic sales in the first half of this year. After launching its malt beverage brand Milo in ready-to-drink format, the company is next launching it in the powder format. The brand will now be directly competing with other key health food drink brands such as Horlicks and Boost.
“Globally, Milo is the number one cocoa-malt beverage. We felt the time was right to bring it in the powder format in India. It will initially be launched in the Southern States and then we will look at rolling it out to other parts of the country,” Narayanan said. For now, the product is being imported from Singapore but has been specifically tailored for the Indian consumers.
Asked whether the company will increase prices, Narayanan said that for now the company is looking to mitigate the impact of rising costs of commodities. “Since our core strategy is penetration-led volume growth, we will try to hold on to the price points. But if commodity prices continue to rise, we may have to look selective prices hikes. Some price hike has already been done in the milk and nutrition category,” he added.

8,2019-09-23,Nestle,"Corporate tax cuts: Stocks that gain the most
Earnings growth for India Inc, which has been on first gear in recent times, is all set to receive a boost from lower tax outgo, with the reduced corporate tax rates. For many manufacturing companies, the savings on this front could give them room to reduce prices or improve other spends, thereby spurring demand. Many companies in sectors such as infrastructure, capital goods and FMCG stand to gain. Some others in the auto, steel, oil and gas, and real-estate segments could also get a leg-up. IT companies may be better off under the current regime though, given the lower tax incidence at present.
Most companies in the information technology space will not be enthused by the corporate tax rate cuts announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. There are two reasons. Many companies have an effective corporate tax rate below 25.17 per cent (including surcharge and cess) and they get the benefit of profit-based deductions for exporting their services from special economic zones in India.
Also, IT and software companies that build their own intellectual property get a weighted deduction under the income-tax laws on the R&D expenses that they have incurred to build their IP.
Now, such companies might have to pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) calculated on their book profits.
The Finance Minister has slashed MAT from 18.5 per cent to 15 per cent. That puts the effective tax rate, including surcharge, for companies paying MAT at 17.5 per cent compared with 21.6 per cent earlier.
This means that IT companies that get tax deductions on their export revenues earned from operating in SEZs, and pay MAT, wouldn’t want to opt out of claiming these deductions. They would also have to forego the weighted deduction on R&D that brings down the effective corporate tax rate.
Besides, if they opt for the lower effective corporate tax rate of 25.2 per cent, they will have to take a one-time charge of any MAT credit that might be in their books.
In 2018-19, out of the top-tier IT companies in the S&P BSE IT Index, only Infosys (26 per cent) had an effective tax rate of over 25 per cent at the standalone level, while TCS (21.3 per cent), HCL Technologies (23.7 per cent), Wipro (23.02 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (19.6 per cent) had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
Even most mid-tier IT companies such as Mphasis (20.5 per cent), Hexaware (22.3 per cent), Mindtree (24.9 per cent), L&T Infotech (21.7 per cent) and L&T Technology Services (24.2 per cent), had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
In all, IT companies won’t be rushing to opt out of their export-based tax incentives until the benefit of paying lower taxes on export revenues runs out.
With major players such as Hindustan Unilever, Nestle, Britannia, GSK Consumer and Colgate-Palmolive suffering an effective tax of 32-36 per cent, the FMCG segment could be a beneficiary of the new 25.17 per cent tax rate.
At the same time, home-grown companies such as Dabur, Jyothy Labs, Godrej Consumer, Bajaj Consumer and Marico may not choose to move to the new regime, considering that their effective tax rates are either on a par with or lower than 25.17 per cent.
Overall, for shareholders in FMCG stocks, this move could result in the 2018-19 profits of listed FMCG players, on an aggregate, inching up by 9 per cent.
However, FMCG companies can choose to retain a portion of the benefits to increase advertising spends and/or pass it on as price cuts to boost demand. In the quarter-ended June 2019, for instance, major FMCG companies clocked single-digit growth in sales due to poor volumes.
Going by the 2018-19 numbers, Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motors and Maruti Suzuki and Eicher Motors have an effective tax rate of 29-33 per cent and could benefit from the reduced rates. However, the rates of Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland, are much lower. Taking M&M ‘s reported tax expenses (standalone) for 2018-19, the effective tax rate is only at 24.17 per cent (21.3 per cent, considering the current year's tax expense alone).
The company also has a MAT credit of ₹1,116.35 crore in its books as on March 31, 2019. Ashok Leyland’s effective tax rate, given the reported tax expense for 2018-19, is 20.6 per cent (15.14 per cent taking the current year's expense alone). The company has availed itself of benefit to the extent of ₹233 crore on tax concessions and tax holidays in 2018-19 and has MAT credit on its books.
In such cases, companies may choose to continue under the current regime till the tax holiday/concessions exist. Since MAT also continues at a reduced rate of 15 per cent, these companies can choose to pay tax as per normal rates or as per MAT, whichever is higher — as has been the case until now. MAT credit can also be set off against the tax liability in future years.
Among auto ancillaries, MNC players such as SKF India, Goodyear and Bosch that have high effective tax rates of 33-36 per cent could be major beneficiaries. Put together, listed companies in the auto and auto ancillaries space may see a 3-5 per cent addition to their profits of 2018-19, if they choose to avail themselves of the 25.17 per cent tax rate.
For infrastructure companies, the effective tax rates in FY19, after taking into account all eligible exemptions and tax holidays, work out to 27-35 per cent of their standalone PBT. For companies such as Engineers India, Ircon International, Ashoka Buildcon and RITES, availing themselves of the lower tax rate of 25.17 per cent could translate to a 14-18 per cent jump in earnings, going forward. Whereas, giants such as Larsen & Toubro and IRB Infra developers could witness only a 2 and 5 per cent rise in PAT led by tax savings.
Among the pure construction players, NCC, Welspun and Sadhbav Engg could benefit. Certain companies have effective tax rates of less than 25 per cent, which can be on account of payment of minimum alternate tax, or availing themselves of benefits of differential depreciation on fixed assets under the IT Act. The effects of the amendments announced will hence have to be evaluated on a case-to-case basis.
For instance, Dilip Buildcon has an effective tax rate of 16 per cent in FY19 on account of MAT provisions (inferred from the annual report). Hence, the lowered MAT rates could bring down its effective tax rate further, and the company would also get the existing MAT credit entitlement.
On the other hand, Adani Port and SEZ now enjoy an effective tax rate of 21 per cent, after availing itself of deductions under Section 80IAB of the Income Tax Act for 10 years, with effect from FY07-08. This apart, it has several subsidiaries and joint ventures that can get tax holiday benefits under Section 80IA.
The company is also likely to benefit from the grandfathering of taxes on buyback, as the management had made a public announcement of the share buyback of ₹1,960 crore on June 4, 2019.
Among the cement manufacturers, the effective tax rate in FY19 for most companies (on a standalone basis) is less than 25 per cent — they may refrain from foregoing their exemptions and deductions. This includes large players like Ultratech and Shree Cement. However, there could be savings in PAT in the range of 11-15 per cent for Himadri, Deccan and India Cements if they opt for the subsidised rates, as their current effective tax rate is more than 25.17 per cent.
The impact of the lower corporate tax on the steel industry is expected to be mixed, at least in the near future.
The tax incidence on companies such as Tata Steel, Kalyani Steels and Jindal Stainless Hisar in FY19 was 39 per cent, 33 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively. Note that these are the tax rates after taking into account the tax exemptions that the companies are eligible for. Thus, these companies stand to gain in a big way if they opt for the reduced tax rate of 22 per cent (25.17 per cent including surcharge and cess).
Companies such as JSW Steel and Tata Metaliks with effective tax rates of 20 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, may not opt for the reduced tax rate immediately. Meanwhile, SAIL, Jindal Steel and Uttam Galva had zero current tax for FY19. This could be either due to companies making losses in FY19 or accumulated losses from previous years, setting off the year’s profits. If the new reduced tax rate is opted, setting-off of losses will not be possible, making it unattractive. However, in the long run, when the companies turn profitable or become eligible to pay MAT, they can opt for the new tax rates, which could reduce their tax outgo.
The move to reduce corporate tax seems largely positive for real-estate companies reeling under pressure due to tight liquidity in the market. For most realty companies, the effective tax rate is higher than 25.17 per cent (including cess and surcharge), based on standalone profit before tax. For instance, for Oberoi Realty and Ashiana Housing, the current tax rate is 29 per cent, while for Kolte-Patil, it works out to around 45 per cent.
These companies, if they adopt the new corporate tax regime, could improve their earnings, even if they forego their exemptions and MAT credit.
If players pass on the benefit to home buyers, it could spur demand in the market.
But for companies such as Sunteck Realty and Prestige Estate Properties, for which the effective current year tax rates work out to less than 5 per cent, and Brigade Enterprises and Sobha with 23 per cent rate, continuing with the existing tax structure may be better.
For the oil and gas sector, the cut in corporate tax rate seems largely positive. Going by their FY19 standalone financials, the effective tax rate for most companies in the sector is higher than the 25.17 per cent rate (including surcharge and cess) that will apply to them now. For instance, in FY19, the current tax provision of city gas distributors Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas was about 31 per cent of their profit before tax.
The effective tax rate for the PSU hydrocarbon explorers, ONGC and Oil India, and gas transmitter GAIL (India) was 27-28 per cent, while it was about 29 per cent for PSU refiner HPCL. The highest tax rate — about 32 per cent — was borne by Gujarat-based gas transmitter GSPL. For the above companies, the new tax rate of 22 per cent plus surcharge of 10 per cent and cess of 4 per cent — totalling 25.17 per cent — should translate into lower tax outgo. Even if these companies have to give up some investment-based tax exemptions and credit of minimum alternate tax carried forward from earlier years, they should be better off under the new tax rate regime.
On the other hand, there are a few companies such as Reliance Industries, PSU refiners Indian Oil and BPCL, and gas importer Petronet LNG that may not benefit from the new tax rate. In FY19, the current tax provision of Reliance Industries, Indian Oil and BPCL was about 20 per cent of their profit before tax — this is lower than the new effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
It is the same case for Petronet LNG, which had an effective tax rate of about 24 per cent last year. For these companies, it may be worthwhile continuing with their existing tax structure, taking the benefits, if any, of investment-based tax exemptions, and carried forward MAT credit and carried forward loss.
In the case of Reliance Industries, for instance, while the applicable tax rate in FY19 was 34.94 per cent, it was able to reduce the effective rate (excluding deferred tax adjustments) to about 20 per cent, thanks to exempted income, and additional allowances net of MAT credit.
The company may likely find it more beneficial to continue with this arrangement until the tax breaks that keep the effective tax low are exhausted.
Later, it could shift to the new regime with the effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman opened the liquidity tap for corporates on Friday by announcing a sharp tax cut and leaving more money in their hands for capacity expansion. The statutory tax rate for corporates has been lowered to 22 per cent from 30 per cent. This benefit, though, is only for companies that wish to give up their tax exemptions. Given that most tax incentives and exemptions have been phased out over the past few years, companies may prefer to forego the few they enjoy now, and opt to be taxed at the lower rate of 22 per cent.
New manufacturing companies incorporated after October 1, 2019, can benefit from an even lower rate of 15 per cent tax if they don’t claim the tax benefits they are eligible for. India Inc will also get relief on MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax). The Finance Minister has reduced MAT to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent. This would benefit companies located in SEZ developers, infrastructure, cement companies, companies with units in specified locations in the North-East and exporters. There is also relief on buyback tax.
The 20 per cent tax on buybacks by corporates, which was announced in the Budget on July 5, 2019, would not apply to companies that announced them before the Budget day. According to data from nseinfobase.com, companies, including Sasken Technologies, Greaves Cotton, Welspun Corp, Star Cement and Eris Lifesciences, whose issues are on the way, but were announced before July 5, and for companies such as Infosys, which had buybacks ongoing in July, will benefit from the change. Wipro is also set to benefit as it announced its buyback on June 5.
Companies that pay corporate taxes under the new rates of 15 and 22 per cent will be charged a flat surcharge of 10 per cent, irrespective of their taxable income. The companies that choose the existing regime, availing exemptions and deductions, will have to pay a surcharge only if their total income exceeds ₹1 crore. The rates of surcharge for them will continue to be at 7 per cent and 12 per cent, for total income between ₹1 crore and ₹10 crore and more than ₹10 crore, respectively.
The stock market on Friday cheered the Finance Minister’s move to cut taxes. While companies that are currently paying lower rates due to various deductions and exemptions, such as many information technology players, are unlikely to shift to the new regime, there are many companies across sectors that are likely to see their tax incidence move lower, thus translating to higher profits. If the lower tax incidence is passed on to customers in the form of price cuts, it can help spur demand.
 








 
Ever since the late Finance Minister Arun Jaitley kick-started the process of a phased reduction in corporate tax in 2016-17 and elimination of exemptions, the effective tax rate for India Inc has only gone up.
This is because, while smaller companies were given the benefit of a lower tax rate each year, the phasing out of some tax deductions began impacting the tax outgo of larger companies.
Further, in 2015-16, the Finance Minister also increased the surcharge on corporate tax. That year, for companies with income of up to ₹10 crore, the surcharge was increased to 7 per cent from 5 per cent, and for firms with income above ₹10 crore, it was increased to 12 per cent from 10 per cent. Thus, the effective tax rate in 2017-18 came to 29.49 per cent; it was 23.22 per cent in 2013-14. This increase — evident in the numbers of the past one year — was due to larger companies coughing up more.
In 2017-18, the effective tax rate for companies making profit of more than ₹500 crore was 26.3 per cent; in 2016-17, it was 23.94 per cent. The effective tax rate for smaller companies making profit of ₹1-10 crore came down to 27.38 per cent from 29.2 per cent. So far, withdrawal of tax exemptions has made the effective tax rate of larger companies move higher. It is from here on that these companies will start benefiting.
Now, all companies that are willing to give up their tax incentives can pay taxes at a fairly lower rate of 22 per cent.
 
India is now among the countries that have a low corporate tax rate, and can compete better globally. For the current year, KPMG data show that the statutory tax rate in Myanmar is 25 per cent; in Malaysia, it is 24 per cent; 25 per cent in Indonesia and Korea and 28 per cent in Sri Lanka. Even Chinese companies cough up more — as they pay a tax of 25 per cent — and in Brazil, it is 34 per cent.
The global average corporate tax rate is 23.79 now, and the Asian average is 21.09 per cent. That said, the current move to cut taxes is going to make a hole in the government’s tax kitty. Last year, as per the Budget estimates, the revenue foregone by the Centre on various tax incentives was ₹1.08-lakh crore. Now, with tax cuts, there will be an additional revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore.
 
Bond investors who have been basking in the double-digit return glory over the past year may be in for a bumpy ride ahead. While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s corporate tax rate cut has cheered India Inc and the equity market, the move is a dampener for bond markets.
This is because the revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore owing to the cut will throw the Centre’s fiscal deficit target off track. The RBI’s surplus transfer to the Centre, at best, makes up for the existing shortfall in income tax and GST collections. While higher proceeds from disinvestment and some tax buoyancy (towards the end of the fiscal), on account of the growth-boosting measures, can aid revenues, for now, the ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue loss appears to have left a big hole in the Centre’s kitty. The fiscal deficit target could well move up to 4 per cent (from the projected 3.3 per cent), implying additional borrowings.
Based on the Controller General of Accounts’ (CGA) provisional figures for FY19 (in which income tax grew by a modest 7 per cent), the estimated growth in income tax collections for FY20 works out to 23 per cent. For April-July, CGA data suggest that the growth in net income tax was just about 6 per cent. There is also a significant shortfall in GST collections.
The surplus transfer by the RBI as recommended by the Bimal Jalan Committee has offered a much-needed respite to the Centre in the current fiscal. Excluding the ₹28,000-crore interim dividend already paid by the RBI to the Centre last fiscal, the net transfer in the current financial year amounts to ₹1,48,051 crore. But while optically, the surplus transfer appears to be a massive figure, essentially, it is about ₹60,000 crore above what was estimated in the Budget. Hence, this additional bonanza can help make good the shortfall in tax revenues.
On the disinvestment front, the Centre has set a target of ₹1.05-lakh crore (above the ₹85,000 crore achieved the previous year), which may be achievable. But given that the Centre has been missing its target on spectrum, it is unlikely to meet its estimate of ₹50,500 crore for FY20.
On balance, before the corporate tax rate cut, the Centre could have still pulled off the 3.3 per cent (risk of missing GDP growth assumptions though remained). The substantial ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue foregone on account of the corporate tax rate cut is an additional burden for the Centre that can take its fiscal deficit target to 4 per cent levels.
The joker in the pack is still the underlying growth in the economy. While the real GDP growth has fallen from 8 per cent last year to 5 per cent this fiscal in the April-June quarter, the sharp fall in nominal GDP growth from 12.6 per cent to 8 per cent during this period is worrisome.
The Centre’s fiscal deficit target assumes a 11 per cent growth in nominal GDP growth for FY20 (from the Central Statistics Office’s FY19 estimates), which is a tall task. If growth falters further, the fiscal deficit target can even move beyond 4 per cent levels.
The biggest overhang for Indian bond markets has been the huge gross market borrowings by the Centre pegged at a high ₹7.1-lakh crore in the current fiscal (from ₹5.71-lakh crore last year). But given that the borrowing calendar has been front-loaded, the market was factoring in the easing of supply of bonds in the second half of the fiscal.
For the April-September 2019 period, issuance of government securities amounts to ₹4.42-lakh crore; the balance ₹2.68-lakh crore of gross borrowings will come in the second half. But the supply of bonds in the second half could go up now. The stimulus announced by the Centre would lead to additional borrowings, which implies more supply of bonds and higher yields (bond prices and yields are inversely related).
Going ahead with the foreign sovereign bond issuance could be a saving grace. The ₹70,000-odd crore of foreign sovereign bonds pegged in by most economists can help lower bond yields in the domestic market.
Even though the RBI cut its policy repo rate by a notable 35 basis points in its August policy, Indian bond yields have only inched up. From 6.3 per cent levels in the beginning of August, the yield on 10-year government bonds has increased to 6.6 per cent levels, already factoring in expectations of a fiscal stimulus from the Centre. Post the FM’s move on corporate tax rate, the yield has moved up by another 20 basis points.
Given that expectations of fiscal slippage has been factored into bond yields to some extent, bond yields could remain range-bound in the near term, until there is more clarity on foreign sovereign bond issuance, GST collections and the disinvestment agenda. Expectations of the RBI cutting rates further, given the sanguine inflation trends, may also cap the upside in bond yields. That said, notable rise in yields cannot be ruled out in the coming months, given the significant slip on fiscal deficit and volatile rupee.
Given the uncertainty around various factors impacting bond yields, investors must cap their expectations and tread with caution. Long-term gilt funds as a category has delivered 15-16 per cent returns over the past year, thanks to the sharp rise in bond prices. A rise in yield (fall in prices) hereon can impact returns.
Hence, investors should avoid duration and credit risk in their portfolio. A chunk of your debt fund investments should be in short-term debt funds that carry less volatility in returns. Short- and medium-duration debt funds having a duration of up to 3-4 years are ideal for investors with medium risk appetite. Opt for corporate bond funds that invest a chunk of their assets in high-rated debt instruments."

Shares of Indiabulls Housing Finance (IBH) ended nearly 5 per cent lower on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) amid reports that a public interest litigation has been filed against the company and its promoters.
The IBH scrip ended 4.95 per cent lower at ₹425.75 apiece on the BSE on Friday, and dropped 9.31 per cent to hit a 52-week low of ₹406.20 apiece during intra-day trade.
The company, which is in the midst of a merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank, said it is “determined to fight out petitioners in court”.
For past three months, IBH is undergoing inspections by regulators as part of the merger process, it said in a regulatory filing.
“It has come to our notice through media that a PIL has been filed against the company (IBH) and promoters in the Delhi High Court. The petition has not yet been filed in High Court as per its website, but was leaked in social media with malicious intent to create turbulence in IBH stock price,” it said.
It further said that the purported PIL admits that the allegations are the same as in the earlier petition filed by Abhay Yadav, which was later withdrawn.
“Abhay in his statement admitted that allegations against IBH were based on incorrect and twisted data and that he had filed it at the behest of the mastermind of a blackmailing racket and he has been arrested and is in jail,” IBH said, adding that the petitioners have chosen the route of PIL to attract attention and play into the hands of blackmailers and corporate rivals at a sensitive time of merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank."

Two studies related to new mothers and babies, sponsored by Switzerland-based multi-national Nestle, have been found illegal by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The research body noted this after forming a committee to discuss the issue.
The two studies were titled - ‘Study of milk composition from adequately nourished and undernourished mothers,’ and ‘Infant feeding practice and gut comfort: A multi-country-sectional observation.’
In the first study, it was proposed to collect breast milk samples of 260 new mothers between 18 to 40 years over six months to analyse it’s components like fat, lactose, energy, solid and crude proteins.
This was to be conducted in Adhithya Adhikari Hospital in Mysore, Bharati Hospital in Pune, Mazumdar Shaw Medical Centre in Bangalore and Gangaram Hospital in New Delhi.
The second study proposed to enroll 4000 new borns between 37 to 42 weeks who are being exclusively breastfed or are on exclusive formula feeding for ascertaining their gut comfort in five countries – Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan. In India, Chennai-based Apollo Childrens Hospital, Thane-based Dr Praveen Gokhale’s Clinic and Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital as well as Kolkata-based ICH Hospital, were participating in the study.
The ICMR committee noted, “The studies in question are violative of Section 9(2) of Infant Milk Substitute Act 1993 as amended in 2003, given the fact that the study falls under the definition of research work, and the study is funded and sponsored by Nestle India, which is a producer, supplier/distributor of Infant Milk Substitutes.”
The committee has further stated that these studies should be terminated immediately. It has opined that the investigators of the studies should be asked to change the registration status to ‘terminated,’ under the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI), which keeps a record of all ongoing trials in India.
The committee has also said that the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) should examine whether the respective instituitional ethics committees which permitted these studies were constituted in accordance with existing regulations. It has also asked for an explanation so as to how such a study which is in violation with the law, was permitted in the first place by hospitals.
The ICMR committee has asked for sensitisation of the CTRI regarding provisions of IMS Act. It said that if the CTRI believes there is an infringement of the Act in an Indian study which has been submitted to them for registration, then it should defer registering such a study and bring it to the notice of appropriate authorities."
6,2019-09-30,Nestle,"Nestle India to strengthen ‘rural play’, optimistic on festival season sales
FMCG major Nestle India believes that while the ongoing festival season is expected to be positive for consumer goods companies, the next six months will be crucial for a steady revival in consumption.
The company also said that the government’s recent move to slash corporate taxes was a step in the right direction. It is looking to further bolster its presence in rural markets.
Replying to a query on the ongoing festival season, Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Nestle India said, “Consumer goods companies are looking forward to the festival season as they are expected to see a bump in demand. But for me, what needs to be seen is the short- to medium-term and how the next six months evolve.”
Stating that there are no short-term fixes for the ongoing slowdown, Narayanan added, “I have no reason to believe that the season will not be a good one but this alone will not be an answer to the long-term secular issues of consumption that seems to be foremost in the minds of most people in the industry.”
In July, market research firm Nielsen had cut its growth forecast for the sector to 9-10 per cent in 2019 from the previous forecast of 11-12 per cent.
Narayanan was addressing a media roundtable to commemorate ten years of Nestle Healthy Kids Programme, an initiative that focusses on raising health and wellness awareness.
Narayanan said, “Corporate tax reduction is expected to translate into better earnings for companies which will hopefully translate into better dividends putting extra cash in the hands of shareholders. This is expected to have a positive impact on consumption.”
The company believes that above average monsoons in 2019 could reduce growing pressures of high commodities prices.
Narayanan said that Nestle India currently draws about 25 per cent of sales from rural markets. It expects rural contribution to increase to about 30-35 per cent in the next 2-3 years. It will strengthen its rural play by launching low priced packs and rural-focussed innovations.

 Nestle SA is weighing options including a sale for two ailing Chinese units after years of attempting to turn them around, people familiar with the matter said.
The food giant has been reviewing its ownership of Hsu Fu Chi, a local confectionery brand, and Yinlu, known for its ready-made Chinese porridge, according to the people. It is seeking more than $1 billion for its controlling stakes in the two companies, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Nestle acquired both companies in 2011 as it sought to tap burgeoning demand in China, only to find itself confronted with sluggish growth a few years later. Since becoming chief executive officer in 2017, Mark Schneider has been weeding out the Swiss company’s portfolio, jettisoning assets such as US chocolate brands, a dermatology business and a life insurance unit for about $15 billion total.
Nestle, which makes Nespresso coffee and Gerber baby food, has made almost two dozen divestment under Schneider. It could opt to sell only part of its stakes in one or both of the Chinese units, according to one of the people.
Peanut milk, Chocolate
No final decisions have been made, and there is no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, the people said. A spokesman for Nestle declined to comment. Mergermarket reported earlier that Nestle was conducting a strategic review of the Yinlu business, citing unidentified people. Shares of Nestle rose as much as 0.4% in Switzerland on Tuesday.
Yinlu has sales of about 1 billion Swiss francs ($1 billion), Nestle said earlier this month. About two-thirds of the business is made up of local products like peanut milk and a porridge called congee, whose sales have been disappointing, the CEO said at the time. The rest is ready-to-drink coffee, which has been going better.
Were working very, very hard to address that situation, Schneider said on a call with analysts on Oct. 17. He has repeatedly said Nestle will sell businesses that are non-strategic if its not possible to fix them.
Hsu Fu Chi, which makes confectionery products and snacks, probably generates annual revenue of some 700 million francs, according to Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy. Nestle has tried to improve the packaging of Hsu Fu Chi chocolates and added nutritious snacks to appeal to more health-conscious millennial consumers."

Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and MD, Nestle India




Nestle India reported a net profit of Rs 595.41 crore up 33.46 per cent in the quarter ended September 30, 2019 due to lower tax expenses and strong domestic sales. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 446.11 crore in the corresponding quarter previous fiscal.
The company said that the net profit includes a one-off credit of Rs 72.5 crore accrued due to computation of tax expense at a lower tax rate in accordance with the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2019. The impact of this change including that of the previous quarter, has been recognised in the current quarter, it said.
According to the company, the provisioning has also impacted the current quarter’s net profit by the same amount and the ‘Earnings Per Share’ by Rs 7.5. 
The company, which follows the January-December period as the fiscal year, reported a 9.4 per cent rise in revenue from operations at Rs 3,215.81 crore in the third quarter this year.
Total sales grew by 9.5 per cent, while domestic sales grew by 10.5 per cent. However, export sales dropped by 7.1 per cent due to lower coffee exports to Turkey, it added.
Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Nestlé India said the company sustained the momentum of volume and mix led growth. The company said that key brands such as Maggi, Kitkat, Nestle Munch and Nescafe RTD delivered strong performances in the third quarter.
“The quarter witnessed higher commodity prices particularly in milk and its derivatives, which are likely to continue in the near term future,” he added."
3,2019-12-12,Nestle,"Profiteering charge against Nestle upheld
Profiteering watchdog under the Goods & Services (GST) regime, National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) on Wednesday held that Nestle’s methodology of passing reduction in the tax was arbitrary. Accordingly, NAA upheld allegation of profiteering of Rs 90 crore.
The Company said that it is studying the order and will consider appropriate action as advised.
The authority has asked the company to deposit Rs 73.14 out of Rs 89.73 crore of profiteering as remaining amount has already been deposited. Since the recipients are not identifiable, the amount will be deposited with Consumer Welfare Funds of Centre and States within three months.
According to the authority, narration of facts established the fact that the company denied thee the benefit of tax reduction to the customers and this is contravention of the law. “He (the company) is also liable for imposition of the penalty,” the order said and accordingly it has been decided to issue a show cause notice.
In a statement the company said that Nestlé India prides itself in being a responsible, responsive and fully compliant corporate citizen. “We have taken appropriate measures to pass on commensurate benefits of GST to our consumers In absence of specific rules or regulations on profiteering, for rate changes effective 15 Nov, 2017 & 25 Jan, 2018 impacting our products, Nestlé India adopted the spirit of GST law, by adopting a reasonable, pragmatic and market sustainable approach to pass commensurate GST rate reduction benefits. With this as the underlying spirit, Nestlé India approached NAA, to clarify on the methodology to be followed and in turn explained our methodology,” it said.
It claimed that the benefits largely have been passed on by way of reduction of Maximum Retail Price (MRP) or by way of increase in grammage. Further, on SKUs where it was not practicable to pass on the benefits, say for example NESCAFE single serve packs for INR 2/- or MAGGI Noodles INR 5/- packs, the benefit has been passed on other pack sizes within the same product category. 
In some situations where the benefit could not be passed on instantly by reduction in MRP or increase in grammage, the amount was set aside, to be subsequently passed on and was not reckoned either in our sales or profits. At our request, the authority through its communication had advised us to provisionally deposit the amount computed by us amounting to around INR 16.5 crore in the Consumer Welfare Fund, which had been done by us suo moto.
The information regarding passing of GST rate reduction benefit together with substantiations had been provided to the (NAA). However, “we are disappointed that NAA has not accepted the methodology adopted by us to pass on the GST rate reduction benefit,” it said.
Known for its packaged food brands such as Maggi, Kitkat and Nescafe, among others, the company was facing allegations of profiteering after rate of GST was lowered on over 175 products with effect from November 15, 2017. It was alleged that the company has not passed the benefit of rate reductions to the consumers.
 
Last year the matter was investigated by DG-AP (Director General-Anti profiteering) and it found the allegation true in certain products. Rules say, anti-profiteering provisions get applied if the benefit of reduction un rate of tax on any supply of goods or services or the benefit of input tax credit is not passed on to the recipient by way of commensurate reduction in prices. An application to invoke anti profiteering provisions can be made by an interested party or a Commissioner or any other person.
Last year the company deposited Rs 16.58 crore in the Consumer Welfare Fund. It was done after the Company request NAA which in turn advised the company to provisionally deposit the amount computed by it, suo moto."

FMCG major Nestle India respects the order by the National Anti-Profiteering Authority asking it to deposit Rs 73.15 crore with Consumer Welfare Fund for not passing GST rate reduction benefit to consumers, and will examine the next course of action to be taken, said Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Nestle India Ltd.
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Confederation of Indian Industry’s National FMCG Summit 2019, Narayanan added, “I respect the authority for the order that they passed. But, it is very unfortunate that despite all the evidence that we had provided them, in terms of the changes in grammage (and) the changes in prices that we had affected, we have received this order. I think as a company, we were very transparent, we went to the authority voluntarily, suo moto, saying that we have some part of the GST money that we are not able to pass on, so where should we deposit this money. That's how the discussion started and then we gave them exactly the methodology, but there is no existing methodology. So we told them pragmatically what we can do in terms of price change and in terms of grammage change.”
The NAA, which is the profiteering watchdog under the GST regime, had held last week that Nestle’s methodology of passing reduction in the tax was arbitrary. It rejected Nestle India's claims that it has passed on benefits of Rs 192 crore by reducing maximum retail price.
The company had said in a statement then that the benefits largely had been passed on by way of reduction of Maximum Retail Price (MRP) or by way of increase in grammage. Further, on SKUs where it was not practicable to pass on the benefits, say for example NESCAFE single serve packs for Rs 2/- or MAGGI Noodles Rs 5/- packs, the benefit has been passed on other pack sizes within the same product category.
Talking about this, Narayanan said, “And there are products which are let's say (priced at) Rs 2 and Rs 5. If the benefit is 25 naya paisa, 50 naya paisa or 45 naya paisa, we don't have those coins in the country. So, how will I be able to pass on all these benefits, even if I want to pass on those benefits?”"

At a time when the FMCG sector is facing the heat of the overall slowdown in the economy and growing at a rate of around 5-6 per cent, Nestle India has been witnessing a double-digit growth, due to its lower rural footprint vis-a-vis peers as well as its “very strong growth” in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, said Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director.
The sales growth comes in the backdrop of the rural growth for the FMCG sector dropping below urban growth for the first time in seven years, as per Nielsen’s India FMCG Growth Snapshot report on Q3 (July to September 2019).
The FMCG major has 20-25 per cent sales coming from the rural areas, which is lower compared to competitors. “For the first time in many quarters, the rural growth has actually gone below the urban growth. That has not happened till now. This is creating some stress points for companies which have a larger footprint in terms of rural sales, or have a portfolio that is also strong in rural (areas),” said the Nestle India chief. 
He observed that a combination of lower agricultural income, together with the overall stress in the economy, was creating this situation. 
“We have managed to show fairly strong volume-led growth in the last eight quarters,” said Narayanan, speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Confederation of Indian Industry’s National FMCG Summit 2019.
But, he underscored that the company is not insulated from the dampened sales in rural areas, as a quarter of its sales still comes from these areas. 
 The company has also been improving its access over the last couple of years, both in small towns and urban areas, he said. Earlier, it was covering around 4.5 million retail outlets and it is now looking at increasing it to around 5.5 million outlets.
 What has also worked in the favour of the company is that consumers are seeking brands which are associated with the highest level of trustworthiness, in terms of quality and value, said Narayanan. People in rural areas are also increasingly focussing on quality and brand value, he added. 
Nestle India plans to tap the health sciences product category further, he said. 
On whether the company has adopted any special strategy keeping in mind the slowdown, the Nestle India chief said, “I don't think there is anything specific that we did only for the slowdown. 
“The fact of the matter is that four years ago we had a massive crisis as a company — the whole Maggie episode that happened — so we were really very, very focused on bringing the company back on the rails and doing all the things that are in consonance with what the consumer is expecting of us — not only (bringing) the favourite brand back, but also new brands, new offerings, better advertising, greater investments behind the brands. So, we did whatever was in our belief essential to be a successful company.”
 Meanwhile, he termed the input cost pressure facing the FMCG industry a serious matter. Prices of commodities like milk and wheat, which FMCG companies are dependent on, have been increasing. Food inflation is here to stay, and it is not what it was a few years ago, he said.
“What we normally try and do is, we try and see if we can mitigate it through better efficiencies, through better economies. And only in a very extreme case do we look at increasing the prices, because we are cognizant of the fact that as we sharply increase the prices, the levels of penetration will also get affected. But it is a big challenge,” he said."
