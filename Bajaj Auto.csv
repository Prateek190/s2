Bajaj Auto is an India-based manufacturer of motorcycles, three-wheelers and parts. The company’s business segments include automotive, investments and others. The company’s vehicles include two-wheelers and commercial vehicles.
Bajaj Auto posted a good set of sales numbers, lead by domestic commercial vehicle sales. Domestic sales grew by 129 per cent y-o-y and the exports grew by 86 per cent y-o-y. However, if we compare on a month on month basis exports of commercial vehicles declined 13 per cent and domestic sales have declined marginally by 1 per cent. Domestic sales of commercial vehicles continue to show a good growth on back of rural focussed budget, exports will be the key going ahead. We have target of ₹3,220 on the stock."

Rajiv Bajaj is confident that his company will have a good run through 2018-19 both here and in overseas markets.
“Exports have now fallen into place and three-wheelers are rocking,” says the Managing Director of Bajaj Auto. “Our motorcycles are also doing well.” These include the new Pulsar NS, Avenger, Dominar 400 and Discover. On the anvil is a new ‘V’, which was first launched two years ago as a 150cc commuter bike and followed, in more recent times, by its 125cc sibling.
Rise in numbers
The company’s bike numbers have been rising in recent times thanks to the relaunch of the Discover in January. Data for February shows that bike sales in the domestic market have jumped 23 per cent to 1.76 lakh units with exports up 19 per cent at 1.22 lakh units.
Three-wheelers have shown a much higher increase at over 38,500 units sold in India last month, which is more than double of what was reported in the same period last year. This is also same for exports that recorded nearly 22,000 units compared to over 11,700 three-wheelers in February 2017 when key markets such as Africa virtually imploded.
Additionally, it is only a matter of time before the Qute debuts in the Indian market a good six years after it was first displayed at the 2012 Delhi Auto Expo. If everything goes according to plan, this 216cc quadricycle will be offered as an upgrade to the autorickshaw in the public transport category.
From Bajaj Auto’s point of view, while there is some cause for cheer, these are still early days yet to celebrate, especially in the executive commuter motorcycle space. The recently launched Discover duo (110cc and 125cc) is averaging over 30,000 units each month. But still has a long way to go in a product segment where Hero and Honda are miles ahead.
With scooters also eating into the commuter pie, the Discover will have its work cut out though the initial market response has been quite encouraging. The key is to sustain this momentum and ideally grow monthly numbers to over 50,000 units. The company has been unable to make much headway in the executive commuter space despite the fact that it has pulled out all the stops over the years with brands such as the Discover and the more contemporary ‘V’ in recent times.
“We will continue to focus on our strategy of differentiation and steer clear of me-too products,” reiterates Bajaj. For instance, the objective of ‘V’ was to create the ultimate commuter bike even though its numbers have been modest at 10,000 units each month. It will be interesting to see how the new ‘V’ is positioned and whether it can strike the right chord with its targeted customer.
Three parameters
As Bajaj puts it, a product is defined by three parameters: styling and design; performance and function; and finally cost/price. When it comes to the brand, the first part is to be able to tell a story where, while taking the executive commuter segment as a case in point, the Discover and ‘V’ have something to say. In the case of the former, it was the first 125cc commuter launched 14 years ago while the ‘V’ has the association with INS Vikrant, the country’s firstaircraft carrier whose metal was recycled for the bike.
The next aspect of the brand is the experience and, finally, the product itself. When it comes to the Discover, even though it was in cold storage for a while, the brand had not been forgotten that explains its positive market reception. Of course, its manufacturer had also done careful market research to ensure the right mix of ingredients for the new Discover, which will also extend to the rejuvenated ‘V’.
Bajaj Auto is also confident about the Dominar 400, which was positioned as the alternative to Royal Enfield’s vice-like grip in mid-size motorcycles. While its numbers are still hovering around 4,500 units each month (including exports), the company believes that its potential is a lot more. Even here, differentiation was the guiding principle while offering a bike that was muscular and contemporary.
“Of course, we would like to see 10,000 units every month for the Dominar 400,” responds its MD. For now, the twin brand strategy across its motorcycle portfolio is working well, especially at the entry-level with the CT 100 and Pulsar and sports with the Pulsar and Avenger.
The challenge is to replicate this with the Discover and ‘V’ in the executive commuter space and this is especially critical since this product category accounts for a lion’s share of bikes sold in India.
It is also here that scooters, led by Honda Activa, have made a huge impact and successfully taken on established motorcycle brands like the Hero Splendor.
Making an impact
Bajaj Auto had realised years ago that the only way to make an impact here was to be different and this puts in context why it launched the Discover 125 way back in 2004 at a time when this arena was all about 100cc bikes. The brand had everything going in its favour except that, in hindsight, a needless detour could have been avoided in launching the XCD 125.
In all fairness, the company quickly set right its business plan and decided to focus on the Discover all over again along with the well established Pulsar. Here again, things started off on the right note but as a host of versions followed, the script went off track. With renewed market research/inputs, the new Discover is intended to set things right even while it has a long haul ahead with rivals such as Hero and Honda equally determined to grow their presence in this segment.
Beyond its own brands, Bajaj Auto also has the KTM range firing on all cylinders both in India and overseas markets.
The Austrian bike maker, in which Bajaj has a 48 per cent stake, has successfully leveraged its ally’s manufacturing skills for over a decade now to make 125-400cc bikes at Chakan near Pune, which are exported to a host of countries.
This plant will soon have a new resident in the form of Husqvarna, the Swedish brand that KTM acquired in 2013 and is now keen on seeing it go global too.
This is where the cost-competencies at Chakan will play a big role in catapulting the Husqvarna range to markets in the Asia-Pacific region.
The next big thing is the alliance with Triumph of the UK where the partners are “in the thick of product development”. If things go according to plan, the first range of mid-size motorcycles will be ready to roll out of the Chakan plant in 2020."

74,2018-05-29,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj’s e-mobility mantra: Start at the top with ‘irresistible’ products


Rajiv bajaj, MD, Bajaj Auto




Rajiv bajaj, MD, Bajaj Auto


Rajiv Bajaj believes it is important to push the envelope in the electric mobility space and make products that are “irresistible” to potential buyers.
The Managing Director of Bajaj Auto says it is important to “start at the top”, and not the bottom, while developing electric two- and three-wheelers. This is on the lines of what Telsa Motors has achieved and has now become a reference point for aspiration and pride of ownership.
Bajaj says he is only too aware of the realities of India’s electric mobility arena, which include uncertainties relating to charging infrastructure, reliability of batteries, costs, charging time, fuel and environmental concerns and so on.
Make a mark
While these are issues that cannot be wished away, he is of the view that his company can adopt a different approach and still make a mark. “By the end of the day, you cannot fight perception and need to use it to your advantage,” he says. It also puts in context why an emotional, and not logical, approach is perhaps the best way forward. This will mean developing world-class products that offer the best in styling, design and engineering. It is this differentiator strategy of starting at the top that has seen Tesla grow as a premium brand across the world. 
Likewise, if things work to plan for Bajaj product(s) in terms of range, charging time and reliability, word-of-mouth will soon create a snowballing effect where suppliers “start coming to you”. 
The government will then also do its bit by helping out with charging stations and all this will lead to the creation of a vibrant electric ecosystem. 
CNG experience
From Bajaj Auto’s point of view, this is just not misplaced optimism but based on actual experience. 
This was the time, a little over 15 years ago, when compressed natural gas was made mandatory in New Delhi and the company’s auto rickshaws had to fit into the new regime.
It was not a walk in the park since this involved a new fuel option as well as more work for Bajaj Auto on product development and R&D. Auto rickshaw drivers were apprehensive about the transition and range of the new vehicles.
As more retail outlets cropped up in Delhi, and CNG supplies increased, the script ended up working to perfection. This is what gives the company the confidence that something similar could happen in the electric space too.
e-scooter launch
Speculation has also been rife that Bajaj Auto is gearing up to launch its first electric scooter this year though its MD did not comment on the subject.
The news has been creating some excitement given that the company had stopped manufacturing geared scooters some years ago and decided to shift its two-wheeler focus solely to motorcycles. 
An electric scooter would, of course, be completely different in terms of volumes and its potential customer base. Yet, it will still revive fond memories of the ‘Hamara Bajaj’ era and the overwhelming presence of the Chetak scooter brand in the market.
What can be said with some certainty is that Bajaj Auto will put out its first electric product in the market by 2020, when Bharat Stage VI emission norms also become a reality. These electric two- and three-wheelers will, in all likelihood, be sold in India and other parts of the world.
By this time, Bajaj may also have in place its first range of mid-size motorcycles in the 300-650cc range jointly developed with Triumph of the UK.
These will be manufactured at the Chakan plant near Pune, already home to the KTM motorcycle range and soon to be joined by Swedish brand, Husqvarna, in 2019."

Stepping on the gas Two-wheeler companies will look to expand further




Stepping on the gas Two-wheeler companies will look to expand further


To regain its lost glory in the commuter motorcycle segment, Bajaj Auto plans to launch new products and strengthen the existing line-up in the next two years.
Though the company continued doing well at the entry-level segment — with its CT 100, Platina and Discover 100/110 — as also in sports and ‘super-sports’ segments, with its Pulsars, Avengers, the Dominar 400 and the KTMs, it could not perform adequately in the large ‘commuter’ segment and sold less than what was expected.
“Hopefully, this gap will be taken care of in the next couple of years through existing and new products. This is a critical segment,” Rahul Bajaj, Chairman, Bajaj Auto, said in the company’s latest annual report.
Bajaj’s offerings in the commuter segment include Discover 125 and the V. It is here that the company performed poorer than expected, and did not meet the tough targets that it had set for itself.
In FY2018, KTM was the fastest growing motorcycle brand for the company, logging a growth of 32 per cent at 46,321 units. This performance is partly on account of the success of the new MY17 product range, and the introduction of a new model, the KTM Duke 250.
Strong export growth
While Bajaj’s domestic motorcycle sales declined a tad in 2017-18, its exports reported a strong growth after two challenging years. In FY2017, motorcycle exports were hit on account of sharp currency devaluations in critical African markets. Thankfully, that was a thing of the past.
In FY2018, Bajaj’s motorcycle exports grew by 14.5 per cent to about 1.4 million units and its three-wheeler exports rose 38.9 per cent, at 267,820 units.
Total revenues from exports rose to $1.36 billion (about ₹9,703 crore) in FY18 as against $1.09 billion (₹7,880 crore) in FY17.
The growth in motorcycle exports in FY18 came on the back of robust sales in Africa, led by the economic recovery in Nigeria, as well as in the ASEAN region due to product launches in the Philippines and entry into Malaysia.
Its focus on the sports segment in countries like Argentina in the Latin American market is paying rich dividends. Incidentally, new markets, where BAL has entered in the last three years, now contribute to almost half of the growth of three-wheeler exports.
BAL is optimistic about export prospects in FY2019 and is investing in its key markets, said the report."

69,2018-08-01,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj Auto skids as Q1 profits miss street expectations


Thanks to improving demand for bikes as well as better prospects in the export markets, Bajaj Auto posted double-digit growth in revenues and profits in the quarter ended June 2018. However, the stock was beaten down by 9 per cent on Friday after the results announcement, due to lower-than-expected profit growth as well as disappointment on the operating margin front.
Margins disappoint
For the April-June 2018 period, revenues grew by 26.6 per cent year-on-year to ₹7267 crore backed by a healthy overall volume growth of 38 per cent. Export volumes grew by 31 per cent with important markets such as Nigeria and Egypt leading the way. A depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar also helped improve realisations to ₹67.4 to a dollar from ₹66.8 to a dollar in the June 2017 quarter. 
Exports bring 35-40 per cent of the revenues for the company. However, though domestic motorcycle volumes grew by 39 per cent, a good chunk of it was driven by the strong sales in entry bikes (75-110 cc bikes) such as the CT 100 and the relaunch of the Discover 110. The company took a price cut of ₹3,000 for the CT 100 in March 2018. Thus, the adverse product mix as well as price cuts brought down domestic realisations. This, along with pressure from higher input costs affected operating margins. Raw material cost as a percentage of sales moved up to 71 per cent from 65 per cent a year ago. Thus, operating margins came at 17.3 per cent, compared with 20.7 per cent a year ago.
While reported profits grew by 20.6 per cent year-on-year to ₹1,115 crore, adjusted profit growth stood at a lower 16.6 per cent. In the June 2017 quarter, the company had incurred an exceptional expense of ₹32 crore for compensation given to dealers towards transition to GST.
Going forward, volume growth in bikes could remain strong due to launches such as CT100 ES, Platina ES, Platina Comfortec in the entry segment. But margins may remain under pressure. A better product mix tilted towards executive and premium bikes remains key for profitability on the domestic front. 
On exports, the company is targeting 1.9 million units this fiscal, a growth of about 14 per cent over the export numbers achieved in 2017-18. With the fortunes of its key export markets recovering, this looks achievable."

Fresh frontiers ahead: Rajiv Bajaj will have his hands full in the coming years
   -  PTI


It was sometime last year when the Bajaj Auto board had decided to elevate Rakesh Sharma as part of a promotion plan. He was then head of international business and had clearly done an outstanding job in spearheading the company’s presence in a host of overseas markets.
Yet, Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director of Bajaj Auto, had other plans. “I chose not to put him in the hot seat immediately. Those were challenging times with the domestic motorcycle business not doing great numbers while exports were facing pretty strong headwinds,” he recalls. 
Additionally, there were other issues to reckon with in the form of high oil and commodity prices. Clearly, these were not the easiest of times for the company. “Had I stepped back then and given the reins to Rakesh, it might have sent the wrong signal. During difficult periods, it makes sense (as captain) to handle the ship yourself,” continues Bajaj. 
From his point of view, he was better equipped to tackle the situation since he was familiar with other aspects of the company’s business. On the contrary, it would have been difficult for Sharma to take over and adjust quickly during this trying period. It also explains why his promotion/elevation was held back for a year. 
Today, the tide has turned and Bajaj Auto has been doing exceptionally well in exports while staging a strong turnaround in its domestic bike business. Three-wheeler sales have also reached new highs, both here and overseas. Additionally oil prices are more stable now while there is far less volatility in export markets. “I believe Rakesh is better equipped to handle the challenges now and I am sure he will take the company to greater heights,” says a confident Bajaj. 
This also puts in context Sharma’s recent elevation as Chief Commercial Officer (CCO). While announcing this new position, Bajaj had indicated in a communique to employees that this was being done to strengthen the alignment between a “sharp and nimble front end and a deep and modular back end”.
As CCO, Sharma will now complement the efforts of Executive Director, Pradeep Shrivastava, and Chief Technology Officer, Abraham Joseph (Joe). The idea is to bring together all business units in the pursuit of better product harmonisation, marketing synergies, customer focus and corporate alignment. All the heads of the various verticals will report to the CCO.
“From my point of view, this (recast in responsibilities and reporting functions) was done keeping in mind that the person at the helm should be the best — in fact, better than me in the specific role assigned,” says Bajaj.
As he puts it, Sharma has a “fantastic track record in our global business”, which now accounts for a substantial chunk of overall output. Exports are tipped to touch two million units this fiscal with markets like Africa and Latin America now back on track and ASEAN now being the new focus area of growth. 
“With Rakesh now as CCO, there will be sharper focus at the front end where the verticals will be nicely balanced and integrated. Pradeep (Shrivastava), likewise, will handle the back-end in terms of processes and manufacturing across the plants,” says the MD.
It is also his view that the new management recast will go a long way in attracting young and dynamic talent to the organisation. “Ambitious graduates will be hopeful of leadership positions in the future when they see that there are the likes of Joe, Pradeep and Rakesh in top positions. It’s not as if you need to be a Bajaj to be able to call the shots,” stresses Rajiv Bajaj.
So what will his new role then be, you wonder. After all, he has been the face of the company for many years now. Going by his communique, Bajaj has clearly stated that the recent reorganisation of roles will enable him to take a couple of steps back in order that “I may address some other matters that will merit my attention into the future”.
You ask Bajaj what he is implying through this statement and he puts it in perspective. From his point of view, there are no two ways about the fact that Bajaj Auto is a focussed company, which specialises in the manufacture of motorcycles and three-wheelers.
“Despite being reasonably focussed, there are a host of areas that need to be taken care of right from the domestic and export business to KTM and Husqvarna as well as Urbanite and Triumph (in the near future),” elaborates Bajaj.
Given these new challenges, he believes it is imperative for him to focus on some of them especially Husqvarna, Urbanite and Triumph. To elaborate, Husqvarna is the Swedish motorcycle brand that KTM acquired from BMW five years ago. By 2019, it will be part of Bajaj Auto’s Chakan production line, which is already manufacturing KTM motorcycles that are sold both here and overseas. 
Urbanite is the new vertical created for electric mobility where the focus will be on two- and three-wheelers. If things go according to plan, the first offering (be it a scooter or motorcycle) will be out on the roads before 2020.
Finally, Triumph marks a new alliance to make mid-size motorcycles again from the Chakan plant. The British brand tied up with Bajaj Auto recently to market this category of bikes both in India and emerging markets. Given these huge responsibilities, Bajaj says there is just no way he can continue micro-managing each and every other vertical as was the case till recently. “This is where Rakesh will take over a big role and I am confident he will do very well,” he says.
Bajaj believes that, in his turn, he will have his hands full with the emerging businesses, which involve a lot of attention. Triumph and Bajaj Auto will have their first models out by 2020. Similarly, electric mobility is a new challenge where Urbanite, under its new Head, will also need some hand-holding.
While each of these brands (KTM, Triumph, Husqvarna, Urbanite) represent multiple verticals and a set of different complexities, the overriding goal will be harmonisation of all brands, which includes those from Bajaj Auto like Pulsar, Avenger, Dominar 400 etc.
“By the end of the day, each of these bike brands should be able to meet the challenges ahead both in the domestic and export markets. This is what harmonisation represents, which means there is really no need to reinvent the wheel,” reiterates Bajaj.
Additionally, the other big challenge ahead for the Indian automotive industry is the implementation of Bharat Stage VI emission from April 2020. Not only has the country skipped BS V in the process, but the tighter timeframe between BS IV and VI will mean that companies have their work cut out in ensuring that costs are kept in check.
This is not going to be easy considering that there will be substantial investments in new technology and not all of it can be absorbed by manufacturers. Yet, passing the entire burden to customers may not be the easiest of options especially in a price-sensitive market like India. With 2020 marking new initiatives from Triumph as well as Husqvarna and Urbanite, Rajiv Bajaj may just end up being busier than usual."

 Lauding governor Urjit Patel for staunchly defending the autonomy of the central bank, industry doyen Rahul Bajaj on Thursday said government should not force its decisions on the Reserve Bank by invoking the never-used Section 7.
 He hoped that at the forthcoming board meet of the central board of the RBI on November 19, the regulator and government will reconcile by ceding some space, but made it clear that if Section 7 is invoked, Patel has no other option but to resign.
 “If government wants to stick (to its guns), then the matter will heat up. If RBI or Urijit Patel also sticks (to his own stand), and if government invokes Section 7, then it means, according to me, Patel has to resign,” he told reporters.
 “Why did Section 7 come up if you two agree? If they are not listening to you, then you (Patel) should go. I am not against Patel at all,” he said while speaking on the sidelines of the annual Jamnalal Bajaj Awards instituted by the group to recognise the work of individuals in diverse social and cultural fronts.
 As part of the reconciliation process, each side will have to cede a bit, he said, adding RBI should make concessions on two of the most contentious issues by giving more money to small businesses and liberalising the prompt corrective action framework on 11 state-run banks.
Wading into the debate started by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Bajaj said the elected Parliament is “supreme” and therefore, there is a talk of invoking Section 7, which has never been used in the RBI’s over 83-year-old history.
 “I very much hope the independence of RBI will be retained, and Section 7 will not be resorted to,” he said, adding there cannot be 100 per cent agreement at the board on certain aspects."
55,2018-11-23,Bajaj Auto,"Quadricycles for personal use get government’s green signal


The Bajaj Auto's RE60 ‘Qute’




The Bajaj Auto's RE60 ‘Qute’


Quadricycles can now be bought for personal usage, with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways notifying insertion of the item ‘Quadricycle’ as a ‘non-transport’ vehicle under the Motor Vehicles Act 1988.
“A quadricycle is a vehicle of the size of a three-wheeler but with four-tyres and is fully covered like a car. It has an engine like that of a three-wheeler. This makes it a cheap and safe mode of transport for last-mile connectivity,” a government notification said on Friday.
Though the government permitted the use of quadricycles for commercial purpose in June, the latest notification opens the door for their use for personal purpose.
Bajaj Auto is the only company that makes the vehicle named ‘Qute’, which it exports to countries like Turkey.
The company has had faced stiff resistance in its attempt get the category notified under the Motor Vehicles Act, with several PILs filed against the introduction of quadricycles.
Companies such as Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors also have plans to launch such vehicles.
However, according to analysts, the introduction of such category also raises a lot of questions about the government’s thought process. On the one hand, it is talking about road safety and the need for environment-friendly vehicles and therefore stressing on features such as ABS and airbags, and on the other, it is promoting vehicles like quadricycles which do not have such safety mechanisms, they point out.
“I don’t think a consumer will buy a quadricycle for personal use as these vehicles have low power; he will likely upgrade to other options in the passenger cars segment,” said a Delhi-based analyst.
However, quadricycles may signal the beginning of a new a era in public transportation as currently three-wheelers remain a highly unsafe mode for commuting, he said.
He added that there is a strong possibility that the shift to quadricycles may happen if the vehicles get preferential tax treatment or if the rules are relaxed, particularly for the electric/hybrid variants."

Three years ago, Bajaj Auto was facing headwinds on exports thanks to falling oil prices, the fluctuating rupee and geopolitical issues across the world.
Exports had been good for 15 years till then, before they began falling for two successive years between 2015 and 2017. “Our thinking was clear. The idea was to be counter-intuitive, which has been our strategy all along. When competition was not looking at exports in this uncertain phase, we decided to pursue it aggressively,” says Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director.
This drive saw a slew of initiatives made in Nepal, Bangladesh, Iraq, Afghanistan, Colombia, the Philippines and a host of other countries. Today, the volumes are back with a vengeance in the company’s exports business.
“Thanks to our global drive in the last two-three years, we believe exports will touch 2 million units this year. It pays to be counter-intuitive. If you follow the herd, you are lost,” adds Bajaj. From his point of view, the company is “reaping the fruits” of its vision, which is to be a global player.








 
 
The second pillar of the counter-intuitive strategy involves products, which in Bajaj Auto’s case are its motorcycles and three-wheelers. Till about a couple of years ago, things looked difficult for the domestic three-wheeler industry. There were no permits being issued while the Qute, stuck in litigation, was a non-starter in the quadricycle segment (it is now ready to hit the roads).
Yet, during this dull phase, the company focussed on its petrol engines as well as CNG, LPG and new diesels. Today, the intra-city business (as its three- and four-wheelers are also known as) has grown over 30 per cent and is tipped to touch 8,00,000 units by the end of this fiscal. Exports will take up half of these at 4,00,000 units with motorcycles accounting for the balance 1.6 million units.
“This is the second pillar of our strategy, which was to focus on the domestic intra-city market. In the process, our volumes and profitability have improved dramatically,” says Bajaj.
As for motorcycles, following the demonetisation shocker of November 2016, the company could sense that the market was softening, which meant a counter-intuitive approach was the answer. “While everyone complained that things were soft, we decided to throttle up fully,” recalls Bajaj.
The core of this counter-intuitive strategy was product and the company decided to roll out 12 motorcycles across 24 months. “We are halfway there now in this plan which includes the CT 100 and Platina as well as the sports segment comprising Pulsar and Avenger,” he says.
The commuter segment, in particular, has taken off with a bang, thanks to price cuts which have seen sales of the CT 100 and Platina soar and enhanced Bajaj Auto’s share in this category from 25 per cent to 40 per cent.
Yet, there is more to the story. “While there is a lot of noise being generated on the CT 100 and Platina, people forget the big strides taken in the sports segment, too,” says Bajaj.
In just one year, the Pulsar 150 has raced away to clock 55,000 units a month. The newly launched Pulsar NS 160 is averaging 5,000 units a month, keeping pace with its NS 200 sibling.
“In the process, our leadership in the sports segment has gone up from 38-40 per cent to 42 per cent today,” says Bajaj. In the overall motorcycle segment, the company’s share has grown from 15 to 20 per cent in a year. “Now, going into the new fiscal, there will be new additions in sports (Pulsar, Avenger and Dominar) and I will be happy if we hold on to our market share in an arena where competition is fierce,” he adds.
The other three additions will be in the CT 100 and Platina, where the company will focus on low-cost innovation.
“I hope these interventions can help grow our share in motorcycles to 25 per cent by the end of next fiscal,” says Bajaj."

48,2019-01-03,Bajaj Auto,"For Bajaj Auto, ASEAN is the next big global play


Rakesh Sharma




Rakesh Sharma


For Rakesh Sharma, there could not have been a better start to 2019.
His company, Bajaj Auto, has shown good growth in its motorcycles and three-wheelers through the first nine months of the fiscal with the last quarter also looking promising. Exports are well on course to touching two million units for 2018-19. 
And, finally, the New Year saw Sharma elevated as Executive Director of Bajaj Auto, coming close on the heels of his recent promotion as Chief Commercial Officer last year. From his point of view, though, it’s business as usual even while he admits that the tailwinds are firmly in place to take the growth story forward.
“ASEAN is the next big thing for us,” says Sharma, where the building blocks are now being put in place for countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines. According to him, the results will start to show over the next couple of years when the overall growth vision for the region will start yielding tangible results.
Bajaj and partner KTM have already announced their intent to cooperate in Indonesia for motorcycles while for other parts of ASEAN, the strategies could be more individually focussed. No concrete plans have been drawn up though Sharma says it is only natural that the two will continue to exchange notes.
After all, Bajaj holds 48 per cent in KTM and the partnership has only grown from strength to strength since the time the two came together way back in 2007. At that time, Bajaj had a 14 per cent stake, which has now grown over three-fold and will soon see Swedish brand Husqvarna join the product parade next year.
Beyond ASEAN, Shama is bullish about Bangladesh, a market in which Bajaj has been a key resident for many years now with its product offerings. What is interesting though is that India’s neighbour has been proactively working out an automotive roadmap in which two-wheelers will be an integral part of the growth plan.
“Bangladesh is clearly the star of the pack in Asia,” says Sharma, while indicating that Bajaj will now pull out all the stops to increase its share further in this market. More recently, Honda set up a new motorcycle plant in Bangladesh that clearly shows that the potential here is immense in terms of greater market penetration for two-wheelers.
Yet, it is not all rosy in Asia with Sri Lanka clearly in some sort of policy paralysis thanks in part to the political tumult seen in recent times. What is even more intriguing is that this market was seen to be more advanced than Bangladesh except that the latter is now catching up in a big way with its pragmatic approach in attracting new investments.
Likewise, continues Sharma, Latin America is not in top shape either right now with new governments suddenly turning more left of centre. In the process, the mood is more distinctly anti-business where incentives are also being knocked off in markets like Mexico, which are important to Bajaj. 
Be it Argentina or Peru, Latin America seems shaky overall thanks to these new geopolitical realities that may just end up being obstacles to growth. The million dollar question is how long the headwinds will last especially when there is turmoil all around in the form of Brexit, the US-China trade wars and so on.
The best piece of news to Sharma, though, is Africa, which accounts for 50 per cent of the company’s business and is doing brisk. “Africa is in a stable spot right now and things are in better control overall,” he says. 
This is a welcome turnaround from the not-so-distant past when Africa was in the midst of extreme volatility, especially markets like Nigeria that depend on oil revenues. There is no indication of another rollercoaster ride emerging soon, which means Bajaj can hope to strengthen its base in this market.
While Africa accounts for half of its exports business, 15 per cent comes from Latin America and 35 per cent from Asia. In this backdrop, the importance of Bangladesh assumes significance especially with Latin America being wobbly and Sri Lanka still to get back to a greater level of normalcy.
All in all, Sharma is confident that Bajaj Auto is poised to “reach good double digit growth for exports in the near term”. This could well mean that the figure could go up to 2.3 million units in 2019-20 or even higher as the ASEAN share of the pie also grows in the process. Brazil and Europe will also be on the growth radar where KTM is likely to play a strong role as Bajaj Auto’s global ally. 
Back home in India, Sharma believes that the strategy of focussing on the entry segment in motorcycles is paying off for the company in terms of building volumes for the CT100 and Platina. The other priority area is the sports segment where the Pulsar and Avenger are jointly leading the race even while efforts are on to grow the Dominar 400.
According to Sharma, it is quite evident that there is a rapidly growing base of new buyers in the entry segment, which has been borne out by the growing market response to the company’s CT100 and Platina combine. In fact, these two brands will be the engines for the next growth phase in 2019-20 where low-cost innovations will lead the way.
“Our success has been a result of smart product strategy and pricing,” says Sharma. The middle-end of the commuter motorcycle segment, in which Hero reigns supreme with the Splendor and Passion, is showing much slower growth compared to the entry and sports segments. 
If this trend continues, it will be interesting to see how leadership dynamics will change in the process while keeping in mind that Honda is the clear leader in scooters. Hero is incidentally the leader in the entry-level with its HF series, which has also been showing growth.
Even while he is bullish about growth prospects next fiscal, Sharma cautions that there could be possible disruptions coming in the next few months, more specifically from April onwards, when new safety norms in the form of ABS and CBS become mandatory for higher capacity engines. This will translate into more expensive price tags for motorcycles and it is too early to say how this will impact demand. 
It is perhaps in this context that entry-level motorcycles will get a further shot in the arm and their numbers could soar thanks to the fact that they will be more affordable. The sports segment, likewise, will continue to get its share of buyers who do not mind paying more. 
Beyond this, two-wheeler manufacturers will have another costing challenge with Bharat Stage VI emission norms becoming mandatory from April 2020. For Sharma, though, the priority would be to grow faster than this fiscal even while his company will have to contend with some serious headwinds."

Rajiv bajaj, MD, Bajaj Auto




Rajiv bajaj, MD, Bajaj Auto


 For many industrialists run-up to the budget means time to present wish lists to the government. However, for Rajiv Bajaj, the managing director of Bajaj Auto, watching budget presentation itself is a waste of time, let alone wish for any favour from the government.
Bajaj, who claims not to have watched budget presentations in the last 28 years, said Monday that he would rather spend time working on a product than waste four hours watching the budget. 
 In a candid admission at an event here, Bajaj even went a step further declaring that he won’t be watching it in future as well, as there “was nothing worthwhile” in it. 
“You will be surprised to know that in the last 28 years (that) I have been in Bajaj, I have not seen Budget even a single time,” Bajaj said when asked about his expectations from the interim Budget which is due next month.
 The Union Budget is one of the most watched, discussed and followed annual exercise in India among industry players as well as common man as it sets out the government’s fiscal policies. 
 Bajaj, however, has a different take.
“There is no benefit by watching the Budget because it does not have anything which is worthwhile and without seeing Budget it has not affected my company,” he said, adding if there were any important policy changes there would be people who would informing him “through Whatsapp” about those changes any way.
“Rather than sit for four hours and burden your brain, it is better to go and make a product. Nor I have seen it and nor I will see it in the future, you can report that,” he said to a full house of media and other company executives.
Bajaj, who is well known for speaking his mind over a range of issues whether political or business, also clarified his stand on the reduction in GST on two wheelers saying he supported the call not to treat two-wheelers as luxury items.
GST on two-wheelers
“I do concede that to call two-wheeler or a motorcycle in this country a luxury item doesn’t have a logic. It is not a luxury item...If 28 per cent tax is for luxury items and 18 per cent is for normal items then logically it seems to me that 18 per cent (for two-wheelers) make sense,” Bajaj said.
He further said, “My personal opinion is that any motorcycle up to 250 cc is a mass motorcycle and I would say all such bikes are being bought by people basically for commuting. It is not that you will be taking a 150 cc bike for racing.” 
While expressing his difference of opinion with other two-wheeler makers who wanted a cut in GST rate on two-wheelers in the wake of decline in sales in the past three months, Bajaj said keeping in mind cost escalations due to implementation of safety norms and upcoming BS-VI, there was indeed a need to rationalise the rate.
“Since safety norms will be coming this year and emission norms next year and between these two the average 150 cc bike, we should expect the prices to go up by around Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000. So if there is going to be such a steep increase, we will have to pass it on, most of it, not all of it. 
“So if the government were to take a kind view of this and mitigate some of the the cost increase by adjusting the GST at that time, to me that seems to me a logical thing,” Bajaj said.
Earlier, Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor Company had asked the government to slash GST on two wheelers from the current 28 per cent slab to 18 per cent to give relief to the customers."

After more than four decades of ‘Humara Bajaj’ tagline of Bajaj Auto, the company on Monday released its new identity as ‘The World’s Favourite Indian’ as it achieved dramatic transition from a domestic scooter maker to a global motorcycle powerhouse in 17 years.
The launch of the Pulsar from its Chakan plant in 2001 marked the beginning of this interesting global ride, the company said, adding that building on its ‘Humara Bajaj’ roots of providing reliable mobility solutions, Bajaj Auto has invested a lot in technology and innovation to design motorcycles that are loved not only in India but 70 countries around the world.
The retail showrooms will also undergo a transformation with new signage and branding in line with the message of ‘The World’s Favourite Indian’, the company said.
“Our international performance is validation of our strategy of focus and differentiation. Our unwavering commitment towards building the best motorcycles in the world through design, technology, quality and customer satisfaction has made us a truly global brand,” Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, Bajaj Auto, said here. 
He said since the launch of Pulsar 17 years back, the company has become the third-largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world, ahead of several Japanese and European brands that have been around for much longer. 
“In any market around the world, when people think of motorcycles, they should think of Bajaj. That will help us achieve our vision of being a Global Motorcycle Specialist,” Bajaj said. 
Asked about future products including electric vehicles, he said Electric Qute (quadricycle) and electric three-wheelers are very much on the company’s agenda. But that said, Bajaj Auto needs to think about not only India, but also for many other markets in the world."

Bajaj Auto (Reduce)
CMP: ₹2,553.35
Target: ₹2,362
Bajaj Auto’s strategy to gain market share in the domestic motorcycle segment might have provided the company and its dealers much-needed volumes but at the cost of profitability and margins. Management expects to continue with this aggressive pricing strategy and consumer offers in the low-margin domestic M1 motorcycle segment. Given no incremental growth expected in the domestic three-wheeler market and slight disruption in the premium segment due to increase in cost on account of safety norms, margins would continue to be under pressure. 
Key takeaways from the concall: Margins were impacted sequentially by lower USD realisation (at ₹68.9 v/s ₹69.4 in Q2-FY19), lower CV volumes (at 181K units v/s 213K units in Q2FY19) and unabsorbed material costs and unfavourable product mix in exports to the tune of 100 bps, 40 bps and 40 bps, respectively; Q1 FY20 export margins are expected to be higher by 1-1.5 per cent on the back of better USD realisation to come in that quarter; margins are expected to be higher by nearly 80 bps by Q1 FY20 from current Q3 FY18 levels; current inventory levels are higher at nearly six weeks; and domestic 3Ws are expected to be higher nearly 10 per cent QoQ in Q4 FY19 but lower YoY at 100K units."

41,2019-02-14,Bajaj Auto,"How the script was drafted for Bajaj Auto’s new global avatar


Sumeet Narang, Vice-President, Urbanite Businesss




Sumeet Narang, Vice-President, Urbanite Businesss


When Sumeet Narang tells you that he jokingly refers to the 1980s’ Hamara Bajaj ad as the Sholay of advertising, he is actually spot-on.
“You cannot make another Sholay, right? Likewise, for this ad, enough can be written about what made it so iconic,” says Bajaj Auto’s Vice-President — Urbanite Business. Today, even while the new campaign (The World’s Favorite Indian) is being splashed across the landscape right from print and TV to the company’s plants and dealerships, nostalgia is in the air all over again for Hamara Bajaj. 
“It is about putting together a new narrative around the brand for what it has been known by over the years,” says Narang who was closely involved with the new campaign. It clearly signals the evolution of the company, which has now come a long way since the Chetak days when it was the monarch of the geared scooter space.
Three decades ago, when the Hamara Bajaj ad had literally become a part of all Indian households, it pretty much encapsulated what the Bajaj brand already meant to a lot of people. For India of the late 1980s, the Chetak was the first choice for mobility. In the process, it set the roots for Bajaj Auto as a brand in terms of what it was known for (value, trust, reliability, credibility, etc).
Incidentally, a lot of advertising in the 1980s was glamorous, aspirational, westernised and largely in English. The Hamara Bajaj campaign caught the whole slice of life as well as an acceptance of the Indian flavour. 
Today, the same company has exited scooters and is a specialist in motorcycles, which are sold both here and abroad. The Chetak is only a distant memory and the stable now has an array of motorcycle brands. The shift was inevitable when geared scooters lost momentum in the market.
“When the Pulsar was launched in 2001, the company began transforming itself significantly. It also marked a dramatic shift from scooters to motorcycles,” says Narang. The strategy of focus on one category (motorcycles) and differentiation for every product and brand has been the cornerstone for the last two decades now. 
Bajaj Auto changed completely as also the product line-up in terms of technology, styling, innovation, design, etc. “We were aware that the business and the reality around our products were way ahead of brand perception,” says Narang. 
Perception, of course, takes time to evolve and the team at Bajaj realised it was important to take this message to customers and tell them that here was a brand trusted in India and across the world. This would then become a big value-add to those looking to buy a quality motorcycle. 
Over the last many years, the focus within Bajaj was clearly on building individual product brands like the Pulsar, Discover, Avenger, ‘V’, Dominar and Platina. It was important to differentiate them right from the most affordable to the top-end motorcycle and this is where the ‘Distinctly Ahead’ tagline played its role in communicating the intent.
However, the time had now come to get back to the Bajaj mother brand after the evolution of these products both here and in overseas markets. “We wanted to invest in terms of bringing in a new identity, narrative and telling people what the brand truly stands for,” says Narang. 
From the messaging point of view, it was important to add a new narrative/identity around the brand without any change to the ‘Flying Bee’ logo. As he reiterates, it is crucial to have one’s priorities clear in marketing since “there will be a whole lot of areas to invest in than what you actually can”. 
Three decades ago, when the Hamara Bajaj campaign was launched, the facts were on the table and it was a summation of all of them. “Today, with The World’s Favourite Indian, the facts and numbers have been achieved and we have packaged it to customers. It is a much better reflection of what the brand has already achieved today,” says Narang.
There was, of course, a lot of hard work in preparing for the new campaign. The message had to be kept simple (as is the case of any good campaign) and the idea was to deliver it dramatically while tugging at the heartstrings. 
“We are still very clear about the fact that if someone wants a Pulsar, Avenger or Platina, his inspiration or motivation comes from what the product stands for,” reiterates Narang. While the Bajaj Auto association is “definitely comforting”, it is the individual brand that will attract the customer. Hence, going forward, each product and brand will need to stand up for itself to draw the targeted user. 
“There is no change in our belief and it is about a strong differentiated portfolio. With the kind of salience that our products have enjoyed in the marketplace along with our investments in them, the bigger association that comes to people’s minds is the motorcycle(s) as opposed to any other category,” says Narang. 
He also makes it clear that the team at Bajaj has always believed in experimenting and learning from real life experiences rather than marketing philosophies. “We do realise that the mother and product brand have a role to play and the relationship between the two has come across very clearly to us over a period of time,” he says. 
Through the new campaign, the endeavour is to focus on the relationship “and this is how we learn from experience and experimentation”. Narang also thinks it is too academic to define which is more/less important — the mother or product brand. It is his belief that the Bajaj brand name earned its respect and trust because of the products sold over the years. 
“In markets where the Pulsar is doing very well and where we launched the Dominar, the common link is the Bajaj brand. It is a symbiotic kind of relationship and I feel the mother brand needs to be talked about now,” says Narang.
Given that the company has focussed on innovation, technology, styling and design as differentiators, it was now obvious that there needed to be a narrative for the mother brand to go hand-in-hand with this story and take it ahead. “The Bajaj brand has always stood for trust, reliability and value but it has moved beyond that,” he explains.
As part of the drive, there will be a change in visual identity at all Bajaj dealerships over the next three months along with new signages, facia and graphics inside the showrooms. “It is early days yet to gauge customer impact and we would rather be humble and wait,” reasons Narang. 
The underlying message to any customer is that if he is keen on buying a global bike, he has come to the right place. “In today’s rapidly globalising world, even small towns have people who know a lot about brands that are respected across the world,” he adds. 
Narang also makes it clear that there is no patriotic angle to this campaign. The feedback coming in on social media shows that customers are proud that an Indian brand has achieved so much. “There is a lot of brand love coming in too from those who love their bikes and are rooting for us,” he says."
40,2019-02-14,Bajaj Auto,"When Platina pitched in during the Kumbh Mela
The ongoing Kumbh Mela is the largest congregation in the world held on the banks of the Ganga. However, the veritable melting pot of pilgrims could prove to be a tsunami of chaos for the elderly/disabled and a crowded nightmare for others. 
It is here that advertising major Ogilvy, and Bajaj Auto saw an opportunity where the Platina ComforTec 110 motorcycle could make a difference. “We asked the Kumbh authorities how brands could participate and were told transportation and sanitation were some of the major aspects where brands could pitch in,” recalls Sukesh Nayak, Chief Creative Officer, Ogilvy West. 
“We then opened the brief to all teams to understand which brand message could fit in. Bajaj Platina had a perfect fit,” he adds. This clearly was an opportunity that could not be passed up. Accordingly, Platina would steer “the largest gathering of people who have one dream of taking a holy dip”. Ogilvy and Bajaj ideated and retrofitted some 40-50 Platinas with custom-designed backrests to support the pillion for added safety.
This backrest was engineered keeping the one-sided seating specially suited for saree-clad women. The Platina ComforTec 110 Aaram Rath had made its debut. Each Platina has a rider and old pilgrims are being ferried as pillions along the route allotted, from the Phaphamau Bus Stand to Naagvasuki Temple, Prayagraj, to the Sangam Nose, which is a confluence of three sacred rivers, or the bathing ghats for a dip. The pilgrims are also taken back to the spot from where they are picked up, or to the bus stop on the outskirts of Kumbh, which connects the whole of Prayagraj to the Kumbh City.
Narayan Sundararaman, Vice President, Bajaj Auto says the new Bajaj Platina Comfortec 110 strives to deliver the most comfortable ride experience in the category. “Platina essentially stands for comfort and we were clear that this activity would bring relief to people in need of help to reach the ghats,” he says. 
The entire campaign took almost 50 days to put together. The brief to the ad agency was clear: “Let’s help the pilgrims on their journey and not showcase ourselves. Rather than blatantly selling the brand’s strengths, the idea was to ease pilgrims’ pain,” reminisces Nayak.
VR Rajesh, Office Leader, Ogilvy India (West) maintains it is not often that an opportunity of this scale and nature opens up. “Kumbh Mela attracts people of myriad backgrounds and geographies. 
The locales and crowds make it very difficult for devotees to access different parts of the city and ghats,” he adds.
Terming it “a simple ferry service to the elderly,” Sukesh Nayak adds, “We have played an important role as a partner. This is not a brand campaign at the largest gathering of humanity. Yes, it is a place where our consumers are and where we can connect with them.” 
He goes on, “With all the Platinas ferrying pilgrims, we have a live billboard going up and down the Kumbh. But this is not a sales pitch. What we have done instead is contribute in a small way to our consumers’ special journey.”"
39,2019-02-24,Bajaj Auto,"Piaggio aims to scale up two-wheeler biz in India 
 Italian two-wheeler maker Piaggio is looking to expand its sales network in India to over 350 dealerships by the end of this year as part of scaling up its business in the country, a top company official said.
 The company, which currently has around 250 sales outlets, will however stick to its premium lineage even as it seeks to grow its volume in the world’s largest two-wheeler market as it does not want to be perceived as mass segment player.
“We plan to expand our volumes in both domestic and export markets. Currently, our sales network is very limited (in India) as we are one of the last players to come on board here,” said Diego Graffi Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Piaggio Vehicles India.
There is huge area in India where the company is not present in terms of sales network, he said adding that it has only been 6 years since the company re-entered the country.
“Through this expansion of sales network, we plan to expand our presence...we are planning to have 350 active dealerships by the end of this year,” Graffi said.
 When asked if the company would like to compete with mass market players in the country, Graffi said: “Wherever we are present all across the world in the two-wheeler space, we do not want to be perceived as a mass segment player.”
He further said, “We are not interested in that (mass segment). We are not interested in market share...we are among the top when it comes to brand recall...that is what we are looking at.” 
The company, which sells Vespa and Aprilia brands in the country, sold 74,704 units in India in 2017-18. Piaggio has a manufacturing plant in Baramati in Maharashtra, where it manufactures the iconic Vespa alongside the Aprilia SR 150.
 Graffi also supported the call for reduction in GST on two wheelers.
“In two-wheelers, we have seen a lot of challenges starting from mandatory third-party insurance which came into force from September 2018...then we have new legislations like mandatory usage of ABS from April 2019,” Graffi said.
 Then there is BS-VI challenge as well, so due to all these factors, the industry is going to provide better service, content, safety to consumer, he added.
“So, my idea is that reduction of GST rates on two-wheelers from 28 per cent to 18 per cent is quite recommendable from even our point of view,” Graffi noted.
 The company sees two-wheelers as a normal medium of mass transportation and “we don’t see having such high GST applied (on the segment), he added.
 Earlier, Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor Company had asked the government to slash GST on two-wheelers from the current 28 per cent slab to 18 per cent to give relief to the customers."

34,2019-03-28,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj hits the bull’s-eye with its ‘invading the middle’ strategy


Sound plan: Rajiv Bajaj says that his company has outpaced the industry with its strategy KAMAL NARANG




Sound plan: Rajiv Bajaj says that his company has outpaced the industry with its strategy KAMAL NARANG


With two days to go before the current fiscal draws to a close, Rajiv Bajaj will have reasons to feel pleased. His company has displayed a remarkable resurgence in motorcycles where the centre of gravity within the industry has now shifted quickly to the entry segment.
As the Managing Director of Bajaj Auto says, this is clearly due to the CT 100 and Platina blitzkrieg that has intensified pressure on the executive commuter category dominated by Hero MotoCorp.
Of course, Hero has its own HF range that leads the entry segment but there is really little doubt that Bajaj Auto’s CT 100 and Platina combine have redefined the dynamics here. After all, it was this very product space that was languishing at 18 per cent of the overall motorcycle market three years, down from a dominating 39 per cent in 2006.
The entry segment has now staged an astonishing comeback and its share last year stood at 35 per cent. As Bajaj says, this kind of a segment shift (from the executive commuter) is unheard of. 
Sure, there is no question that price played a big role in drawing buyers to the entry space but, from the company’s point of view, it could afford to do so in order to build market share.
After all, the more profitable Pulsar has been growing year-on-year and drawn customers largely from the 125 cc space. As a result, the pricier sports segment has grown from 18 to 25 per cent of the motorcycle segment in just one year. “Our strategy of ‘invading the middle’ is paying off and has contributed to volumes and profitability,” says Bajaj. In the process, the mid/executive commuter segment, in which the Splendor has been the monarch for decades, has clearly shrunk.
“When skating on thin ice, your safety is in your speed.. thus we moved at lighting speed since March last year and have outpaced the industry,” adds Bajaj. The company now intends to keep up the pressure and the first quarter of next fiscal will see three new products — CT, Platina and Pulsar — which will take the growth story forward.
“We believe the entry bike segment will grow to 40 per cent and the sports to 35 per cent,” says Bajaj. If things go according to plan, he is confident that Bajaj Auto’s share in domestic motorcycles will also grow from the present 20-odd per cent to 25-30 per cent. “We did well as we played to our strengths... our strong brands in the entry and sports segments,” says Bajaj. “We did so because gaining intra-segment share is always easy but often unsustainable.. when you gain inter-segment share, as we have with CT 100, Platina and Pulsar invading the middle, such gain is much harder for competition to negate.”
It is also evident that Bajaj Auto has pretty much decided to keep its focus confined to these three brands, which are clearly its biggest growth engines. The Platina is also gradually climbing the ladder as a value proposition while the more affordable CT 100 is playing out its part to perfection in the entry space.
The Pulsar, of course, has been the company’s flagship brand for 18 years now with the Avenger and Dominar 400 complementing the premium range. With the focus on the entry and sports segments now paying off rich dividends, Bajaj believes it is important to build on this momentum. Does this mean that brands like Discover and ‘V’ will now be relegated to the sidelines? From his point of view, it makes sense to take one thing at a time. For now, it clearly makes sense to prioritise the CT100, Platina and Pulsar but when the time comes, there will be reason to revisit brands like ‘V’ and build on their potential. It will be interesting to see how the imminent motorcycle tug-of-war pans out in the coming months. Hero will doubtless be keen to retain its leadership position with Splendor and will pull out all the stops to ensure that this objective is achieved. 
It is still the leading player in the overall two-wheeler arena even while erstwhile partner, Honda, has emerged its fiercest rival with its Activa scooter. Bajaj has, of course, chosen to focus on motorcycles while steering clear of scooters where it was once the undisputed monarch. The company has attempted to upset the Hero applecart over the years with differentiated products like Discover and ‘V’ in the executive commuter space. Yet, Splendor has comfortably lasted all these years even after Hero parted ways with Honda.
Bajaj is clearly betting big on the new strategy for the entry and sports segment, which has worked like a charm thus far. Bajaj is quite confident that the growth story will continue through this fiscal, which means the dynamics in the executive commuter space could change if it were to come under more pressure.
What would this mean for Splendor? Will it manage to weather the storm or will Hero come out tops as it generally has? These are interesting times for the two-wheeler industry which is up against a host of challenges in the form of new safety norms that come into effect from April 1 and Bharat Stage VI emission norms due to be mandatory a year from now."
33,2019-03-28,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj, KTM all set to deepen bonding
Last week saw an interesting update on the Bajaj Auto-KTM partnership where plans are underway to effect a change in the existing equity structure.
Bajaj, which holds 48 per cent in KTM AG, is now looking at transferring this component to the parent company, KTM Industrie, where Pierer Industrie holds 62 per cent. In the process, the parent company’s stake in KTM AG will be up from 51.7 to 99.7 per cent.
What does this mean for Bajaj Auto? Holding a stake in the parent could mean leveraging more opportunities with its partner in the global arena, which is seeing massive mobility disruptions. In the process, this will signal a deeper bonding between the two companies. 
It was back in 2007 when Bajaj acquired a 14 per cent stake in KTM that has since grown to 48 per cent. Beyond the equity component, the two have built an edifice of trust and faith, which has seen KTM farm out production responsibilities of lower displacement engine Duke motorcycles to Bajaj.
These are produced at the Chakan plant and exported to a host of countries across the world. The next phase of the partnership will now see some Husqvarna bike models also made at Chakan and shipped out to other regions. KTM had acquired this Swedish brand from BMW Motorrad five years ago and has worked successfully towards its revival.
Bajaj has also forged an alliance with Triumph of the UK, which will see mid-capacity motorcycles manufactured in Chakan and exported to other markets. The first model is scheduled to roll out in 2021 and it will be interesting to see how the new powerhouse in the form of Bajaj-KTM along with Triumph draft their growth blueprint for the following decade."

30,2019-04-18,Bajaj Auto,"For Bajaj Auto, it’s one step at a time with Qute
Over the last month, Prashant R Ahir and his team at Bajaj Auto have been on a Bharat Darshan of sorts with Qute. Since March 15, the quadricycle has entered Kerala, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa with Maharashtra being the latest addition on Thursday. As DGM (Business Planning), Intracity Business Unit, Ahir is quite excited about Qute’s prospects in India though these are early days yet. However, there is reason to feel optimistic at least going by the initial feedback coming in from Kerala where users have given the thumbs up to the quadricycle for its easy manoeuvrability on the State’s narrow roads. The other positive is its mileage at 35 kmpl, which is ideal for commercial applications.
As Ahir says in a phone interview from Pune, Qute is a segment creator of sorts since there is no other vehicle of its type present now in the country. Bajaj Auto has had to wait for six years since the time it first showcased it as the RE60 at the 2012 Auto Expo. Today, it has been given the go-ahead for use on Indian roads but this will still involve getting individual approvals from Regional Transport Offices across different States. “As an intracity commuting option, Qute is the best bet,” reiterates Ahir. As he says, it is a 216 cc vehicle that is much lighter than a car and whose speed is restricted to 30 kmph. In crowded cities, it is safer than a three-wheeled autorickshaw and more economical to use than a car.
Further, continues Ahir, there is the added advantage of compressed natural gas (CNG) as an alternative fuel option which is already available in two of its markets: Gujarat and Maharashtra. The CNG Qute can deliver up to 45 km/kg which is even more economical than petrol-driven scooters and motorcycles.
Access to CNG, however, is still confined to a handful of States, including Delhi, but the Centre has big plans to spread its reach. It is also evident in the passenger car space that diesel is slowly yielding to petrol ever since its subsidy element has been removed and it has become pricier in the process.
Trends like these give Ahir and his team at Bajaj Auto the confidence that there is tremendous potential for Qute even while it is still a learning experience for them. “We are telling people to test it, touch and feel it since this is the only way to get familiar with an all-new offering,” he says. In the process, interested users could find some new applications coming in from Qute which, in turn, will be useful inputs to its manufacturer too. These could be both in the personal and commercial space where the biggest benefit is clearly the cost of ownership.
Ahir believes that some potential customers could include a section of autorickshaw drivers who have been around for years and are keen on graduating to something bigger. They cannot afford to buy a taxi but Qute will be within their reach. Likewise, there could be the conventional black-and-yellow taxi drivers who are not owners but drawing a salary. To them, something like Qute may just end up being an attractive lateral move. It will be easy on their pockets both from the viewpoint of acquisition and operating costs.
In Ahir’s view, there could be more takers for Qute’s commercial applications given that it is about operating costs by the end of the day. On the other hand, a two-wheeler rider may be more inclined to graduating to a car or stay content with his scooter or motorcycle. Likewise, a car user will not shift to a quadricycle and, at best, the personal space will see applications for short distances like dropping kids to school and so on. As Ahir says, it will take time for people to take to Qute and volumes will gradually grow with market acceptance.
Going forward, Bajaj Auto plans to launch the quadricycle in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Bihar and the North East. Once RTO approvals come in for other States like Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh, Qute will have made a much larger national footprint. The next challenge is to grow the buyer base and generate volumes."

23,2019-06-10,Bajaj Auto,"Two-wheeler makers term EV switchover by 2025 as ‘impractical’


Auto industry body SIAM has also advised the government to follow a well laid-out roadmap




Auto industry body SIAM has also advised the government to follow a well laid-out roadmap


 Leading two-wheeler makers Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company said Monday that any plan to ban internal combustion engine three-wheelers and two-wheelers to adopt electric ones by 2025 would be “unrealistic” and “ill-timed” and derail auto manufacturing in the country.
 The comments come in response to some media reports that the government was considering a proposal to ban sale of internal combustion engine (ICE) three-wheelers by 2023 and less than 150 cc two-wheelers by 2025.
 Auto industry body SIAM has also advised the government to follow a well laid-out roadmap and a practical time frame for the rollout of electric vehicles (EVs) in the country.
 Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj in a statement Monday termed the reported government’s plan as impractical and ill-timed.
 He listed out three execution-related concerns with the reported initiative.
“First that it may be impractical to target such a scale when none of the stakeholders currently possesses any meaningful experience with any of the pieces of the electric vehicle (EV) puzzle,” Bajaj noted.
 Secondly, it is ill-timed to target a date so close to BSVI implementation, he added.
“And finally, to target two and three wheelers but not cars etc makes it an incomplete initiative,” Bajaj said.
 He added that an appropriate middle path would be in the first phase to target such a changeover through corporate average fuel efficiency (CAFE) norms, electric vehicles for all vehicle categories from a particular date such as 2023 or 2025 starting with the most polluted cities of India.
“Basis the learnings from that experience a collective plan can be put together to scale up as desired,” Bajaj said.
 TVS Motor Company Chairman Venu Srinivasan said, “To force an unrealistic deadline for mass adoption of electric two and three wheelers, will not just create consumer discontent, it risks derailing auto-manufacturing in India that supports 4 million jobs.” 
There is a need for gradual and seamless adoption of EVs to avoid such collateral damage and ensure our technology-driven disruption is positive and lasting, he added.
“We have been doing serious development work to ensure we can offer a mass market EV product that delivers on safety and high performance. This is necessary to co-opt consumers into making a switch, so it’s driven by consumer willingness and, therefore, adopted easily and widely. The supporting infrastructure for charging also needs to be as robust as conventional fuel options.” 
The auto industry globally is still a long way away from all of this, as is India, he highlighted.
 Industry chamber CII on Sunday said the government should carry out wider consultations before finalisation of goals and time lines for electric mobility."

Personal mobility major Uber on Thursday announced a partnership with Bajaj Auto to launch Bajaj Qute on UberXS for quick, affordable and smart urban commuting.
The Bajaj Qute is a driver-plus three passenger quadricycle. The four-wheeled motor vehicle is smaller and lighter than a passenger car. Qute comes with two fuel options — CNG and Petrol. All units available as UberXS rides will be powered by the eco-friendly CNG fuel option, which provides a mileage of 43 km/kg and makes urban commuting more environment-friendly and affordable.
 
UberXS is a brand-new category in the India-SA region and will initially offer Bajaj Qute exclusively in Bengaluru.
Nandini Maheshwari, Head, Business Development, Uber India & South Asia, said, “We are delighted to partner with one of India’s most trusted names, Bajaj Auto, to launch Bajaj Qute on UberXS in Bengaluru. This partnership is an extension of Uber’s commitment towards lowering transportation costs, enhancing asset utilization and improving rider convenience.”
Uber has recently collaborated with Yulu in Bengaluru to offer e-bikes for reducing congestion and promoting more eco-friendly travel for everyday urban commuters.
“Bajaj Qute is the first quadricycle of India. It will prove to be an ideal solution for the mobility challenges of congestion and pollution arising from rapid urbanisation. Powered by a lightweight 216 cc 4-valve water-cooled DTSi engine with closed loop fuel injection system it will result in higher fuel efficiency,” said Samardeep Subandh, Senior Vice-President, Bajaj Auto."
21,2019-06-14,Bajaj Auto,"Future shock: Latest directive on e-bikes raises hackles of two-wheeler companies
The message was one of solidarity. 
Earlier this week, there were two no-nonsense press statements issued by Rajiv Bajaj and Venu Srinivasan on the same day. They were reacting to the Centre’s proposed move to have 100 per cent electrification for three-wheelers and sub-150 cc two-wheelers by 2023 and 2025 respectively.
The Managing Director of Bajaj Auto and the Chairman of TVS Motor represent companies that are fierce rivals in the market. Yet, there was consensus on this latest notification that it was unrealistic and fraught with risks for the industry.
Both Srinivasan and Bajaj made no bones about the fact that this goalpost was impractical especially in a country which is grappling with power shortages in many parts. Both CEOs welcomed the shift to electric but warned that this was not the way to go about it in an ad hoc manner.
What was even more interesting was that the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) had also made it clear in its own statement issued a day earlier that this latest move on electrification was really a tall order. Market leader Hero MotoCorp reacted later and pretty much stayed on the same page as its predecessors as did Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India.
The notification on electrification is of course bizarre but not entirely unsurprising considering that there have been similar goals outlined in the not-so-distant past. The think-tanks in the Government had proclaimed earlier of striving for 100 per cent electric in the automotive ecosystem by 2030.
Even while stakeholders in the auto industry baulked and privately admitted that this was near impossible, the target was quietly rolled back to 40-odd per cent. Even that seems unrealistic especially when China, which is leading the rest of the world in e-mobility, has not aimed for such a lofty figure.
Disruption seems to have become a fashionable word today but this needs to be backed by sound logic and a realistic assessment of ground realties. Can charging infrastructure and power supply be actually conceived for every nook and corner of India? Can bikes on hilly terrain access power points at the drop of a hat? 
It is a classic case of putting the cart before the horse. Nobody is arguing that electric is not a noble ambition but it is equally important to acknowledge that the auto industry already has its hands full with the transition to Bharat Stage VI emission norms. 
There is tremendous work happening across the plants of vehicle manufacturers and ancillary suppliers where a lot of careful planning needs to go into framing the timetable of phasing out the current BS IV products and bringing in the new BS VI range. Additionally, there are concerns about availability of fuel especially when this has been an issue in previous emission transition efforts.
More importantly, the industry is facing one of its most severe slowdowns in recent times when customers are just not buying any products. One of the key reasons is the tight liquidity crunch in the market thanks to NBFCs putting the squeeze on lending. Urban demand is slowing down while rural India is grappling with a host of challenges on access to funds, waster scarcity and so on.
What is even more disturbing is that nobody has a clue when things will actually begin looking up. In this backdrop, it is very likely that the latest notification on the electrification goals for two and three-wheelers must have literally been the last straw for the industry.
It is welcome to see stakeholders speak in one voice and pretty much convey the message that they are not going to play ball this time. Not too long ago, it was okay for a politician to speak of bulldozing the industry while stakeholders merely heard him out. Clearly, this is not the case any longer and industry has decided that enough is enough.
There are hardcore realities to reckon with while framing such ambitious goals. As already mentioned earlier, the top priority for everyone across the automotive ecosystem is meeting the BS VI deadline. There is just no way they can afford to be saddled with BS IV stocks on April 1, 2020 since it would be just worthless junk by the end of the day.
The market is not in the greatest of shape and it would be naive to assume that it will start picking up pace during the BS VI era. Manufacturers, in reality, are reconciling themselves to the fact that demand will be tepid considering that products will be a lot more expensive. 
After all, technology does not come cheap and all costs incurred can only be recovered from the customer. It would be foolhardy to assume that companies are going to subsidise their products and absorb losses. This is hardcore business and not some charity ball where people can queue up for big bargains.
The silver lining in the cloud is that once the BS VI shock has been absorbed, customers will gradually get used to the new regime. It will also be the best piece of news to the environment especially in those metros, which head the worst list of polluters. The auto industry knows this only too well even if it means that sales could be impacted in the early phase.
Why then this rush for electric is the million dollar question? Don’t the policy makers in New Delhi realise that this is easier said than done? Let the industry settle down to a routine first in the BS VI era. After all, it is important during this time to study customer reactions, fine-tune products, plan for greater localisation, keener price strategies and so on. None of this can be done overnight, it is hard work which will go on for a long while.
On the other hand, going by the notification on electric, three-wheelers will only have breathing time of two years in the BS VI ecosystem before they go though another churn. Two-wheelers, which take up a lion’s share of the annual production of 21 million-plus units, will also need to be converted two years later in order to meet the 2025 deadline. 
This is truly bizarre in terms of policy planning and small wonder then that the likes of Srinivasan and Bajaj were prompted to react in the way they did. What the think-tanks in government need to do is to seek industry’s views and then work in tandem towards a solution. 
It is just not the manufacturers who will face the heat in this quick-fire transition to electric. Suppliers specialising in making parts for internal combustion engines have to reboot their skills for electric now. 
This is clearly impossible given the levels of competencies coupled with the reality that a whole lot of them will be out of business in the bargain. Jobs will be lost because the manpower requirements for electric will be a lot more different and highly skilled people will not be easy to find either.
Dealers will also be under pressure because the conventional model of retailing could change with electric. Perhaps there will be no need for large showrooms and bikes/scooters could even be displayed at malls. Parts could be ordered online and the idea of the traditional aftermarket, as it exists today, may just go out of the window.
World over, auto-makers are finding it a huge challenge to move to electric. Some of the biggest names in the business are struggling to find talent and are looking for alliances in order to share investments and cut back on risks. How on earth can Indian companies be different and create new benchmarks in time? Hopefully, this idea will be buried as was the overambitious vision in going 100 per cent electric by 2030."

Bajaj Auto’s market share in motorcycles is on a northward trajectory, according to the company’s Chairman Rahul Bajaj.
“First — and this pleases me no end — with a combination of well styled, appealing products and astute pricing, Bajaj Auto has begun to grow its domestic market share in motorcycles. In the course of a single year, FY19, the company succeeded in increasing its domestic sale of motorcycles by almost 29 per cent, and, in the process, grew its market share by 3 percentage points to 18.7 per cent. In fact, for March 2019, the market share exceeded 20 per cent,” he said in the company’s latest annual report.
“We are seeing the beginning of a trend that will continue to increase Bajaj Auto’s share of motorcycles in the domestic market and, in doing so, take Bajaj Auto to a place that behoves its presence,” he added.
Bajaj said that in FY19, the company exported more than 2 million motorcycles, three-wheelers plus its new quadricycle, the Qute, to 79 countries. This is a landmark achievement and represents a growth of 25 per cent over the previous year, he added.
The company has grown to become India’s No 1 motorcycle exporter — with two out of three bikes carrying a Bajaj badge, he pointed out.
“Over 40 per cent of our revenues now come from international markets,” observed Bajaj.
He further said the company’s global sales have earned over $13 billion of foreign exchange over the past decade. And, in FY19, Bajaj Auto achieved two prominent milestones — total sales of 5 million units, of which 2 million were international sales — said the Chairman.
The company’s performance in the three-wheeler space was impressive, said Bajaj.
In FY19, its overall three-wheeler sales grew more than 22 per cent to reach an all-time high. Much of this growth was driven by an impressive 43 per cent growth in exports, he observed.
Bajaj Auto accounted for almost 57 per cent of total three-wheeler sales in India, and two-thirds of total sales to the export markets.
“As far as Bajaj Auto is concerned, each of our motorcycles, three-wheelers and quadricycles will be fully BS-VI compliant not just on 1 April, 2020, but some months earlier,” said the report.
“We expect the domestic market to get more competitive across the various segments. The days when a manufacturer could claim a quasi-monopolistic presence in one or more segment is rapidly coming to an end. Given the operational nimbleness that we have demonstrated over the last couple of years, and armed with a surplus of over ₹16,000 crore, we at Bajaj Auto have the strength to deal with such competition,” it added."

Weathering the storm: Rajiv Bajaj, MD, believes that the company has played to its strengths
   -  Paul Noronha


It was sometime last week when an unusual protest took place outside the Bajaj Auto facility at Akurdi near Pune.
The protesters represented the city’s barbers association. They were upset about the company’s advertisement on the recently launched Platina 110 H Gear which, they felt, was not exactly flattering to their community. They demanded that the commercial be withdrawn.
For the record, the ad shows the rider getting a smooth shave from his barber seated behind even while the Platina weaves in and out of traffic. Clearly, the message was to drive home the smooth ride even while it ruffled feathers of the barber community.
While this was an unexpected reaction, the bigger story here is the Platina’s rapid growth story, which is part of a carefully thought out business strategy. Along with its siblings in the Bajaj Auto stable, CT100 and Pulsar, Platina is weaving a successful script for the company.
Clearly, things are working according to plan going by what the stock markets have to say. Data shows that every other auto brand has seen a huge erosion in market capitalisation year-on-year with the fall ranging from 28 per cent to 57 per cent. This is not entirely surprising given the state of the market and how auto companies are struggling to cope with the headwinds.
Yet, amidst this list, it is only Bajaj Auto that is in the positive zone, which is quite something during these troubled times when plant shutdowns have become the order of the day. Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, is naturally pleased that the company has outperformed many others and reiterates that all this is a result of a carefully thought out strategy paying rich dividends.
There are three key pillars that form part of this plan, of which the first is segment innovation in the domestic motorcycle space. The exercise kicked off in April last year and the results clearly indicate that the company has been successful with brands such as the CT100, Pulsar, Avenger, and Platina. Market share in motorcycles grew to 20 per cent last fiscal and the momentum is still in place even while there is a clear bloodbath all around.
The last month has seen the launch of the CT110 and Platina 110 H Gear (which featured the smooth shave commercial) and Bajaj is confident that the growth story will continue. He is especially upbeat about the more recent entrant, Pulsar 125, where the impact will be more visible from September. The company’s internal target is to increase its overall domestic market share in motorcycles to 25 per cent by the end of this fiscal, which will then mark a significant jump from last year’s level. “All this is happening thanks to segment innovation,” reiterates Bajaj.
However, is there a possibility of brand Pulsar being diluted because of the new 125 cc avatar, which is a detour from its more powerful 150 cc-plus range? Its MD does not subscribe to this thinking. He points to the KTM 125, which is manufactured at the Chakan plant near Pune and exported across the world.
KTM is the Austrian bike brand in which Bajaj Auto has a 48 per cent stake. It has expanded its portfolio to include lower engine displacement bikes like the KTM 125, which are made in India and shipped out to other countries.
Bajaj makes clear that there is no brand dilution in the KTM 125 just because of the smaller engine. “When you introduce a KTM 125, it should be a KTM and just not another 125 cc bike,” he explains while driving home the point that the brand DNA is still intact.
The same analogy holds good for the Pulsar 125 and Bajaj is keeping a careful eye on market feedback. For instance, he was “thrilled to hear” that people said it feels like a 150 cc and not a 125 cc motorcycle.
The MD is also is all praise for the R&D team, which has “done wonderful work” in ensuring that the Pulsar 125 is one of a kind that will not feel like any other 125 cc motorcycle in the market. More technology has gone into this bike, which will mean a premium positioning vis-a-vis other competing models in this space.
The second pillar of the Bajaj Auto strategy is in exports, which are growing by 10 per cent and, therefore, “remarkable” in the current environment of global volatility. Trade wars are now gaining traction and there is huge geopolitical tension across the world.
“There is trouble almost everywhere and despite all this the fact that we are still growing is remarkable,” says Bajaj. The exports drive has also ensured that the company is relatively better insulated from most other counterparts in the current slowdown in India. Sales have been falling rapidly across product categories and this is where overseas shipments have more than helped counter the balance.
“From my point of view, segment innovation and investment in exports has helped us especially during this time when the market is falling,” says Bajaj.
The third pillar of the success story is the tight control on costs that has helped weather the slowdown. To put this in context, it is no secret that car dealerships have been shutting down at a rapid pace over the last 18 months with the most recent tally being 286.
Dealers have privately confided that companies went overboard with new showrooms in anticipation of the good times continuing.
All these projections went completely haywire when the market imploded instead. Today, with the slowdown not likely to disappear in a hurry, all these huge dealership investments have ended up hurting the retail community big time.
By the end of the day, it is clear customers are not interested in all this razzmatazz, which also explains why small has become the norm for many car-makers in the dealership space. According to Bajaj, the current downturn is part of a business cycle where it has managed to weather the storm thanks to the three-pillar focus of segment innovation, exports and cost-control.
In an earlier interview, the MD had said that the company has been doing well “as we played to our strengths... our strong brands in the entry and sports segments”.
“We did so because gaining intra-segment share is always easy but often unsustainable.. when you gain inter-segment share, as we have with CT 100, Platina and Pulsar invading the middle, such gain is much harder for competition to negate,” he added.
Bajaj also acknowledges the valuable tips received from Harsh Mariwala, Chairman of Marico, who had told him last year that he could perhaps look at low-cost innovation as a way forward.
This was the ‘penny drop’ moment for Bajaj, who quickly understood that the solution lay in offering some differentiation with affordable innovation.
By the end of the day, the buyers of products such as the CT 100 and Platina will pay just a little bit more but the innovation needs to be big. “Today, these two models have a host of new features, which all qualify as low-cost innovations. All this is thanks to Mariwala,”says Bajaj, who in an earlier interview, has referred to the Marico Chairman as “one of the biggest marketing brains”.
Bajaj had also said that low-cost innovations in commuter bikes were a different kind of challenge compared to sports bikes where one can liberally play around with the bells and whistles. In commuter bikes, there is “a little more cost but a lot more thought”.
Eventually, there should be enough surprise and credibility in low-cost innovation even while it should “be self-evident” to the customer."

10,2019-09-13,Bajaj Auto,"Can Bajaj’s fallback claim new territory for itself?
If you flip back through the years, you will know that Bajaj has had a steady presence in the 125 cc motorcycle segment in the past. It has been the trusted Discover for the most part, and there have been rumours of a Platina that is set to join its ranks as well. However, it is a sizeable chunk of the market and Bajaj has decided it should throw its best into the ring. Step in the Pulsar, a brand that is celebrating 18 years of existence in various shapes and forms, and indeed cubic capacity. This one, the 125 Neon, is the smallest in the range yet. Over the years, the Pulsar has staked its claim with its aggressive design and performance. With the new 125 Neon, Bajaj hopes to offer that same value to a fresh section of the market.
There is little that has changed as far as the Pulsar brand goes, the ones without alphabet suffixes anyway. The erstwhile Pulsar 135, the 150 and the 180 have all carried on the same basic design for nearly two decades.






The bike puts out 12 bhp of power  
 
The bike puts out 12 bhp of power 
There are some changes like the headlamp design, the introduction of clip-on handlebars and the ‘Neon’ badge. In essence though, the Pulsar 125 Neon today is pretty much the same motorcycle that Bajaj had debuted in the second facelift.
The silhouette, panels, instrument cluster and lamps remain unchanged. While for some of us this may appear to be not such a good thing, Bajaj hopes there will be others who will lap it up. The target audience would have to be those looking for a smaller capacity, cheaper option to become a part of the extended Pulsar family.








 
While all the panels remain the same, the Neon version gets bright accents on the side panels, and the 3D ‘Pulsar’ badge itself has been finished in a rubberised material in bright colour options, rather than the usual chrome.
With the new Pulsar 125, Bajaj has resisted the temptation of plonking the Discover motor in it. Instead, they have chosen to downsize the existing 150 cc motor, thanks to a shorter stroke.






The 150 cc engine has been given a shorter bore, making it a 125 cc mill    -  Debabrata Sarkar  
 
The 150 cc engine has been given a shorter bore, making it a 125 cc mill    -  Debabrata Sarkar 
The result is a 124.4 cc, single cylinder, air-cooled engine that makes 12 bhp and 11 Nm of torque.
Turn over the engine using the starter button (you have the option of kick-starting it) and it settles down into a soft idle. Swing a leg over, the 790-mm seat height is easily accessed, and the Pulsar 125 feels as familiar as you could imagine. The clip-on handlebars are within easy reach, while your legs rest with a slight rearward bias.
The long clutch lever travel takes a bit of getting used to, especially off the line as you need to build up a few revs to get moving. As you watch the needle climb the tachometer, the ride just about begins to smoothen out. The motor sounds unrefined till about 4000 revs, although things should improve once the bike has been properly run in. It is in the middle of the rev range that it is the smoothest with enough power on tap too.
Cruise along with the motor around 6000 revs, moving up through the five speed gearbox, and the Pulsar 125 works well.
However, if you want to exploit the entire, rated dozen in its horsepower kitty and keep the throttle pinned till it gets to the redline, a familiar boom will engulf the experience.
Roll back and ease off the throttle, tease the gearbox into action and you can cruise at 70-80 kmph without any hassles.
Yes, you can hurry it along to cross a speed indicated 100 kmph, but that is better left alone.
Thanks to the Pulsar 125’s dimensions and weight, it feels like a larger motorcycle and remains planted. Whether you tackle broken roads or a quick dash down the highway, it does not feel unsettled. Springs have been set up for a soft, plush ride, which manages to soak up smaller potholes easily. However, given this fact, it may not react as well when it encounters larger potholes. There was a steady drizzle through the length of the test ride and the roads were past being grippy.






The instrument cluster stays the same  
 
The instrument cluster stays the same 
The EuroGrip tyres weren’t inspiring much confidence and the wooden feel at the front disc made me leave the brake test bit alone.








 
It does use a 240 mm disc, which should provide enough stopping power though. Handling on the Pulsar should be good enough, although you may need to swap tyres for better grip levels.
While we will need to wait for the new generation of Pulsars a little while longer, thanks to BS VI regulations, Bajaj has tried to maximise the potential of its most popular brand.
It manages to offer something that isn’t readily available in the 125 cc segment, a dash of flair and performance. It is as proven as a motorcycle can be and it continues to work well.
Though there are a couple of niggles; it isn’t the smoothest motor, there is the possibility of finding the odd false neutral and my particular motorcycle had a tendency of increasing idle speed in slow moving traffic.
The fact that they offer an identical product (when compared to the larger capacity sibling) with a slightly smaller tank and a cheaper price tag — ₹66,618 (ex-showroom, Disc) and ₹64,000 (ex-showroom, Drum) — may appeal to some people. Although, with the 150 cc version available at ₹71,200 (ex-showroom), I’d spend the few extra bucks instead."

(L to R): Nitin Gadkari, Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Rajiv Bajaj, MD, Bajaj Auto Ltd and S Amitabh Kant, CEO Niti Ayog unveil the all-new Bajaj Chetak electric scooter in New Delhi.
   -  Kamal Narang


NITI Aayog Chief Executive Officer Amitabh Kant on Wednesday said that amidst disruption in the electric automobile category, the country should not miss the bus of being a hub for electric vehicles (EVs) in the world.
“We are in the midst of the biggest disruption in the mobility world. And, whether we like it or not, this disruption will take place, the world will move away from combustion engine — from 2,000 parts to 20 odd parts — and the cost of battery will fall radically... and therefore, the cost of an EV and the total cost of ownership, and consumer will go for it,” he said here on Wednesday.
Speaking at the unveiling of a Bajaj electric scooter, Kant said that India missed out on many areas in various industries. “We lost out on solar cells, we lost out on mobile manufacturing/telecom equipment and in all these areas we have become a major importing nation.”
The think-tank had a few months back told the industry clearly that “we must lay out a clear road map and we said not one year, two years, five years, but six years we give you — six years down the line you must become the dominant form of manufacturing for electric two and three wheelers,” Kant explained.
“Led by Rajiv Bajaj and Venu Srinivisan (of TVS Motor Company) they protested and objected and they kind of said that ‘this policy is wrong and they said that ‘we will get a study done... We have not got the study till date,” Kant said.
Kant also mentioned that he was happy to see that Bajaj has unveiled an electric scooter, which means that “they can also be part of the future mobility.”
Nitin Gadkari, Minister for Road Transport and Highways, who was the chief guest, said the government’s dream of electric cars, two-wheelers, buses is progressing very fast so it was required to push companies towards e-mobility to save on fuel import bill.
“Our job is just to push it otherwise nobody will do so on their own. Everybody loves status quo. I can see that our dream of electric cars, two-wheelers, buses is progressing very fast. There is a lot of talk of timelines but I think it is not required. Electricity, as a fuel, is so cheap, pollution-free, and the cost will also come down as volumes go up, that people will make a beeline for them,” he said.
 










 
Defending himself, Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, Bajaj Auto, said, “My only disagreement (with NITI Aayog) was when a policy was proposed for a very rapid conversion to 100 per cent EVs by 2023 and 2025. Thankfully, that prospect seems to have faded... we are constantly trying to align ourselves with the government’s policies.”
Bajaj Auto is the first major combustion engine manufacturer to unveil an EV. It launched an e-scooter ‘Chetak’, which will hit the road in January — in Pune and Bengaluru — to start with. The price will also be announced at the time of the launch, Bajaj said.

Then: Rahul Bajaj at the launch of Bajaj Chetak scooter in 1972


The mood was one of nostalgia on Wednesday. As Bajaj Auto prepared to unveil its new Chetak electric scooter in Delhi, it was preceded by visuals of an era gone. This was the time when the brand, in its earlier geared avatar, ruled the Indian two-wheeler market.
The icing on the cake, needless to add, was the Hamara Bajaj commercial which continues to enjoy tremendous recall despite the fact that many years have gone by since it was first aired on television.
At one level, it is not entirely surprising that the company decided to retain Chetak as its brand for the new electric scooter. It may have been yanked off the production line years ago to keep pace with the changing times and focus on motorcycles but the recall factor continues to be very high.
After all, it is only too well known that brands never die which also explains why Jawa has been resurrected or, similarly, why PSA chose to acquire the Ambassador brand from the CK Birla group. In the two-wheeler space, Chetak stood tall even while it had to eventually yield space to the motorcycle wave and bowed out.
RL Ravichandran, a two-wheeler veteran who was once part of the leadership team at Bajaj Auto, is clearly excited about the revival of the brand given that he has been associated with its rise and fall during his tenure.
Ravichandran believes that the new electric avatar has the potential to be a winner in the market. While giving his thumbs-up to the Chetak’s styling and design, he is convinced that it will scale new heights since “there is nobody else who can resurrect a brand like Chetak other than Bajaj Auto with its outstanding product development capabilities”.
This will, of course, be known only towards the launch date in January 2020 but anything in the range of under ₹1 lakh will do the trick in attracting customers by the droves to showrooms. Bajaj will also take one step at a time with its market strategy where Pune and Bengaluru will be the first to welcome the Chetak.
It is logical to assume that other centres with their share of young IT professionals will also be targeted which will then mean the likes of Hyderabad, Vizag, Chennai and so on. Equally, Bajaj will work out an export plan for the Chetak keeping in line with its objective of being a true global player.
As part of the retail strategy, the scooter will be sold in the exclusive Probiking outlets which again is a smart move since it will mean a premium positioning. This is where brands like KTM are also retailed and the buyers who come here pretty much know what they want. For them, price is not a deterrent so long as everything else is in place.
What brand attributes did the Chetak stand for during the years when it was the monarch of the marketplace? Ravichandran, whose last assignment was CEO of Royal Enfield, rattles off a list that includes power, signature style gear shifting, ease of riding/parking, low maintenance costs, its unique locking facility etc.
“For the new Chetak, what is critical is the brand’s positioning strategy,” he adds. For those old-timers who rode the scooter in the ‘80s, the revival of the brand would also be music to their ears. After all, a whole lot of them would have been quite crestfallen when Bajaj Auto decided to stop manufacturing scooters and focus solely on motorcycles.
As its Managing Director, Rajiv Bajaj, also explained at the launch event, this was also essential keeping in line with the objective at that point in time to increase the company’s export component to at least 20 per cent of overall output.
It is also no secret that, by the late-1990s, the geared scooter market was wilting in front of the motorcycle onslaught. Even while Bajaj Auto offered other scooter choices like Sunny, Spirit, Saffire and Kristal, it had by then decided to shift track to motorcycles.
The success of the Pulsar was doubtless was a reason for this move and the fact that it continues to grow from strength to strength 18 years later only vindicates the company’s decision. Rajiv Bajaj has also maintained that it is important to be a specialist while striving to be a differentiator in the motorcycle space.
Over the years since it exited the scooter segment, Bajaj Auto has expanded its motorcycle umbrella with brands like KTM, Husqvarna and Triumph now complementing its own portfolio of offerings like CT 100, Platina, Pulsar, Avenger and Dominar 400. It is into this new arena that the electric Chetak steps into decades after it bid adieu.
It is perhaps appropriate at this point to rewind to an interview this winter had with Rajiv Bajaj on the subject of storytelling. For instance, people come and people go but stories are immortal as in the case of icons like Muhammad Ali and Mahatma Gandhi or even controversial figures like Adolf Hitler.
This is the reason why marketing guru, Jack Trout (who passed away two years ago) had always maintained that good marketing is good storytelling. “It means that if you can’t tell a good story, you don’t have a good brand. If a brand is so well thought out that it has differentiation, has attributes and creates its own category, it is part of storytelling,” Bajaj said.
Likewise, he added, Rolex is a story and if 100 people buy the watch, does it mean that all know the story of Rolex? At least 97 would not be aware but the three or five who know the story are charmed by it and they buy it. These are the early adopters. “Later, people like you and me follow suit because they bought it first,” Bajaj said.
Packaging is the other critical ingredient which explains why Apple invests so much in its stores. A company can have a great product and great story but if this is sold in a shabby fashion, it will not perform to its potential. “The product with its story and packaging defines the brand. And the brand along with a clear attribute and the category it creates is the strategy,” Bajaj explained.
Getting back to the Chetak and its new electric version, what is a huge strength in its favour is that it was a successful brand in the heady days of the scooter. Today, it is back but appropriately positioned to appeal to the new set of millennial buyers. Nostalgia is a great thing but no brand can ride on this alone.
It is here that Bajaj Auto has sent out the right intent in being a differentiator in the electric space. If everything goes according to plan, the new Chetak has the potential to be a trailblazer. What will definitely do the trick is a competitive introductory price offer to lure buyers to the showrooms. Electric mobility may still be in its infancy stages in India but there is no telling how the momentum will change in the coming years. Fiscal incentives will play a big role here as also others factors like range and availability of charging infrastructure. In India, argue industry experts. the best way forward is to spread its presence in the two and three-wheeler segments first.
Chetak’s potential buyers are India’s new generation which is keen to trying out new concepts and would also like to be noticed by its peers. They would also like to be part of any movement that is associated with positive messaging like clean air for instance where the likes of a 16-year-old Greta Thunberg more than made an impact at the recent UN summit on climate change.
It is here that a brand like Chetak can weave the magic in wooing this potentially huge buyer base. For now, there may not be any immediate threat to the internal combustion engine but, equally, there is no telling how quickly the electric wave will happen. At least, the policy think tank in NITI Aayog is convinced that it will occur sooner than later which means industry will need to be ready for it.
For now, Bajaj Auto has picked up the gauntlet and will clearly be keen to make a statement. There are other electric scooters already in the market from the stables of start-up companies and companies in the non-auto arena. However, this is the first case of an established Indian two-wheeler manufacturer bringing out an electric mobility option. Whether Chetak can recreate the ‘Hamara Bajaj’ magic of yesteryear will be known in the coming months."

The dispute started in 2007 when TVS Motor unveiled its new motorcycle 125cc TVS Flame. Bajaj Auto had then accused TVS of copying its patented DTSi (digital twin spark ignition) technology in the bike. TVS argued that the Flame was fitted with a three-valve engine based on CCVTi (Controlled Combustion Variable Timing Intelligent) technology, which was different from the technology used by Bajaj Auto.
The legal battle intensified with TVS filing a suit under the Indian Patents Act in the Madras High Court to counter Bajaj’s claims on patent infringement. It also filed a defamation suit against Bajaj Auto in the Bombay High Court.
A Supreme Court order restrained TVS Motor from making and selling Flame and directed the Madras High Court to hear all interim applications. In May 2009, the Madras High Court allowed TVS to use its twin-spark ignition technology saying that there was a marked difference between 3-valve configuration of TVS and 2-valve configuration of Bajaj vis-à-vis positioning of the twin plugs in the respective engines, which were quite visible. 
Following this order, Bajaj filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the decision to permit the production and sale of the TVS Flame."

For Bajaj Auto, it is going to be more than just a homecoming for the Chetak, which debuts in its new avatar as an electric scooter in January.
“This time around, the strategy is to pay homage to the brand and we have decided to put everything behind it,” Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, told Business Line. From his point of view, this is a legacy scooter and an “elder brand” that was the pivot of the company’s business for decades.
The idea is to show that Bajaj Auto has “done justice” to its past which means it will pull out all the stops for the electric Chetak. Quite unlike its earlier innings as a value-for-money geared scooter that was the monarch of all it surveyed, the e-Chetak is not going to be a cheap offering.
This is a far cry from the 1980s when the only premium scooters were from the stables of Kinetic Honda and LML. Times have changed now with the e-Chetak expected to be priced at ₹1-1.5 lakh. In the process, its positioning will be distinctly premium even vis-a-vis its siblings at Bajaj Auto comprising motorcycles, three-wheelers and the Qute quadricycle.
Further, there will be no ‘Bajaj’ association with this e-scooter and it will just remain Chetak. Additionally, as part of the brand building experience, there will be two exclusive Chetak dealerships in Bengaluru and Pune where it will first be launched.
These will be, what is traditionally defined as, COCO (company-owned, company-operated) outlets with tremendous emphasis on the showroom display, design and overall buying experience.
Beyond this, Bajaj Auto will also house the Chetak across its 500-odd KTM dealerships in the country. KTM is the Austrian bike brand owned by Bajaj whose Duke motorcycles are manufactured and sold both here and overseas.
According to Rajiv Bajaj, the idea is to have small pop-up stores within these KTM outlets for Chetak. In the process, KTM buyers will also get to see this new electric scooter which means roping in their extended families comprising spouses, kids, siblings and even parents.
The retail strategy is keeping in line with the premium positioning of Chetak. KTM motorcycles are also priced at over ₹1 lakh and the customers coming here are the ones targeted for Chetak too. The retail experience here is quite different from what is seen at other conventional showrooms for mass commuter two-wheelers.
It is also no secret that tech distribution is the biggest obstacle for a new foray like electric scooters and it is here that Bajaj Auto plans to pull out all the stops with its vast KTM network. Consequently, this will be a huge advantage over other players in this space who just have a sprinkling of retail outlets.
To put this in context, beyond the exclusive showroom in Bengaluru, the Chetak will also be part of at least 10 KTM dealerships in the city. As a result, the impact will be more widespread with greater word-of-mouth happening. Over the next 6-12 months, there is tremendous work in store for the Chetak marketing team on product validation and seeking customer feedback. The good news is that at least 300 KTM dealers are waiting to get their hands on Chetak. After all, a new offering means more footfalls and the investments on these pop-up stores will be quite minimal.
“The dealerships will be modern and futuristic,” reiterates Rajiv Bajaj while driving home the message that there is really no space for history and nostalgia. After all, the buyers for the e-Chetak represent a completely different generation with their own set of priorities.
“If there is good traction, there could be more dealerships for Chetak. Nothing should be lost in translation while building the brand,” adds Rajiv Bajaj. Going forward, the Chetak platform will be used to roll out electric scooters under the KTM and Husqvarna (the Swedish motorcycle brand acquired by KTM) brands. Along with Chetak, all three will be positioned as global offerings for a host of other markets."

 Shared e-mobility service provider Yulu on Tuesday said it has secured $8 million (approximately Rs 57.2 crore) investment from two-wheeler major Bajaj Auto.
 As part of the tie-up, Yulu will source electric two-wheelers from Bajaj Auto which have been co-designed and manufactured exclusively for shared micro-mobility, Yulu said in a statement.
 Bajaj Auto will also consider facilitating vehicle finance needs of Yulu for a large-scale deployment of its micro-mobility electric vehicles, it added.
“We believe that congestion reduction and pollution control will drive the segment of shared micro-mobility in the future,” Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj said.
 That, coupled with the expansion of mass rapid transport systems like Metro in large cities, will further boost the demand for flexible last-mile connectivity, he added.
“In Yulu, we find an experienced and committed partner with robust achievement of success metrics in a very short time. And this is why we decided to partner with them in their journey of bringing Yulu service to every neighbourhood of urban India,” Bajaj said.
 Yulu said the fresh round of investment will be utilised for further strengthening of the mobility platform and deepening of the technology solutions for rapid expansion.
 The company plans to increase its fleet size to 1,00,000 electric two-wheelers by Dec 2020 with an extensive network of its battery-swapping stations across the cities where it operates.
“Yulu’s electric two-wheelers will help Indian commuters with the first and the last mile connectivity option. This partnership aims to solve the mobility challenges of urban India in an eco-friendly manner,” Yulu Co-Founder and CEO Amit Gupta said.
 Currently, Yulu is present in Bengaluru, New Delhi, Pune, Greater Mumbai, and Bhubaneswar."

Sumeet Narang admits that the next couple of months will “definitely be a busy period” for Bajaj Auto.
More specifically, there will be a lot of action at its Probiking outlets which are now home to the KTM motorcycle brand but will soon be joined by the electric Chetak and Husqvarna.
As President (Probiking), Narang is quite excited as the current calendar year draws to a close and the stage is set for a busy 2020. It was a few days ago when he was part of the unveiling exercise in Goa for the Husqvarna duo of the Vitpilen 250 and Svartpilen 250 along with the KTM 390 Adventure.
KTM, incidentally, acquired Husqvarna from BMW Motorrad six years ago. Bajaj, in turn, has 48 per cent in KTM and its Chakan plant near Pune is now home to the Austrian bike maker’s 125-400cc range. This will soon include Husqvarna, which will be retailed both here and overseas.
Narang is quite stoic about the fact that every unveiling is a big day since there is “so much that goes into it followed by huge expectations”. Specifically, on the recent Goa event, he believes that it marks the entry of two “very meaningful products and brands”.
One is a completely new brand in the form of Husqvarna, which has its got own space, whilethe KTM 390 Adventure signals the arrival of a totally new platform and the third after the naked bikes and the fully-faired RC (the fairing is the shell placed over the frame of the motorcycle).
“This makes it special and we are looking forward to this as a new category,” says Narang. The 390 Adventure will be available in the showrooms by early January and this is also the time its price will be announced along with ramp-up plans.
As for Husqvarna, its launch will follow in early February. The present KTM showrooms are now being upgraded to accommodate Husqvarna too. The other important resident in these outlets is the e-Chetak which marks Bajaj Auto’s entry into electric mobility with a modern scooter sporting the iconic brand of yesteryear.
The upgrade exercise will cover at least 20 top major metros in the first month of launch and completely executed over the following six months. Eventually, the showrooms will reflect both brands and their architecture.
As for the e-Chetak, it is quite different from these two motorcycles but Narang believes that the selling process boils down to a function of training. “Each of these products is different but not so dramatically (different) that you cannot manage to sell them,” he says.
The e-Chetak will have its own teams inside the showrooms while KTM and Husqvarna, likewise, will have their own personnel. Going forward, the Chetak platform will be leveraged to roll out electric scooters for both KTM and Husqvarna. In the process, India’s role as a global base for these two brands will only grow in the coming years.
For now, the all-new brand is Husqvarna and, as Narang says, there is only “so much that market research can tell you”. What Bajaj Auto certainly does see is that there are too many prominent segments in the premium biking space.
One of these is high performance sports bikes, which is the domain of KTM operates, while the other is the more classic laid-back performance bikes. “What we are seeing both here and overseas is that there is space for a lifestyle bike with high performance and this is the sweet spot which Husqvarna will occupy,” continues Narang.
As he puts it, the product comes with “very unique and minimalistic Swedish design language” along with premium/elegant fit & finish but with enough power and performance to be able to enjoy the ride. “It is also packed with technology that KTM is known for and somebody seeking a lifestyle bike gets the best of both worlds: great form and outstanding performance,” says Narang. Typically, the South and West are big markets for high performance bikes and these include cities like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune etc. When it comes to lifestyle products, though, it is not easy to predict the demand patterns. The good thing, says Narang, is that the Husqvarna bikes are being launched in “the sweet spot” of 250cc which combines power and performance for long distance as well as the practicalities of everyday city ride. “We are consciously doing this in order to get a degree of scale since this is important,” he explains.
From Bajaj Auto’s point of view, the strategy is in line with its focus on brand differentiation since Husqvarna comes with its own badge and completely different brand values. At a brand level, says Narang, there could be a rub-off/overlap with KTM but Husqvarna “is a brand with a lot more understated and mature styling with premium fit and finish”.
The only commonality is performance but that is the basic requirement for any passionate bike rider. “We will start off with word-of-mouth for Husqvarna to build the brand. It will dwell on its roots in Sweden going back to 1903,” says Narang.
In his view, it has a rich heritage that will be conveyed in the marketing drive to build the brand. “It is an interesting brand in a segment which is otherwise dominated by aggressive sports bikes. This difference would make Husqvarna unique since it is speaking a different language and would make for a great story,” adds Narang.
By the end of the day, he believes legacy brings a lot of credibility to a brand irrespective of any age group. “Yet, we are not selling it as a heritage bike that is steeped in retro charm. The bike is as contemporary and modern as it gets with a different design language,” reiterates Narang.
From his point of view, Husqvarna is a brand with a lesser known legacy in India which is still a benefit of sorts. “This legacy will play to its strengths as people will know that it is a brand that has proven itself over the last 100 plus years,” he says.
Narang also prefers to take one thing at a time and see how the market responds to these new launches. He would rather see “what directions actually take place” by which time “we will we a lot wiser over the next 12 months”.
In today’s time and age of uncertainty, says Narang, it is impossible to stick to a fully chalked out five-year plan since this would be both naive and foolhardy. “What we are bringing to the table is products with the latest in performance, technology, design etc,” he says.
Yet, he is reasonably confident that over the next three years, Husqvarna will be as big a brand as KTM in terms of volumes. By this time, there will also be electric scooters coming in from both brands to complement Chetak. It is quite clear that Narang and his team will have their hands full through 2020 and beyond."
0,﻿2019-12-12,Bajaj Auto,"From 125 to 790 — a KTM for every kind of biker
It is now a year since the KTM 125 Duke debuted and it has managed to draw a younger group of buyers into its fold.
According to Sumeet Narang, these include people from smaller towns who have always aspired for a KTM. It is finding favour with a lot of 18-year-olds, whose parents are open to buying this as a first two-wheeler brand for their kids. 
Yet, there are other customers, who come into KTM showrooms for a 125 Duke and end up buying a 200 or a 250.
“We ensure that they are offered test rides of the product they come for as well as the more powerful option,” said Narang in an earlier interview during the launch of the 790 Duke. What the 125 Duke has done is “to give us a fantastic entry-level strategy into the KTM brand”, while with the 790, it is the top-of-the pyramid. At the end of the day, he said, KTM bikes have their own riding character. “For us, we don’t want to lose the customer,” he explained which means there is a model for each category of buyer, right from the 18-year-old to the passionate rider, who will opt for more powerful versions going up to the 790 Duke. “There are different usage patterns emerging and if you identify a large enough pool and launch the right product, you can grow the space,” reasoned Narang.
The 125 Duke throws open a mass market for KTM and there has been “no compromise” on its features in terms of stripping it down. “Consumers are smart and need to see value in what they buy. What makes KTM special is its agility and the 125 should be as much as KTM as its 790 sibling,” said Narang.
According to him, Bajaj Auto is “mindful of what we are selling in the premium space” and the idea is to lift customers’ brand experiences “as we go along”. The 790 Duke, on the other end of the spectrum, marks a significant jump over the 390 not only in engine capacity but in electronics, technology etc.
“This bike is ideal for the high-performance seeker,” said Narang. As he puts it, there is something about riding and nothing can replace this experience for a passionate biker. Owning a superbike, however, is not easy and KTM tries to ease this out through its large network and ability to source parts faster."
