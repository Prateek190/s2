76,2018-04-03,ONGC,"GIC Re bags ONGC contract
State-owned re-insurer GIC Re has once again won the contract for the reinsurance of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation’s Offshore Package Policy programme 2018-2020.
This is a prestigious account as ONGC is the nation’s largest oil exploration and production company.
As a domestic re-insurer, GIC Re is entitled to a 5 per cent share in any reinsurance contract. But the placement was won after going through an international bidding process as mega risks cannot be fully absorbed in the domestic market alone and require placement in international markets for a better spread of risks. GIC Re, as the lead re-insurer, will have a 15 per cent share in the programme while the balance will be done by a number of international re-insurers. About 30 re-insurers had participated in the previous year’s programme. The reinsurance programme extends comprehensive coverage to ONGC’s upstream offshore assets valued at more than $40 billion. Upstream offshore assets include platforms, rigs, production complexes and pipelines.
The total reinsurance policy premium for the programme is $12.62 million, a senior official of the GIC Re said. GIC Re will earn 15 per cent of this as its share.
The premium has come down by about 7.5 per cent as compared to the previous year’s premium because of the attractive claims history of ONGC, the official said."

Foreign companies gave India’s oil and gas exploration business a miss, yet again. In the first round of auctions under the Open Acreage License Policy (OALP) for the hydrocarbon blocks, it was public sector giant ONGC and Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd that put in the highest number of bids.
Vedanta has bid for all the 55 blocks on offer while ONGC has put in 37 bids. Oil India has put in 18 bids, while GAIL (India)put in 6.
IndianOil and Bharat Petroresources also bid for the blocks, taking the total number of PSUs or their subsidiaries that participated in the auction to 5.
In an official statement, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons said 110 bids have been received for the 55 blocks on offer. Four Indian private companies, Vedanta, Selan Exploration, Hindustan Oil Exploration and Sun Petrochemicals, have also bid for the blocks.
There were 46 onland blocks and 9 offshore blocks on offer. For the onland blocks, 92 bids were received while 18 bids came for the offshore blocks.
Blocks CB-ONHP-2017/11 and CB-ONHP-2017/12 have secured maximum bids (3 bids each) during the round. Both these blocks are in the Cambay Basin.
Two blocks have received a single bid, these are RJ-ONHP-2017/6 in Rajasthan and CB-ONHP-2017/1 in the Cambay Basin. Since Vedanta has bid for all the blocks on offer, the only bids here are theirs.
The bids will now be evaluated on the basis of the minimum work programme and revenue offered to the government.
A DGH statement said, “The government endeavours to award these blocks by June to expedite the exploration activities to establish some part of the huge prognosticated conventional hydrocarbon resources of the order of 230 barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas in the ‘yet to find’ category in India.”"
73,2018-05-22,ONGC,"Moody's sees ONGC and OIL sharing burden for subsidising fuel price
Moody’s Investors Service has assessed that as oil prices rise, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) are facing an increasing risk that the Government will once again require them to share in the country's fuel-subsidy burden.
Vikas Halan, a Moody's Senior Vice-President said, “Because of the government's widening fiscal deficit, ONGC and OIL could be asked to bear part of the government's fuel subsidy for oil, if prices stay above $60 per barrel for the fiscal year ending March 2019.”
Moody's notes that if ONGC and OIL are obligated to contribute the entire subsidized amount exceeding the government's budgeted figure for the fiscal year ending March 2019, such a requirement would constrain their net realised prices to $52-$56 per barrel, which is only marginally lower than or equal to the $56 for financial year 2017-2018.
Moody's estimates that fuel subsidies could total ₹ 340 to ₹ 530 billion in financial year 2018-2019, the highest since financial year 2014-2015, assuming Brent crude oil prices average between $60-$80 per barrel.
The government has budgeted for ₹250 billion of fuel subsidies in the current financial year, leaving a shortfall of ₹90-280 billion, which could be met by ONGC and OIL entirely, or in part, if the government increases the budget allocation for these subsidies."
72,2018-05-22,ONGC,"ONGC to double natural gas production in next 3-4 years 
ONGC plans to double natural gas production from the present 24 BCM (billion cubic meters) to roughly 50 BCM in the next three to four years and the Krishna-Godavari basin in Andhra Pradesh plays a crucial role in the endeavour to secure the energy security of the country, according to the Chairman and Managing Director, Shashi Shanker.
He told the media here on Tuesday that a month ago, the Union Minister for Oil and Natural Gas, Dharmendra Pradhan, had kick-started the offshore project, off Kakinada in East Godavari district.
""Gas production from NELP Block KG-DWN-98/2 in deep waters off Kakinada is expected to commence from 2019 and ONGC would produce 25.87 mt of oil and 45.28 BCM of gas by 2034-35 from the field,"" he said, adding that Rs 33,000 crore would be spent on developing the offshore fields in the K-G
The Chairman said the acquisition of 51.1 per cent stake in HPCL by ONGC was a very beneficial move, in view of the synergies between the two PSU companies, and ""it makes ONGC a truly vertically integrated company. We are also working on the merger of HPCL and MRPL, another ONGC subsidiary, but it may take some time’’.
Shanker also spoke about the projects being taken up by ONGC abroad, in Abu Dhabi and Russia and elsewhere. In response to a question on shale gas, he said preliminary exploratory efforts were being made in Gujarat, but they were still at a very nascent stage. He said ONGC had spent Rs 66 crore in Andhra Pradesh on CSR activities during the last financial year.
Later in the afternoon, the CMD inaugurated the Nagayalanka onshore project taken up in Krishna district along with Cairn Energy India Ltd. Peak oil and gas production from the project is expected to be 2931 BOPD (barrels of oil per day) and 1.5 LCMD (lakh cubic meters of natural gas per day).
D M R Sekhar, Executive Director and asset manager of Rajahmundry, also spoke on the occasion."
71,2018-05-24,ONGC,"Oil stocks tumble 11% on tax woes
 Oil stocks tumbled up to 11 per cent today following reports that the government may levy a windfall tax on oil producers like ONGC as part of a permanent solution it is working on for moderating the spiralling retail prices of petrol and diesel.
Shares of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation tanked 11.44 per cent to Rs 155.45 on the BSE. Oil India Ltd tumbled 11.23 per cent to Rs 204.65.
The tax, which may come in the form of a cess, will kick in the moment oil prices cross $70 per barrel, sources privy to the development said.
Under the scheme, oil producers, who get paid international rates for the oil they produce from domestic fields, would have to part with any revenue they earn from prices crossing $70 per barrel mark. 
Petrol and diesel prices were raised for the 11th day in succession today as the state-owned oil firms gradually passed on to the consumer the increased cost of international oil that had accumulated since a 19-day freeze was imposed just before Karnataka elections."

 State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has replaced a government nominee director on board of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) with its nominee as it consolidates control over the company it had recently acquired.
ONGC, which had in January completed the acquisition of the government’s 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore, has appointed its Director (Finance) Subhash Kumar on the company board, sources said. He has replaced Sushma Taishete Rath, Joint Secretary in Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.
Till now HPCL had two government nominee directors - Rath and Sandeep Poundrik, Joint Secretary (Refineries) of the oil ministry. After the appointment of Kumar, there remains only one government nominee director on HPCL. The sources said ONGC wants the one government nominee director on HPCL board to be the same person as on its board.
ONGC Board has two government directors - Amar Nath, Joint Secretary - Exploration in the Oil Ministry, and Rajiv Bansal, Additional Secretary & Financial Adviser in the ministry. It wants Bansal to be appointed on HPCL board in place of Poundrik to have a common link between the two boards, they said.
After acquiring government’s stake, HPCL is now a subsidiary of ONGC. Like its other major subsidiaries -- Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) and ONGC Videsh Ltd, ONGC decided to nominate just one director on the board of HPCL, sources said.
HPCL board currently has four functional directors besides the Chairman and Managing Director. It also has two government nominee directors and six independent directors. Sources said the Articles of Association of HPCL provide for the board to be made up of a maximum of 20 directors, including independent ones.
ONGC could theoretically speaking, nominate more than one director but such nomination would have to be matched by an appointment of an equal number of independent directors. So, while ONGC can nominate 3 directors, it decided to name only one, they added. MRPL and OVL both have just the ONGC Chairman and Managing Director on their board. Both MRPL and OVL have Managing Director and functional directors.
Since HPCL by virtue of 51 per cent shareholding of ONGC, continues to be a central public sector enterprise (CPSE), its board members would continue to be appointed by the government. Sources said the only question that remains is of the status of HPCL Chairman and Managing Director.
While ONGC’s present subsidiaries MRPL and OVL are headed by Managing Directors with ONGC Chairman being the company chairman, there is a thought that HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Kumar Surana may be allowed to hold his designation and the Coal India Ltd (CIL) model for governance of subsidiaries is followed.
CIL, the world’s largest coal producer, is the holding company whose board is headed by a Chairman and Managing Director. It has eight subsidiaries like Eastern Coalfields Ltd and Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, all of which have a board headed by Chairman and Managing Director. The CMDs of the subsidiaries report to CIL head. 
ources said if this model is followed, Surana will continue as Chairman and Managing Director of HPCL who would report to ONGC head Shashi Shanker. Prior to the stake sale, the government made it clear that HPCL would continue to be a central public sector enterprise (CPSE), retaining its separate identity and brand and will be independently run by its board.
The alternate governance model has been thrown up as a large section in ONGC feels that HPCL should be governed on lines of the company’s other subsidiaries like ONGC Videsh Ltd, which have an independent board and a Managing Director or CEO as heads. These heads of subsidiaries report to ONGC Chairman and Managing Director.
Sources said following the CIL-model of governance will save Surana, who is senior to Shanker, from a designation downgrade."

The Centre has not yet officially asked Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to bear a subsidy on auto fuel, a top ONGC official has said..
“There has been no communication with regards to subsidy sharing as far as ONGC is concerned,” Shashi Shankar, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director, told a press conference here.
Stock markets were jittery on reports stating public sector upstream companies, namely ONGC and Oil India, will be asked to bear a subsidy on petrol and diesel.
The possibilities for the same gained momentum as crude oil prices zoomed and auto fuel prices rallied to record high levels.
Before fuel price deregulation, PSU oil companies bore the burden on petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG.
But when crude oil prices crashed, the government stopped asking them to bear the subsidy burden.
ONGC yesterday reported a ₹5,915-crore profit after tax for the last quarter of FY18. This was 36.3 per cent higher than the ₹4,340-crore net profit reported in Q4 of FY17.

Driving growth The state must give direction to the economy /iStockphoto Kagenmi


 
Why is it that governments do not learn from the mistakes made by others and, instead, make the same mistakes? Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez made the mistake of milking State-owned upstream oil company, PDVSA, using its resources to pay for all his schemes, instead of investing for future production. Venezuela, which has the world’s largest reserves of crude oil, is now bankrupt, as is PDVSA, which does not have the money to extract oil reserves which are there. The competent people have left PDVSA and have emigrated, causing production of crude oil to fall sharply. Since crude is the main source of real revenue and foreign currency for a badly hit economy, Venezuela is facing hyper inflation, food shortages and a worthless currency. Crude oil accounts for 95 per cent of foreign currency revenue.
A recent article in www.zerohedge.com talks about oil production in Venezuela dropping to 1 m b/d by end 2018, down from 3 m.b/d in 2011. [6] This would further raise crude oil prices and dent India’s CAD.
Well, India has not learnt lessons from Venezuela. The Government has been dipping into the cash reserves of ONGC, the largest State owned upstream oil company. Last year it compelled ONGC to buy its stake in PSU refiner HPCL, in order to show a lower fiscal deficit. It then arm twisted the management to declare a high dividend. ONGC cash reserves have reportedly dropped 90% from the $ 4.3 b. it once had [1].
And now the Government is contemplating compelling ONGC to subsidise petrol/diesel! This is an appalling misuse of a PSU company’s resources. Unless stopped, it would result, one day, in a fate similar to PDVSA, which now has no money to invest in production of crude oil for the future.
The Government can’t dip into the coffers of PSU companies whenever it wants to; these companies have minority, public shareholders. Decisions relating to use of surplus cash resources ought to be left to the Boards of Directors of the PSU companies. Such actions negatively affect the valuations of the PSUs.
Or look at how it utilises funds of LIC, India’s largest, state owned, insurance company. There is a proposal to sell its 86% stake in bankrupt IDBI Bank to LIC! [3] Well, excuse me!! The surplus funds with LIC belong to its policy holders and are not to be dipped into to buy failed banks! This is the worst kind of governance, a harebrained idea that ought to be thrown out, along with the person who suggested it.
There was a similar hare brained plan to sell Government’s residual stake in Air India (after its plan to sell 76% to a private buyer) to LIC! Why on earth should LIC hold stock in a failed airline? The decision must be left to the LIC management and not to paper pushing bureaucrats with no experience in running airlines, insurance companies, upstream oil companies or others. [4]
The Government got no expressions of interest from private airlines to buy its 76% stake in Air India because of conditions attached to the sale. These included retention of (surplus) employees, assumption of (unviable) debt and the continuation of a 24% stake by Government. The Government has now, rightly, decided to sell a 100% stake in the airline [5] which is good (also for LIC policyholders) but insufficient. The overhang of excessive employees and debt also needs to be corrected by the Government prior to sale, if it wants genuine interest.
In global developments there were two important ones last week. One was the G7 meet, post which US President Trump tried to break a very old and solid friendship with Canada, its largest trading partner, and also threatens to go after multilateral trade agreements with a hammer. That would be disastrous for the global economy, and hence for stockmarkets.
The second was his meeting with Kim Jong Il of North Korea, a very old and solid enmity which Trump is seeking to mend. One hopes that the joint statement signed by both results in a diminished threat to global peace.
Indian stockmarkets are steady, based largely on continuing funds flow from retail investors. In the short term this flow might be impacted, perhaps from a global event but over the longer term the prospects look good.
Of course, governance needs to improve and PSU’s ought not to be a milch cow for sticky political fingers.

 Visakhapatnam Port Trust, Paradip Port Trust and New Mangalore Port Trust will be exempted from making a mandatory open offer under the Securities and Exchange Board of India regulations when the three Central government-owned port trusts buy a controlling stake in Dredging Corporation of India (DCI), according to a government official briefed on the plan.
The is because the deal between two Central government-owned entities would not result in a change in control – and DCI will remain with the government. This will be the second such instance in recent times when the public shareholders have been given the go-by during the disinvestment of a government firm.
State-owned oil explorer ONGC Ltd was exempted from making the mandatory open offer when it bought HPCL early this year.
“We understand that since it is a government-to-government deal, the open offer will not be necessary,” the official said, asking not to be named.
Besides, an open offer would have reduced the public shareholding in DCI to below 25 per cent from the current 26.53 per cent, thereby violating a SEBI rule for listed firms, including PSUs, to have a minimum 25 per cent public float to ensure wider public participation. Of the public holding, individuals hold 13.53 per cent and insurance companies 6.71 per cent, while banks and financial institutions have 1.91 per cent. 
Competition concerns
While the deal between the three major port trusts and DCI is seen as “politically convenient” for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, competition concerns also played a part in the plan.
DCI is India’s biggest dredging contractor by fleet size and market share, and selling the company to a private dredging entity would have raised concerns about market dominance and abuse, the government official mentioned earlier said. Hence, the deal would have faced hurdles from the Competition Commission of India, he added.
The panel constituted by the Shipping Ministry will recommend the finer details of the block sale, including the quantum of stake to be bought by each port trust in DCI.
The official said the pricing of shares would be based on the report of the asset valuer, Protocol Insurance Surveyors and Loss Assessors Pvt Ltd.
The deal is expected to fetch ₹1,500 crore to the government’s divestment corpus at the current share price of the company."
63,2018-07-18,ONGC,"ONGC, OIL will not bear entire royalty, cess burden in pre-NELP blocks: Pradhan
In a bid to further incentivise oil and gas exploration in the country, particularly by public sector undertakings ONGC and Oil India Ltd, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved four changes in the rules that govern production sharing contracts. 
The revised norms will be applicable on blocks awarded under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) and pre-NELP regime. 
Speaking to reporters after the CCEA meeting, Minister for Petroleum & Natural Gas, Dharmendra Pradhan said, “In order to encourage bidders during the first batch of bids, in some pre-NELP blocks, there was a provision made that the entire cess and royalty burden was to be borne by Oil India and ONGC. This was despite them having a participating interest of lesser than100 per cent in a block. This situation prevailed over the last 2.5 decades.”
“Eventually, the growth of the field decreased under this approach, as the PSUs felt that they were bearing the full royalty burden despite having a participating interest of around 30-40 per cent only making the project unviable. They started expressing their obvious reluctance to the growth of these blocks,” Pradhan said. “In order to resolve this quandary, the Cabinet decided that the royalty and cess payout in these blocks will now be proportionate to the participating interest of the stakeholders,” he added.
Timeline relaxed
The Cabinet also relaxed the timelines for exploration and appraisal of blocks in the North East. An official statement said, “Based on recommendations in ‘Hydrocarbon Vision 2030 for North East’, the Government has extended timelines for exploration and appraisal period in operational blocks of North Eastern region of India considering geographical, environmental and logistical challenges.” “The exploration period has been increased by two years and appraisal period by one year. Further, to stimulate natural gas production in the North East, the Government has also allowed marketing including pricing freedom for natural gas to be produced from discoveries which are yet to commence production as on July 1, 2018,” the statement added.
Another provision made in the PSCs is the extension of tax benefits under Section 42 of Income Tax, 1961 prospectively to operational blocks under Pre-NELP discovered fields. Companies will be allowed to claim 100 per cent of expenditure incurred under a PSC as tax deductible for computing taxable income in the same year. This provision will also be applicable for the extended period of contract under PSC extension policy dated March 28, 2016."

The Centre does not have any proposal to ask ONGC to bear a subsidy on auto fuels beyond a certain price limit. 
Talks and news reports of ONGC and Oil India being asked to foot a subsidy for keeping petrol and diesel prices under check had gained momentum earlier this year. 
In response to a query on the same, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan said, “We do not comment on hypothetical situations.”
Earlier, Pradhan had maintained that the government was taking a holistic view to mitigate the fuel price hike.
Prices fall
The retail price of petrol in the country has fallen from a high of ₹78.43 a litre on May 29 in Delhi to ₹76.37 a litre on July 22. The price of diesel too has fallen to ₹67.98 a litre on Sunday from a high of ₹69.31 a litre on May 29.
Pradhan also said the Centre’s long-term plan to mitigate a surge in auto fuel price included convincing the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to lower crude oil prices.
He said, “It was the result of a long-term strategy that India had adopted that led to oil producing countries under the OPEC lowering the price charged for crude oil purchases. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appealed to the oil producing countries to keep in mind the interest of consuming countries like India. Today, I thank the oil producing nations for honouring India’s request.”
In June, Pradhan had expressed his concern over rising crude oil prices and its negative impact on consumers across the world, particularly in India.
Beyond threshold
An official statement had said that Pradhan emphasised that globally crude prices have gone beyond the threshold which can be sustained. Pradhan had also highlighted that market fundamentals do not support such high prices and urged the OPEC Ambassadors to convey the message to their respective governments regarding the need to move to responsible pricing, one that balances the interests of both the producer and the consumer."
61,2018-07-24,ONGC,"Special concessions 
 Can you have your cake and eat it too? You apparently can, if you’re the government. Lately, the Centre has brokered a series of deals in listed public sector companies where it has ceded its majority equity stake to a new entity, to meet disinvestment targets or free up budgetary resources. SEBI’s Takeover Code is quite clear that where a stake sale results in a change in the management or control of a listed entity, the acquirer must make an open offer to public shareholders of the target, to give them a fair exit. But the Centre has actively lobbied for its deals to be exempted from these requirements. In the case of ONGC-HPCL and the Port Trusts-Dredging Corporation deals, SEBI appears to have given in to the Centre’s requests. The LIC-IDBI Bank case is undecided. 
Last year, ONGC was persuaded to buy out the Centre’s 51.1 per cent equity in HPCL for over ₹36,000 crore in a bid to bridge the hole in the disinvestment proceeds. Parleys are now on to offload the government’s 73.4 per cent stake in listed Dredging Corporation of India to three Port Trusts. Going by SEBI’s Takeover Code, these are clear cases of a change in management control for the listed company, with the equity stake changing hands well above the 25 per cent threshold. Therefore, it is unclear on what grounds the acquirers have been exempted from open offer requirements. The government’s argument is that as the sale is to ‘government’ entities, there’s no trigger for an open offer. But this argument is specious given that the Centre showcases the very same deals as successes of its public sector ‘disinvestment’ programme. Yes, SEBI is empowered to grant open offer exemptions in special cases to safeguard the interests of investors in securities markets. But in the above cases, interests of investors in the acquired firms were best served by insisting on open offers rather than waiving them. In the LIC-IDBI Bank case, such an exemption would stand on even thinner ground, as the whole objective of the deal is to anoint LIC as the new ‘promoter’ to infuse necessary capital into the ailing bank.
Such instances of securities market laws being bent at the whim of the powers-that-be, reflect poorly both on the Centre and the markets regulator. The government is proving to be a poor role model on corporate governance for the promoters of India Inc. It should also recognise that, in repeatedly handing public investors in listed PSUs a raw deal, it is shooting itself in the foot. Given the persisting budget constraints, the Centre will have to lean quite heavily on public market investors in the next few years, to fund ambitious capex plans of public sector entities and meet the capital needs of PSU banks. Meting out cavalier treatment to shareholders can put them off government-owned entities for good."

 The board of ONGC has approved exiting helicopter service provider Pawan Hans by selling its entire 49 per cent stake as it looks to cut debt and consolidate resources in core oil and gas business, officials with direct knowledge of the development said.
 Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) wants its interest to be clubbed with the 51 per cent government stake that is already on offer for sale, they said.
 The Department of Disinvestment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which floated the offer for sale for government’s 51 per cent stake in Pawan Hans twice in the last 10 months, is likely to issue an amended expression of interest (EoI) shortly.
 Officials said, “ONGC of the view that its investment in Pawan Hans is no longer strategic as it charter hires helicopters to ferry staff to its oil and gas locations, mostly in offshore, through competitive bidding.”
 Of the 22 helicopters it currently has on hire, just seven or less than a third are from Pawan Hans.
 Pawan Hans owns a fleet of 46 helicopters.
 “The board of directors of ONGC, at the 308th meeting held on June 29, accorded its in-principle approval for exploring options for the restructuring of ONGC group companies including exiting some with a view to consolidating business,” an official said. 
 “The idea being to focus resources on core oil and gas exploration and production business and not scatter bandwidth of management in unrelated businesses,” the official added.
 Officials said when the government had first floated an offer to sell its 51 per cent stake in October last year, ONGC made an offer to DIPAM that its 49 per cent stake be also sold on same terms.
 At that time, the company was told to get its board approval.
 Meanwhile, the government in early April withdrew its offer for sale as only two bidders including Indian helicopter major Global Vectra Helicorp and US-based Continental Helicopters made an offer. 
 A revised offer for sale was floated later that month, which fetched about half a dozen bidders.
Sources said the re-floating the offer for sale is likely to delay further the government’s plans to offload its entire 51 per cent holding in the profit-making JV.
 “ONGC has written to the civil aviation ministry that it does not want to continue in the joint venture and would want to sell its entire holding in it along with the government,” a Pawan Hans source said.
 Pawan Hans operates seven Dauphin N3 Helicopters for ONGC’s offshore operations. These helicopters, based at Juhu airport, Mumbai and Rajahmundry, undertake passenger crew change service and production trips on a regular basis to meet the offshore requirements of the state-owned oil and gas producer.
 “ONGC wanted to exit the JV along with the government, but it was told to first get its board approval, which is now in place. The government will now modify the EoI and include ONGC stake sale also along with its own,” an ONGC official said.
 The government came out with a fresh information memorandum for the strategic sale of Pawan Hans on April 13 wherein bidders need to have a minimum net worth of Rs 500 crore.
 The memorandum was issued days after the government withdrew the previous note apparently due to a tepid response from investors.
 The last date for submission of EoIs for Pawan Hans was June 18.
 On June 20, civil aviation secretary R N Choubey had told reporters that “bids have been received for Pawan Hans stake sale.”"

 The government has moved Delhi High Court to enforce a USD 3.8 billion recovery from Reliance Industries, Shell and ONGC following an English court ruling over its share from the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields in western offshore, said Dharmendra Pradhan, Oil Minister today.
 The liability is to be split between the three companies in proportion to their stake in the fields. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has 40 per cent interest while RIL and Shell hold 30 per cent each.
 In a written reply in Rajya Sabha, Pradhan said that based on the Final Partial Award (FPA) dated October 12, 2016, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had on May 25, 2017, raised demand for USD 3.8 billion on ONGC, RIL and Shell towards government of India share of profit petroleum and royalty.
 RIL and Shell challenged the FPA before the High Court in London. ONGC was not party to the arbitration.
 “The High Court, London rejected the petition filed by RIL and Shell on April 16, 2018, except on one issue which was remanded to the Arbitral Tribunal,” he said. “For enforcement of the FPA, Government has filed a petition before the Delhi High Court.” 
In December 2010, BG Exploration & Production India Ltd, which was subsequently acquired by Shell, and RIL, initiated an arbitration against the Government of India (GoI) after a dispute over the state’s share of profit and royalty from Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti contract areas off the west coast.
 The Arbitration Tribunal gave its FPA on October 12, 2016. RIL and Shell initiated proceedings under English Arbitration Act 1996 to challenge the arbitration award before the English Commercial Court in November 2016.
 On May 2, 2018, the Court delivered its final judgement, remitting a significant issue for redetermination by the Tribunal within three months while disposing of eight other issues, RIL had said on May 24.
 “The Arbitration Tribunal has scheduled a hearing to determine the remitted issue and will thereafter deliver an award,” it had said.
 It had insisted that before taking up the issue of quantification of liability, the Tribunal has to decide the issue which is remitted by the English court to it.
 BG-RIL propose to file an application to the Tribunal for the increase of Cost Recovery Limit which they are entitled to do under the Production Sharing Contracts.
 “Tribunal can consider the issue of quantification of liability (if any) only after these two issues are decided,” RIL said. “Several issues relating to the claim made by GOI are subject to pending arbitration proceedings.” 
Pradhan said, “out of the four arbitration initiated by RIL in respect of its Krishna Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6, only two are under adjudication.”
 The firm has withdrawn the arbitration against a delay in notifying a gas price and the one against taking away of some area in the KG-D6 block after the expiry of stipulated time frame.
“The arbitrations under adjudication include one against the government disallowing certain costs for KG-D6 output not meeting the targets because of non-drilling of stipulated wells,” he said.
“The second arbitration is against the government seeking compensation from RIL and its partners for producing natural gas belonging to state-owned ONGC,” he added."
57,2018-08-02,ONGC,"PSU makes big gains from higher prices, gas output 


ONGC’s standalone profit in the June 2018 quarter grew a robust 58 per cent year-on-year to ₹6,144 crore. This was primarily due to two factors — better price realisations and higher gas output. These positives more than offset decline in oil production.
Crude oil
The global rally in crude oil over the past year had a positive rub-off effect on ONGC. The company’s crude oil price realisation in dollar terms shot nearly 48 per cent year-on-year — from $46-48 a barrel a year-ago to $68-71 a barrel in the June 2018 quarter. Adding to the benefit was the sharp 5 per cent depreciation of the rupee during the quarter — from 65 to 68.5 a dollar; this translated into a 54 per cent year-on-year increase in the price realisation in terms of rupee. This dwarfed the 3.5 per cent dip in crude oil output in the quarter. ONGC’s gas business also delivered strongly — gaining from increase in both price and output. The formula-linked half-yearly pricing for domestic gas saw ONGC realise $3.06 per mmbtu of gas in the June 2018 quarter, up 23 per cent from $2.48 per mmbtu the year-ago period. And unlike the decline in oil output, the company’s gas output during the quarter was up more than 3 per cent year-on-year. The output of value added products was also up 12 per cent.








 
 
The benefit from higher oil and gas prices, and a weak rupee could continue for the company for two or three quarters more. But this base effect is likely to wear off after that. Output increase will then be the key."

ONGC’s revenue for the quarter under review was ₹27, 213 crore, up 42.7 per cent from ₹19, 073 crore last financial year.

ONGC has reported higher net profit of 58.1 per cent at Rs 6,144 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 against Rs 3,885 crore in the same period previous year.

55,2018-08-06,ONGC,"High operating profit to help ONGC cut borrowings, says Moody’s
 Oil and Natural Gas Corp’s (ONGC) highest ever pre-tax quarterly profit (EBITDA) provides cash flow to the state-owned firm to reduce borrowings, Moody’s Investors Service said today.
For the April-June quarter of the current fiscal, ONGC reported 47.2 per cent increase in EBITDA or operating profit to Rs 14,240 crore.
“The increase in EBITDA was largely driven by higher crude oil prices, as well as the depreciation of the Indian rupee,” Moody’s said.
In a report, the global rating firm said the government has decided against asking ONGC to share in the cost of any fuel subsidies. “If it had done so, such a request could have partly negated the impact of the increase in oil prices.” 
The government’s decision, it said, is credit positive because it provides ONGC with cash flow to reduce its borrowings. ONGC increased its borrowings by about Rs 25,000 crore in January 2018, when it acquired a 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd for Rs 36,915 crore. 
“If oil prices stay above USD 70 per barrel for the remainder of the year and the government refrains from asking ONGC to share the costs of any fuel subsidies, we expect ONGC to generate a consolidated free cash flow of more than Rs 20,000 crore after likely capital spending of Rs 30,000 crore and dividend payments of Rs 9,500 crore. The company could reduce part of its acquisition debt by using this free cash flow,” it said.
The high levels of free cash flow will improve ONGC’s financial flexibility, especially at a time when the company is unlikely to reduce its borrowings by selling its 13.77 per cent stake in Indian Oil Corp (IOC), given that the share prices of IOC have fallen by about 25 per cent since September 1, 2017. ONGC’s 13.77 per cent stake in IOC is currently valued at Rs 22,500 crore.
Moody’s said the government could, however, ask ONGC to share fuel subsidies in the next few quarters or alternatively, look for higher dividends. “Any such move by the government would constrain ONGC’s free cash flow and debt reduction, which will be credit negative,” it said.
The rating agency in its base case assumed an average oil price for the remainder of the year of between USD 45 and USD 65 per barrel and expects ONGC to maintain retained cash flow/net debt above 30 per cent. Debt reduction from free cash flow generation because of high oil prices and the absence of subsidy sharing will provide the company with a buffer to absorb declines in oil prices, it said.
While ONGC has only reported standalone financial results, its consolidated EBITDA—which includes the results of ONGC Videsh Ltd, ONGC’s international exploration and production business—will also benefit from the increase in oil prices.
However, the refining businesses of the company (HPCL and Mangalore Refining and Petrochemical Ltd) will likely report weaker earnings for Q1 019 versus Q4 2018 because regional refining margins were lower by about USD 1 per barrel, Moody’s added."

The government has invited expressions of interest to sell up to 100 per cent stake in Pawan Hans and has set September 12 as the deadline for bids. Earlier, the Centre had wanted to sell its 51 per cent stake along with management control in Pawan Hans. Now, with ONGC also agreeing to sell its 49 per cent stake, the Union Government plans to sell the entire 100 per cent in Pawan Hans, a Cogencis report said quoting the Civil Aviation Ministry web site."
53,2018-08-15,ONGC,"Will HPCL be on par with ‘parent’ ONGC?
 A bumper profit of over ₹6,000 crore for the second straight year has helped State-run oil refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) stake its claim for the coveted ‘maharatna’ status.
However, the ‘maharatna’ status will also put HPCL and its holding company ONGC (already a ‘maharatna’) on a par on decision-making powers. This would further complicate a disinvestment deal from earlier this year when the State-run oil and gas explorer acquired 51.11 per cent of the government’s stake in HPCL for ₹36,915 crore.
HPCL is yet to recognise ONGC as its promoter. 
ONGC is shown to be a public shareholder with 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL, in its most recent share-holding pattern submitted to the Bombay Stock Exchange. ONGC has only one member on HPCL’s board.
For HPCL, a ‘maharatna’ status will potentially curtail ONGC’s powers to take business decisions for the oil marketing company, in which the explorer holds a controlling stake, say oil industry sources.
The ‘maharatna’ status bestows greater freedom from government control for the PSU to incur capital expenditure on purchase of new items, or for replacement, without any monetary ceiling, and to forge technology joint ventures (JVs) or strategic alliances.
The status also allows the PSU to make equity investment to establish financial JVs and wholly-owned subsidiaries, undertake mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in India or abroad, subject to a ceiling of 15 per cent of the net worth of the PSU, and limited to ₹5,000 crore in one project. 
The board of directors of a ‘maharatna’ PSU will also have powers for mergers and acquisitions, subject to the conditions that it should be as per the growth plan and in the core area of functioning of the PSU and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) is informed in case of investments abroad. 
Mumbai-based HPCL posted a net profit of ₹6,357.07 crore for the financial year 2017-18. In fiscal years FY17 and FY16, it had net profits of ₹6,208.80 crore and ₹3,726.16 crore, respectively, thereby enabling the firm to show an average annual net profit of more than ₹5,000 crore for the last three years, one of the six criteria required to become a ‘maharatna’ central public sector enterprise.
The lack of an average annual net profit of more than ₹5,000 crore for the last three years was the only qualification criteria holding up its pursuit of a ‘maharatna’ status.
“HPCL has applied for maharatna status,” a company official said.
HPCL is already a ‘navratna’ PSU with an annual average turnover and net worth for the last three years way above the limit set for ‘maharatna’ companies.
In fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018, HPCL’s turnover from operations was ₹1.97-lakh crore, ₹2.13-lakh crore and ₹2.43-lakh crore, respectively. To become eligible for ‘maharatna’ status, a PSU must have an average annual turnover of more than ₹25,000 crore for 3 years.
The oil refiner also meets the criteria for having an average annual net worth of more than ₹15,000 crore for the last 3 years, besides having significant global presence.
HPCL’s imminent anointment as a ‘maharatna’ PSU will put it in an elite PSU club that includes oil and gas sector compatriots such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd, Gas Authority of India Ltd, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, Coal India Ltd and Steel Authority of India Ltd are the other ‘maharatna’ companies."

 ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) and the Government of Sudan have held talks to mitigate the issue of default on payment dues to OVL.
The talks began on August 7 when a Sudanese Government delegation reached Delhi. An OVL statement said, “It was informed that the Government of Sudan is hopeful that its economic situation shall be improving henceforth with the recent agreement it reached with the Government of South Sudan on resumption of crude oil transportation from South Sudan territory through the Heglig-Port Sudan pipeline.”
OVL had dragged Sudan to an international arbitration court to recover over $ 400-million unpaid oil dues pending since 2011. The claim has been filed in a London court to recover about $ 300 million for the oil Sudan bought from its Greater Nile Oil Project and another $ 98.94 million unpaid pipeline rent lease.
The visiting delegation had requested ONGC Videsh to withdraw the arbitration process instituted against the Government of Sudan.
The OVL statement said, “It was further informed by ONGC Videsh that keeping the legal intricacies in view, the arbitration process can continue while both sides work together on a suitable mechanism for resolving the issues.’’
OVL agreed to depute a team of senior-level officials to Sudan for initiating techno-commercial discussions afresh to workout way forward for the settlement of past dues. Subsequently, the ONGC Videsh team had arrived at Khartoum on August 13 and discussions with the Sudanese side are currently ongoing, the statement added."

The claim has been filed in a London court to recover about $300 million for oil Sudan bought from OVL’s Greater Nile Oil Project and another $98.94 million in unpaid pipeline rent lease. 
Sudan split
The dues started to accumulate when Sudan and South Sudan split in July 2011. After the division, a majority of the crude oil production and reserves were situated in South Sudan. Further, the total production in Sudan was not sufficient to even meet requirements of domestic refineries and eventually, foreign firms were asked to sell their share of crude oil to the government.
But the payment for these crude oil purchases by the Sudan government has been pending since.
The other dues to OVL are for a pipeline, which was handed over to the Sudan government in October 2005. The payment together with lease rent was to be made in 18 equal half yearly instalments from December 2005. The payment was received till December 2010 and the remaining instalments were not honoured.
This prompted OVL to drag Sudan to an arbitration from which the visiting delegation requested OVL to withdraw.
Arbitration proceedings 
The OVL statement, however, noted that the arbitration proceedings will continue for now. OVL said, “It was further informed by ONGC Videsh that keeping the legal intricacies in view, the arbitration process can continue while both sides work together on suitable mechanism of resolving the issues.”
OVL also agreed to depute a team of senior level officials to Sudan for initiating techno-commercial discussions afresh to work out a way forward for settling past dues.

 The government has asked its biggest state-owned firm, Oil and Natural Gas (ONGC), to list its overseas unit ONGC Videsh, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The move to float the unit - which has investments in 11 producing assets in countries including Russia, Brazil and Iran - is part of a government push to sell state-assets to raise funds. A listing would also help unlock value in the unit by improving its corporate governance and efficiency, the letter from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management to ONGC said.
The letter, sent last week, did not state how much of ONGC should be offered to outside investors. The letter said any state-owned firm with a positive net worth and no accumulated loss should be listed to unlock value. The listing would help the government meet its divestment targets and make up for a failed plan earlier this year to sell a stake in national carrier Air India.
The government has a target to raise a record Rs 1 lakh crore ($14.25 billion) from the sale of state assets in the current fiscal year ending in March 2019. India holds a 67.45 per cent stake in ONGC Videsh's parent ONGC and gains from a listing could be transferred to the government via a special dividend.
ONGC Videsh, 100 per cent owned by ONGC, suffered losses during the low crude price environment between 2014 and 2017 but its earnings have since recovered. The firm posted a net profit of $152 million and contributed 5 percent to ONGC's overall net earnings in the latest fiscal year ended March 2018. ONGC Videsh was formed in 1965 to help India expand its overseas footprint."
49,2018-08-28,ONGC,"Open acreage auction: Vedanta bags 41 oil blocks, OIL 9, ONGC 2 
 The Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd has bagged 41 out of 55 oil and gas exploration blocks offered in India’s maiden open acreage auction, upstream regulator DGH said today. 
State-owned Oil India Ltd won nine blocks, while Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) managed to win just two. State gas utility GAIL, the upstream arm of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Oil Exploration Co (HOEC) received one block each, DGH said giving out the list of winners of the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) round-1.
Vedanta, which had put in bids for all the 55 blocks, won the right to explore and produce oil and gas in 41 of them. “We will work hard to make the best of this opportunity. We are an energy-deficient country and policies such as OALP will help reduce the country’s import dependence for oil from around 80 per cent now to 67 per cent by 2022, in line with (the) PM’s vision.
“The development further strengthens our vision to invest in India and contribute 50 per cent of India’s domestic crude oil production. In keeping with our values and ethos, we will continue to focus on sustainability and development expertise for people and communities to enhance lives,” Agarwal said.
At the close of bidding on May 2, ONGC had bid for 37 blocks, either on its own or in consortium with other state-owned firms. OIL had bid for 22 blocks in a similar fashion. Vedanta was the sole bidder for two blocks and had either ONGC or OIL as a direct competitor in the remaining. Except for the two blocks that received three bids each, all the other 53 had just two bidders.
Neither local giants Reliance Industries nor any foreign company participated in the auction, a first since India began offering oil and gas area for exploration and production through bids in 1999.
India had in July last year allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration.
Under this policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting oil and gas in an area that is currently not under any production or exploration licence. The EoIs can be put in at any time of the year, but they are accumulated twice annually.
As many as 55 blocks were sought for prospecting of oil and gas by prospective bidders, mostly by state-owned explorers, ONGC and OIL, and private sector Vedanta by the end of the first EoI cycle on November 15, 2017, official sources said.
The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area, getting a 5-mark advantage. The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq km. This compares to about 1,02,000 sq km being under exploration currently, they said.
Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic surveys and drilling exploration wells. Increased exploration will lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world’s third largest oil importer to cut import dependence.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting the oil import bill by 10 per cent to 67 per cent by 2022 and to half by 2030. Import dependence has increased since 2015, when Modi had set the target. India currently imports 81 per cent of its oil needs.
The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from the production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block.
The government has been selecting and demarcating areas it feels can be offered for bidding in an exploration licensing round. So far 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. The last bid round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded, but as many as 156 have already been relinquished due to poor prospects."

M K Surana, Chairman and Managing Director, HPCL (file pic)


State-run refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) has begun talks with its parent, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC), to merge Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), as it looks to tap benefits accruing from such an exercise, a top company official has said.
“With MRPL, HPCL’s synergies comes by merging the two companies,” said M K Surana, Chairman and Managing Director, HPCL. “Talks are progressing with ONGC on that,” he added. ONGC owns 71.63 per cent in MRPL, in which HPCL has a 16.96 per cent stake.
In January this year, the government sold its 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC for Rs 36,915 crore, throwing up challenges on consolidating many group companies. Post-merger, MRPL fuel stations will get re-branded as HPCL.
“After we merge, there won’t be two separate entities, namely, HPCL and MRPL. HPCL has got a brand value and that brand value has got a number. We have got 15,062 outlets and MRPL has six outlets. So, the logical thing would be that MRPL outlets would be rebranded as HPCL, because MRPL itself will get rebranded in that situation,” Surana said at a media conference on Thursday.
The point, according to Surana, is not what it is (going to be) called. “The question is the synergy which it gives as and when we decide to acquire or merge, whatever it is. There are various options available for doing that, which will be a combination of either cash or swap or a combination of the two, depending on what the two companies decide, because it is not a third entity we are trying to acquire. It is within the group we have to consolidate. So, we need to see the most efficient way of doing that. HPCL only needs to see what brings the best value to the group and to the legal entities involved,” the CMD said.
Explaining the synergies arising from the deal, Surana said there is a “general congruence of thought between all the connected parties that this is the right thing to do, and it will bring value to the group in more than one way”.
The obvious one is HPCL sells more than what it makes. MRPL has a standalone refinery, which assures supply and market. But what is not that obvious is further synergies. Each refinery has got multiple units, the primary distillation, the secondary processing, finishing units and each refinery is designed for certain set of design parameters. But, when you have more than one refinery in the kitty, you can also take advantage of the small questions which you have got in certain intermediate units, and there you can create value by optimised use of the intermediate units, which is one thing that gives additional benefit, he said.
The third is economies of scale. “On the West Coast of India, Mumbai does not have a facility to berth very large crude carriers that bring crude. But, if we are bringing the crude together, we can unload a part of the crude in Mangaluru and then do a lighterage to Mumbai. We can get substantial freight advantage coming up to the Indian coast, only a lit bit is there for the lighterage. Besides, we have got a big R&D facility in Bengaluru, which can be utilised for the whole group. We can optimise the total product slate, total supply logistics, have better logistics advantage, along with other oil marketing companies also, when you have got a product supply position available in different points of the country.
“We also have a joint venture pipeline between ONGC and HPCL, linking Mangaluru-Hassan-Bengaluru, which shifts the products predominantly from Mangaluru refinery/ coast. We are in discussions to integrate these facilities and create value in the overall production, movement, sale and distribution of products,” Surana added. 
He declined to give a time line for the merger. “Because there are three entities involved, it has to be approved by the board of all the three companies and there is also a process that has to be followed, based on the statutory requirements,” he added."
47,2018-09-06,ONGC,"ONGC to open up three more sedimentary basins in next 5 years
 Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is going to open up three more sedimentary basins for commercial oil and gas exploration in the country. The newest basins are the Vindhyan basin in Madhya Pradesh and the Ashok Nagar of 24 Parganas district in West Bengal.
 Speaking at the GEO India 2018 conference, Ajay Kumar Dwivedi, Director (Exploration), said, “The seventh basin was opened way back in 1985. We are looking at adding three more basins in next five years.”
But ,Dwivedi said that these basins can be monetised only if there a relaxation in the present fiscal regime and a higher gas price is allowed. “The present gas price is a challenge for exploration,” he said.
ONGC had till now opened six out of India’s seven producing basins for commercial production. An ONGC statement earlier this year said the company has started the process of adding the Kutch offshore basin. This will be the eighth basin to be added.
India has 26 sedimentary basins, of which only seven have commercial production. ONGC has opened up Cambay, Mumbai Offshore, Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery, and Assam-Arakan Fold Belt Basins. The Assam shelf was opened before Independence."

Shashi Shankar, CMD, ONGC
   -  Kamal Narang




Shashi Shankar, CMD, ONGC
   -  Kamal Narang


 It has been almost six months since the high-profile ₹36,915-crore acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) by ONGC, but the unease at the top management level still continues.
As the promoter and majority stakeholder in HPCL, ideally the top man at ONGC Shashi Shankar should be accepted as the non-executive Chairman of HPCL. But, an anomaly exists till date. 
Reason is simple: the top positions in both the entities are held by individuals of the same rank.
While Mukesh Kumar Surana continues to hold the CMD post in HPCL, Shankar — who is the CMD of ONGC — is yet to gain his position in the refining-cum-retailing major. Shankar holds the top rank in the other two ONGC group entities — ONGC Videsh Ltd and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd.
An industry official in the know told BusinessLine, “this is the most unfortunate part of the deal. The government should have left the house in order —- which means leave the organisational structure in order by defining the role and responsibility clearly.”
Asked why it was important, as long as the Board of the company was in place, the observer said, “In case of disagreement among the board of directors, whose opinion should prevail?”
Explaining that in a Central public sector undertaking, the board of directors is appointed by the government through a Presidential order, the industry official said, in HPCL there were two government nominees. After the stake buy by ONGC, the government withdrew one and replaced the nominee with Director Finance of the oil giant. But, the topmost post still evades ONGC, as its CMD is yet to be accepted in HPCL.
Officials in the two companies do not rule out the possibility that the problem could be because both the CMDs are of same rank and so the issue of who is going to report. But, this has also resulted in creating an uncertainty at the top-level.
“Whose decision should prevail in case of a disagreement? This is an anomaly which the government should have sorted out before leaving. It is a difficult situation. These are commercial organisations so between the group companies if there are differences, whose opinion should prevail and some other questions remain unanswered,” said an oil industry tracker.
Experts and analysts expressed surprise about the ongoing stand off due to HPCL not accepting ONGC as promoter and felt that government must intervene and direct HPCL to rectify the situation as continued confusion will adversely affect the valuation of ONGC and in turn hurt the government interest, being ONGC majority shareholder.
As far as the transaction is concerned, ONGC has paid the entire money to the government to conclude the deal, as the seller is government and buyer is ONGC. The intent behind this deal was to strengthen CPSEs through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, the CPSE can be integrated across the value chain of an industry."

 Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd (ONGC) has sought an exemption from a government request to buy back government-held shares in the company as ONGC needs the funds for its own capital expenditures, Chairman Shashi Shanker said on Wednesday.
This follows local news reports which said the government wants the ONGC to buy back a portion of its 67.45 per cent stake in the company to meet its divestment target."

Accused of being indifferent to the concerns of ‘manpower’ and using its disinvestment schemes simply as a means to meet revenue targets, the government is likely to clearly define the role of the ‘buyer’.
Key sources reveal that the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), Ministry of Finance, will define the role of the ‘acquirer’ in all its future disinvestment proposals.
With the Narendra Modi-led government stepping on the gas to meet its divestment targets and reports of listed state undertakings being called upon to buy other PSUs’ stakes, there is need to have a clear plan for manpower integration.
Last year, ONGC’s acquisition of 51.11 per cent stake of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation helped the government meet its divestment targets but it has also led to an unseemly stand-off between the managements of both the institutions.
The current situation is such that HPCL is not accepting ONGC as the promoter. The trigger for this was the fact that the top positions in both the entities are held by individuals of the same rank. If the role of the acquirer had been defined, such a situation would not have arisen and HPCL would have had to accept ONGC as its promoter.
There is fear of more such cases happening. Consider this: The disinvestment target for FY2018-19 is ₹80,000 crore; the amount raised so far ₹9,220 crore or just 11 per cent of the target. The government hopes that LIC’s acquisition of 51 per cent stake of IDBI will take it closer to its target. Similarly, Coal India stake sale is reportedly in the offing. “We realise that we have to define the role of the acquirer to ensure that a Hindustan Petroleum Corporation-ONGC like situation doesn’t get repeated,” says a senior DIPAM official.
While there is a debate on whether the ONGC-HPCL deal is technically a disinvestment or, for that matter, LIC looking at IDBI Bank or JNPT at assets of Air India, the reality is that such transactions are happening. The harsher fact is that the government does not have an integrated HR Policy in place to tackle such M&As. 
“Shifting stuff from one pocket to another as has been the case of HPCL, where the government offloaded its shares to ONGC, which is promoted by it, is not the true spirit of disinvestment. But, having done so, manpower issues need to be clearly defined, as disinvestment is an ongoing process,” says Pavan Kumar Vijay, Founder of corporate legal advisory firm Corporate Professionals, and a Fellow Member of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India. 
Right now the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, the nodal Ministry, has stepped in to help resolve the situation. The practical way out could be that the government could create an internal arrangement so that the ONGC Chairman can participate in the decision-making process of HPCL, says V.C. Agrawal, former Director of human resources for Indian Oil Corporation. 
Uncertainty clouds the fate of the staff at the PSU banks being merged. Take, for example, the government’s announcement of September 17 regarding amalgamation of Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank, creating a ₹15-lakh crore entity. Post-merger, it will be the third-largest bank in India after State Bank of India and ICICI Bank and will have to deal with over 85,000 employees, across around 9,500 branches.
“Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that nobody will have to worry. But, reality is different. We are talking about 9,000-odd branches. There will be administrative offices that will be closed. There will be transfers. Some will be left with no option but to take voluntary retirement,” points out Ashwani Rana, Vice-President of the National Organisation of Bank Workers.
According to Rana, integration of human resources is a big challenge. “Is there a policy in place to deal with manpower management? The government says the intent is to deal with non-profit asset issues, but is there a record to show that merger or consolidation has helped them achieve this target?” he poses. KKN Kutty, National President, Confederation of Central Government Employees & Workers, says, “If the consolidation, as is the case with SBI and erstwhile associate banks, was to make the bank more profitable, then it hasn’t served the purpose. SBI has reported loss.”
As former ONGC Chairman RS Sharma says, “Manpower integration is very critical, it is part of good corporate governance practice which has to be honoured by everyone. Any board decision has to be taken with the consent of the owner.” Sums up Pavan Vijay, “An HR policy that defines roles — who will play what role after the deal, what system will be followed, who controls the business — is much needed, as mergers and acquisitions do not happen at the snap of a finger.”"

 Domestic oil refiners have drawn up contingency plans to meet the shortfall if crude oil supplies from Iran are slashed.
Speaking on the sidelines of the World Energy Policy Summit, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Chairman and Managing Director, Shashi Shanker, said, “There are contingency plans in place. We have some agreements with different countries.”
Shanker was responding to questions on the way ahead for ONGC’s refinery subsidiaries, HPCL and MRPL, once crude oil supplies from Iran are halted due to the US sanctions. The sanctions kick in from November 4.
“In every long term agreement, there is a minimum offtake quantity plus there is some flexibility. We can draw more from other suppliers because we are not dependent only on Iran,” Shankar explained.
Essentially, the refiners can opt for sourcing more crude oil from their other suppliers. The additional requirement can be met well within the existing terms of agreement.
Assuring that there will not be any shortfall, Director, Refineries at IndianOil, BV Rama Gopal said, “India’s energy demand will be met, with or without Iran.”
Gopal explained that the crude volumes are contracted annually. “The total crude quantity is finalised for the year. So if I lift now more, at the end of the year it has to be slashed,” Gopal said.
Effectively the refiner can buy more volumes of crude earlier during the year and meet the contractual requirements. Similarly, they may also buy lesser crude oil from another contract earlier during the year and then offset any shortfalls later during the year.
 According to data released by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS), India’s crude oil imports from Iran rose by 43.72 per cent to 2.07 million tonnes (mt) in August.
Cumulatively, India’s oil imports from Iran in the first five months (April to August) of this financial year rose 43.69 per cent to 13.32 mt against 9.26 mt imported during the same period a year ago.
But does this mean that crude oil supplies from Iran to India will be stopped completely?
Not so, according to Shanker. He said, “Based on the past experience I can say that cutting to zero is unlikely.” “What is going to happen from today regarding supplies from Iran is not clear. As of now, no significant steps are being taken. We are adopting a wait-and-watch approach,” Gopal added."
42,2018-09-28,ONGC,"Crude oil prices may firm up further: ONGC Chairman


The price of crude oil may rise further on global cues said ONGC Chairman, Shashi Shanker. Speaking at ONGC’s 25th Annual General Meeting, Shanker said, “Today Brent Crude is selling for $75 a barrel and could go even higher as Iran approaches another era of sanctions and Venezuela grapples with rapidly declining production.”
“Within a period of two years, the trajectory of prices has changed dramatically. A barrel of crude in early 2016 fetched just about $30 and by the end of 2017 it had already more than doubled,” he said.
Speaking with shareholders on ONGC’s prospects, Shanker said, “Despite the growth of renewables, hydrocarbons will remain extremely vital for feeding the growing energy requirements of the country as well as the world…We will retain our focus on exploration and production as the primary avenue of business growth in the foreseeable future.”
Shanker said the company will focus on lowering the finding costs to boost prospects. He said, “The era of easy oil is over. Finding and producing oil and gas economically has become difficult. ONGC is addressing this challenge with a cost-effective, operationally efficient and technology-led approach. At just over $6 per barrel of oil equivalent, our finding costs are more competitive globally and our aim is to bring it down further.”"
41,2018-09-30,ONGC,"US, Japanese, Middle Eastern firms interested in OPaL stake 
 Global giants from US, Japan and the Middle East have shown interest in picking up a stake in state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp’s (ONGC) mega petrochemical project in Gujarat, the firm’s Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker said.
 ONGC Petro additions Ltd’s (OPaL) 1.1 million tonnes plant was completed last year at a cost of Rs 30,000 crore. “The plant is operating at 80 per cent capacity and is targeted to reach 100 per cent before end of current fiscal,” Shanker said.
 While the plant was originally conceived as a joint venture with state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd and Gujarat State Petroleum Corp Ltd (GSPC), ONGC funded most of the project cost.
 ONGC is now looking at restructuring the equity of OPaL and is exploring the option of roping in a foreign partner. “Many people across the globe have shown interest in taking stake. Many options are available,” he said. “Companies from Middle East, Japan and US have shown interest.” 
 He, however, did not name the companies. Saudi Aramco is said to be one of the companies interested in taking a stake in OPaL.
 “By February we should be able to get a fix on the whole thing,” he said.
 ONGC was originally supposed to keep just 26 per cent stake in OPaL while gas utility GAIL was to take 19 per cent. Five per cent was to be taken by Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) and the remaining was to be sold to a strategic investor and public.
 But GAIL ended up paying for only 9 per cent and GSPC for only 0.2 per cent. The remaining cost was borne by ONGC.
 GAIL had in 2008 picked up 19 per cent stake in OPaL, which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat.
 But the project, which started in 2006, faced major cost and time overruns, which forced GAIL to restrict its equity contribution to the original Rs 996.28 crore.
 This investment in the expanded project cost meant that the gas utility’s stake dropped first to 17 per cent, then to 15.5 per cent and now about 9 per cent.
 The project at the time of conception was projected to cost Rs 12,440 crore but the cost was in 2010 revised to Rs 19,535 crore. It was a couple of years later further revised upwards to Rs 21,396 crore with December 2013 set as the commissioning date. It was completed last year for Rs 30,000 crore.
 GAIL would, however, continue to hold rights to market 38 per cent of the polymer and other chemicals produced by OPaL even at the reduced equity stake.
 ONGC had attributed the increase in project cost primarily to additional cost of Phase-II captive power plant and increase in cost of building the Phase-I electricity generating unit.
 OPaL aims to export products overseas to markets such as Africa, China, Singapore, Turkey, Pakistan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka."
40,2018-10-01,ONGC,"ONGC wants ‘tight’ reservoir gas priced on par with ‘difficult’ ones
ONGC has approached the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas to allow gas produced from tight reservoirs to be sold on par with that from other ‘difficult’ discoveries.
“We ecently found gas deposits in a block in the Vindhyan basin in Madhya Pradesh. It is a tight gas reservoir and it is not commercially feasible to develop this asset at the present gas price,” an ONGC official told BusinessLine.
The Ministry has fixed the gas price for the October 1, 2018 - March 31, 2019 period at $3.36 a unit (gas is measured in million British thermal units, or mBtu). But for gas produced from ‘difficult’ discoveries, such as those in deep water, ultra deepwater and high pressure/high temperature areas, a price of $7.67/mBtu is allowed.
“We want gas discoveries from tight gas reservoirs to be categorised with other difficult discoveries. We have already made presentations to the Ministry of Petroleum,” the official said.
A reservoir is considered ‘tight’ if the oil or gas is covered by harder rocks that require more expensive drilling and extraction techniques.
Gas price is governed by the New Domestic Gas Policy, 2014, under which the Centre fixes the price twice a financial year — for April-September and October-March.
Allowing tight gas reservoirs to get a higher price will require the Union Cabinet’s nod, the official added.
At present, ONGC annually produces 32.65 billion cubic metres of natural gas. Of this, 3 million standard cubic metre a day of production comes from the ONGC S1 Vasishta project in the Eastern Offshore. This is ONGC’s only project that is getting a higher price. “Going forward, we plan to increase production from Vasishta S1 to 4 million standard cubic metres a day,” said ONGC Chairman Shashi Shanker."
39,2018-10-02,ONGC,"ONGC not in a hurry to offload stake in IOC, GAIL
 State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is not in a hurry to sell its stake in Indian Oil Corp and GAIL (India) and will wait for the right price before offloading the shares, a senior company official said.
 ONGC holds 13.77 per cent stake in oil refiner IOC and 4.86 per cent in gas utility GAIL India.
“It is true that we are now a fully integrated company. We are India’s largest oil and gas producer and the acquisition of (oil refiner) HPCL has extended our presence in the downstream industries. And so naturally, it now does not make sense for ONGC to hold stake in Indian Oil Corp (IOC). But, we will wait for the right price,” said the official.
 ONGC, he said, got over Rs 3,000 crore in dividend income from investments in IOC and GAIL in 2017-18 financial year. “This is a decent return on capital and can help me hold on to shares for long,” he said. “I am in no hurry to sell the stake. We will wait for the right price.” 
ONGC’s 13.77 per cent stake in IOC at Monday’s closing price of Rs 153.80 apiece on BSE is worth over Rs 20,500 crore. Its 4.86 per cent stake in GAIL is worth close to Rs 4,200 crore at Monday’s closing price of Rs 380.75. “IOC shares were trading at around Rs 195 in January and are now at Rs 153-154. It doesn’t make sense to sell the shares at such a big loss,” the official said.
 ONGC, he said, is generating enough surplus mainly because of international oil prices spiking to four-year high and the rupee plummeting to an all-time low. It is using these to pay off Rs 24,881 crore loan it had taken to buy Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,915 crore. A third of the loan has already been pre-paid, he said.
 ONGC had borrowed Rs 24,881 crore on a short-term loan to fund buying of the government’s 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL. The remaining came from its cash reserves.
 The official said the pace of repayment may slow down in the third and fourth quarters owing to outgo on taxes and dividend as also the fact that capital spending would peak by then. Initially, ONGC considered selling its stake in IOC and GAIL to fund the acquisition, but it has never found the right price to offload the shares, he said. The short-term loan ONGC availed had a provision to prepay without any penalty.
 ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) for selling IOC and GAIL shares but the state-owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10 per cent discount to the prevailing price. ONGC thus decided against the share sale.
 ONGC’s purchase of HPCL created India’s first integrated oil company. This was ONGC’s biggest acquisition and second buyout of 2017-18 after its Rs 7,738 crore acquisition of 80 per cent stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp’s KG basin gas block. HPCL added 23.8 million tonne of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC’s portfolio, making it the third largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.
 ONGC already is majority owner of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, which has a 15-million tonne refinery."

Shares of oil marketing companies tumbled as much as 29 per cent in the morning trade as the government had on Thursday announced a lowering of excise duty by ₹1.50 a litre. 
It also asked the public sector oil marketing companies — Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation — to cut prices by ₹1 a litre. These measures will bring down petrol and diesel prices by ₹5 per litre. 
Following the announcement, shares of oil marketing companies (OMCs) lost significant ground. Brokers said the downtrend was a knee-jerk reaction. Market experts said the fuel price cut would have negative implications for upstream public sector companies.

On the NSE, too, all the three oil marketing companies fell to their 52-week low level.

ONGC issued 14-day notice to Mercator Oil & Gas to terminate the contract
   -  PTI


 ONGC Ltd terminated a $152-million contract awarded to Mercator Oil & Gas Ltd in 2011 for converting its offshore drilling rig, Sagar Samrat, into a mobile offshore production unit.
The rig-conversion contract was to be completed by May 2013 as per the original timeline stipulated in the November 2011 deal. The 69-month delay has raised the project cost by 46 per cent to Rs. 1,256.72 crore, according to a status report of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
ONGC has so far spent Rs. 1,195.34 crore on the contract which is expected to be completed by December this year. 
Sagar Samrat is India’s and ONGC’s first drilling rig, built in 1973 by Japanese firm Mitsubishi. 
ONGC took delivery of the jack-up rig in 1974 and after drilling 131 wells, the rig was decommissioned in 2005.
Mercator Oil & Gas is a unit of Mumbai-listed Mercator Ltd.
 In September, ONGC notified Mercator Oil & Gas of its intention to terminate the contract after issuing 14 days’ notice and also moved to encash the bank guarantee of $15 million submitted by the contractor through Axis Bank.
On 26 September, Justice S J Kathawalla of the Bombay High Court ordered Axis Bank not to make payment to ONGC upon invocation of bank guarantee on a petition by Mercator Oil & Gas. 
On October 9, the court heard the petition again and decided to continue with its earlier order till the case was disposed. “ The Company (ONGC) is left with no choice but to terminate the contract,” said Ved Prakash, a general manager at ONGC in the October 10 termination letter to Mercator Oil & Gas.
The termination will deepen the woes of Mercator whose short-term and long-term bank facilities were recently downgraded by Care Ratings due to delays/defaults in debt servicing on the term loans rated by Care, due to cash flow mismatch. 
The parent company, Mercator has given a corporate guarantee for the conversion contract and ONGC has indicated that it will recover liquidated damages from the contractor. 
“Mercator has claimed that the project had achieved 95 per cent completion for more than six months.This rig is to be used as a production platform and per day loss because of the non-availability of this rig is 15,000 barrels of oil. That is why ONGC was concerned about the return of MODU back to production,” said Prakash.
“Mercator’s intention to go to Court was to stall the pay-out arising from the invocation of bank guarantee,” he said.
He stated, “ONGC informed Mercator of its intent to terminate the contract with 14 days curating period. Its proposal is not viable and they are sitting on the project for more than two years in spite of repeated requests to complete the project.” 
The delay has been attributed to the increase in scope of work post-award of contract due to legs of Sagar Samrat failing in in-place analysis as per ABS guidelines necessitating replacement of all its four legs, delay in procurement of steel and slow progress of fabrication of legs by the contractor."

Methane gas plant (file photo) - By Special Arrangement


 The Coal Ministry has identified 11 mines to produce coal bed methane (CMB). Of these, 10 will be worked on jointly by ONGC and Coal India Ltd (CIL), and the two will also work on one mine with SAIL. 
“It was decided in a meeting last week that ONGC and CIL will partner to produce CBM from 10 new mines that Coal India will open. Initially, ONGC will harness the gas and then CIL will extract coal from them…the first agreement for harnessing CBM through this route is expected to be signed as early as next month,” a Coal Ministry official told BusinessLine.
“In addition to the mines with CIL, the two (ONGC and CIL) will also help develop Steel Authority of India Limited’s Parbatpur coal block. Here, too, ONGC will first harness the CBM,” the official said.
“SAIL had surrendered the Sitanala and Parbatpur coal mines this year. We levied a penalty on SAIL for not making progress on the Sitanala coal mine. But we told SAIL to keep the Parbatpur coal mine and to attempt coal extraction with the support of ONGC and CIL,” he added. In its representations while surrendering the Parbatpur mine, SAIL had said there was a reduction in the area available for coal mining due to overlapping of mining area. SAIL had engaged MECON to prepare a techno commercial viability report, which declared the project unviable. The SAIL board had then decided to return the Parbatpur mine to the Coal Ministry on March 1.
Commenting on the present coal demand, another Coal Ministry official said the committed demand is being met. “The country’s coal supply is meeting 97-98 per cent of the annual contracted quantity. We are meeting a demand of 1.4 million tonnes per day and the coal production is growing at 10.5 per cent. As per the thermal programme, we are meeting 99 per cent of the coal demand,” he said.
“The demand for thermal power has been unprecedented. The country’s GDP grew roughly 7 per cent since 2015. But coal demand did not keep pace during 2015 and 2016. Now the coal production has been growing,” he added."

34,2018-11-03,ONGC,"ONGC posts 61% rise in Q2 net at ₹8,265 cr 
 State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) Saturday reported a 61 per cent jump in its September quarter net profit as higher prices offset a dip in oil production.
 Its net profit was ₹8,265 crore in July-September as compared to ₹5,131 crore in the same period last year, the company said in a statement.
The company got $73.07 for every barrel of crude oil it produced and sold in the second quarter, up 48 per cent from $49.43 per barrel realisation a year ago.
Because of the depreciation in rupee, ONGC’s realisation soared 61 per cent to ₹5,117 per barrel. ONGC bills its customers in US dollars.
It got $3.05 per million British thermal unit for natural gas as against $2.48 per mmBtu last year.
The PSU oil major’s turnover was up 47.6 per cent to ₹27,989 crore.
Oil production fell 7 per cent to 4.9 million tonnes but gas output was up 3 per cent at 6.1 billion cubic metres.
 ONGC reasoned the decline to contractor not delivering a production unit for western offshore WO-16 Cluster.
 Non-delivery of the facility, which was scheduled to come at the beginning of the fiscal year, “led to a loss of oil production of about 0.35 million tonnes”, ONGC said.
 “ONGC took stringent action to terminate the contract and pro-actively awarded a new contract recently for commissioning of (the facility) by March 2019,” the statement said.
 In WO-16 Cluster, all the 15 wells have been completed, which will be put on production once the Mobile Offshore Production Unit (MOPU) for oil production is commissioned, it said.
 “ONGC gas production has seen an increasing trend on year on year basis. The gas production has increased by about 3 per cent in first half of 2018-19” to 12 billion cubic meters, the statement said.
 “The gas production is expected to increase further with the completion of Daman Development Project in Western Offshore and further increase from VA-S1 field in Eastern Offshore,” it said."
33,2018-11-12,ONGC,"ONGC ordered to pay wharfage compensation to Mumbai Port Trust

 State-owned oil and gas explorer, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC), has been ordered to pay arrears of ₹173.69 crore to Mumbai Port Trust as wharfage compensation for the transportation of crude oil through two pipelines it had laid within the limits of the state-run port.
The wharfage compensation payable by ONGC according to a 28 January 2005 agreement signed with Mumbai Port Trust was approved by the Tariff Authority for Major Ports or TAMP, the rate regulator for major ports such as Mumbai, with retrospective effect on a proposal filed by Mumbai Port Trust.
“ONGC shall pay to the Mumbai Port Trust a compensation at one half (1/2) of wharfage rate as applicable on the per tonne of crude oil which will be imported into the Port of Mumbai through all or any of these ONGC pipelines and which will not be exported through the Mumbai Port Trust marine oil terminal, Jawahar Dweep or through any other existing and future oil, gas or chemical terminals of the Port,” TAMP wrote in its 03 October order.
The TAMP order settles a long-running dispute between two state-run firms over wharfage levied on the two pipelines, each stretching 19.5 km, within Mumbai Port Trust limits.
The Mumbai Port Trust said that as per the terms and conditions of the agreement entered between ONGC and MBPT, ONGC has committed to pay wharfage compensation to the Port Trust.
ONGC paid the wharfage compensation charges till fiscal year 2014, but discontinued payment from then on citing that such a levy, apart from being “unreasonable”, did not have the sanction of the rate regulator for major ports and hence, Mumbai Port Trust was “not authorized to levy compensation on ONGC”, according to documents reviewed by BusinessLine.
ONGC further contented that Section 38 of the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963, is applicable for sea going vessels for goods and passengers, whereas, crude oil is transported from Mumbai High field to Uran plant by pipelines and it is not brought to the Port and the Port Trust has not created any facility for receipt of crude oil from offshore fields of ONGC. The oil explorer also argued that it signed the 2005 agreement with Mumbai Port Trust “under duress and without full consent.” 
“But, the ONGC was not obliged to accept such agreement if it did not want to. The intention of Mumbai Port Trust to levy the wharfage compensation charge was known to the ONGC way back in 2003 itself,” the TAMP order read. “Having signed the agreement, the ONGC cannot, at this stage, argue that it signed the agreement under duress and without consent,” it said 
“Agreement has been made between both the parties who have intended to bind together to serve the interest of both the parties. When a binding agreement is not honoured by one party to the agreement by non-performance there is breach of agreement. The other party is discharged from its obligation under the agreement and it is entitled to rescind the agreement which would affect the oil industry. The MBPT, as a responsible public authority, has chosen not to rescind the agreement,’ TAMP wrote in its order."
32,2018-11-21,ONGC,"ONGC gas production at all-time high of 70 mmscmd

 State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp’s (ONGC) natural gas production has hit an all-time high of about 70 million standard cubic meters per day as it doubles up efforts to raise domestic output to curb imports, sources privy to the development said.
ONGC produced about 64 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of gas in November last year and this year the output is close to touching 70 mmscmd, sources said. After accounting for internal consumption, gas sales at about 56 mmscmd too are at an all-time high.
The output can rise by 24-25 mmscmd in next one or two years if the company gets market price, that will make about 35 billion cubic meters of recoverable reserves in discoveries in the shallow sea off Andhra Pradesh on the east and off Gujarat and Mumbai on the west coast blocks economically viable.
Natural gas is the fastest growing primary energy source in the world. It is the cleanest burning petroleum-based fuel and has wide applications—from being used to generate electricity to the running of automobiles (CNG) and firing kitchen stoves.
With a view to reducing dependence on imports for meeting energy needs and cutting greenhouse emissions, India is looking at increasing consumption of natural gas by more than doubling its share in energy basket to 15 per cent in next few years.
Sources said, ONGC has been constrained by the current USD 3.36 per million British thermal unit price of gas fixed by the government, which is a third of the rate at which India imports gas in its liquid form (LNG). 
This price is way below the cost of production for block GK-28/42 in Gulf of Kutch, off the Gujarat coast, Mumbai offshore block MB-OSN-2005/1 and Krishna Godavari basin block KG-OSN-2005/1, which cumulatively can produce about 10 mmscmd.
A similar amount of gas can come from onland discoveries and another 5 mmscmd can be added if investment to made in redevelopment projects of Mumbai High South, Neelam and B-127 cluster are made economical with the market price, they said.
ONGC had in 2017-18 fiscal year, produced 23.484 billion cubic meters of natural gas, 6.3 per cent higher than 22.099 bcm output in the previous 2016-17 financial year. This was the highest gas output by the company in five years and the growth rate was higher than the global average of 3-4 per cent year-on-year.
Sources said the company has stepped up efforts to bring newer fields into production after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a stiff target of reducing oil import dependence by 10 per cent by 2022. India currently imports over 80 per cent of its oil needs.
The growth in output was largely contributed by C-26 Cluster fields, Daman and Vasai East fields in the western offshore as well as sub-sea well S2AB in the eastern offshore, sources said adding ONGC has charted out a plan to double the gas production at 42.7 bcm by 2021-22.
It is investing Rs 57,000 crore, one of the highest investments in the world in gas projects, in the high potential KG-DWN-98/2 project in the Bay of Bengal as well as in developing other discoveries on off the west coast. First gas from the KG-DWN-98/2 project is targeted for end-2019 and peak output is envisaged at 16.56 mmscmd by 2022."
31,2018-11-25,ONGC,"Ahead of polls, govt allows OMCs to open over 55,000 new fuel pumps 
 Ahead of the general elections next year, the government for the first time in the last four years allowed the state-run oil marketing companies to go for a massive expansion of their retail operations by opening close to 56,000 new fuel pumps across the country.
 The move will boost employment generation by thousands and an investment of thousands of crores of rupees.
 For the first time, the OMCs have invited bids from private players online to ensure transparency and the bidding process would be conducted by an independent agency.
 The expansion of the network is being undertaken by state run OMCs including Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and the ONGC-run Hindustan Petroleum. This will cover around 80 per cent of the total locations.
“For a fast growing economy like ours, energy needs are growing manifold and state run OMCs are undertaking retail network expansion in tandem with the growth in demand of petrol and diesel,” an IOCL official Parth Vora told reporters here.
 Today, around 55,000 fuel pumps are run by OMCs, of which nearly 50 per cent belongs to IOCL. Among the private players, Nyara Energy (formerly Essar Oil) runs more than 3,500 fuel pumps and Reliance has around 600 pumps, while other foreign players such as BP and Shell runs 100 pumps each.
 According to statistics, retail sales of petrol and diesel are increasing at the rate of 8 per cent and 4 per cent per annum, respectively.
 Vora further said applications for 55,649 outlets have been issued.
“This expansion has been undertaken to meet the growing fuel needs and convenience of customers in emerging markets like the upcoming highways, agricultural pockets and industrial hubs,” he said.
 The retail outlet network in rural, remote and far flung areas are also expanded with the intention of reaching the product, ensuring quality and correct price to meet the rural agricultural demand and people living in remote areas, Vora added. These new outlets will be opened through the next three years."
30,2018-12-01,ONGC,"Microsoft top recruiter at IIT-Madras


IIT Madras placements began on a high note with 19 companies, including Microsoft, Google, Apple, Airbus and McKinsey, making 85 offers (six international) in the first session of day one.
All the top three global consulting majors McKinsey, The Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Co recruited on the campus and accounted for 13 offers in the first session, says a press release from IIT Madras.
Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) have already recruited four and three candidates respectively.
Microsoft gave the highest number of offers – 25 for three profiles. The other recruiters with large selections were Goldman Sachs (7) and Apple (8).
In the second slot, 23 companies with 48 profiles are scheduled to participate. These companies include Airbus, Shell, JP Morgan, Star India, Intel, Qualcomm and General Electric, the release said.
Manu Santhanam, Advisor, Training and Placement, IIT Madras, said that the number of finance / analytics offers has been excellent in the first slot with 29 offers being made by such firms. With the high profile recruiters in the next slot, 'we hope to improve on our day 1 numbers as compared to the last year.'
This year, over 1,300 students are registered for placement across different streams of study. There are more than 490 profiles from nearly 326 companies that are planning to visit campus in the first phase of placements that lasts until December 8.
Alekhya Reddy from Computer Science and Engineering Department, who got an international offer, said, it was an exhilarating experience of attending interviews of software giants, answering back-to-back nerve-wracking coding questions. “I am experiencing a sense of satisfaction that all my hard work has paid off on getting selected for Microsoft, Redmond Campus in the US”
Advaith Sridhar from Electrical Engineering Department, who got placed in Flipkart, said, “Placements has been a whirlwind process for me. Five months of work culminating in one day can be intensely stressful but the placement arrangements smoothened the way for us (students). ”"

28,2018-12-09,ONGC,"PMO seeks whitepaper on OVL, future strategy 


ovl




ovl


 After looking to sell oilfields of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has sought a whitepaper on status and future strategy for the state-owned firm’s overseas arm ONGC Videsh Ltd, sources with knowledge of the development said.
The government had on previous occasions looked at hiving off the highly successful OVL from its parent and monetising it by listing the firm on domestic or international bourses.
Sources said at the meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review the oil and gas sector on October 12, the Oil Ministry was asked to prepare an in-house white paper on OVL looking into various issues, including reasons for its establishment, cost incurred and returns till date.
Also, the whitepaper was to look at future strategy of OVL so as to maximise returns and issues related to equity oil (the proportion of production that a concession owner has the legal right to retain).
OVL, which is 100 per cent owned by ONGC, has so far invested ₹1.5 lakh crore ($28.36 billion) in 41 projects across 20 countries. It has under its portfolio reserves of 711 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent natural gas.
Sources said at the October 12 meeting, which was also attended by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, a six-member panel headed by NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar was set up to look at ways of enhancing output from the existing 66 oilfields that produce about 95 per cent of domestic crude, including by giving out stake to private and foreign companies.
 The committee, which also comprises Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, Oil Secretary M M Kutty, Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg and ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker, would also look at models like outright sale for the remaining 149 oilfields that produce about 5 per cent of domestic crude oil, they said.
At the meeting, Kutty gave a presentation on the status of oil and gas exploration and production in India.
 It was suggested at the meeting that the 149 smaller fields could be given out to private and foreign firms and ONGC could concentrate on the big ones where it could rope in technology partners through production enhancement contracts (PEC) or technical service arrangements.
This is the second attempt of by the Oil Ministry to take away some of the fields of state-owned ONGC for giving to private and foreign companies.
In October last year, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had identified 15 producing fields with collective reserves of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas of national oil companies for handing over to private firms in the hope they would improve upon the baseline estimate and extraction.
The plan, however, could not go through as ONGC strongly countered the DGH proposal with its own proposal that it be allowed to outsource operations on same terms as the government plan.
The government is giving pricing and marketing freedom to private operators while ONGC is forced to sell natural gas at rates that are well below cost.
Sources said a few months back the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) had written to ONGC management seeking listing of OVL to help unlock value by improving its corporate governance and efficiency.
 ONGC had helped the government meet its disinvestment target last fiscal when it bought a 51.11 percent stake in state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,915 crore.
 After failing to find a buyer for Air India, DIPAM was looking at ONGC to meet the Rs 80,000 crore revenue mobilisation target set out for it in the Budget for 2018-19 from the sale of government stake in PSUs.
 In the letter, DIPAM said PSUs with a positive network and no accumulated losses should be listed to unlock value. It, however, did not state how much stake in OVL should be sold for its listing.
 Market regulator Sebi calls for a minimum 25 percent public float for a listed company.
 Sources said proceeds of the listing of OVL would accrue to its parent ONGC but the government would seek a special dividend to reap that.
The government owns 67.45 per cent stake in ONGC. If ONGC were to declare entire proceeds of OVL listing as a special dividend, the government would get 67.45 per cent of the amount.
 In 2017-18, OVL produced 9.35 million tonnes of crude oil, up from 8.43 million tonnes in the previous year. Together with natural gas, the output was 14.16 million tonnes of oil equivalent, up from 12.80 million tonnes in the previous year.
 It reported a net profit of Rs 981 crore on a turnover of Rs 10,418 crore in 2017-18 fiscal. This compared with a net profit of Rs 701 crore on a turnover of Rs 10,080 crore in the previous fiscal.
 It had reported a net loss of Rs 3,633 crore in 2015-16 due to a sharp drop in oil prices."
26,2018-12-14,ONGC,"OPaL raises ₹335 cr via NCD


ONGC Petro additions Limited (OPaL) — a joint venture between ONGC and GAIL (India) and co-promoted by Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) — on Friday said it has successfully completed its maiden issuance of listed Non-convertible debentures. The company raised ₹335 crore at the coupon rate of 8.60 per cent with a tenure of 3 years and 3 months. The primary objective is to retire the short-term loans and meet the medium-term funding needs to stabilise the petrochemicals operations. According to a top official at OPaL, the company is in the process of raising ₹3,000 crore over the next six months to one year through multiple tranches."

 State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on Friday said its board will consider buyback of company shares at a meeting on December 20.
This follows government pushing cash-rich PSUs to use their funds to buyback shares or pay a higher dividend. The government is looking to bridge budgetary deficit through higher receipts of dividend as well as selling its shares in PSUs in the buyback programmes.
Stock buybacks refer to the repurchasing of shares by the company that issued them. A buyback occurs when the issuing company pays shareholders the market value per share and re-absorbs that portion of its ownership that was previously distributed among public and private investors.
In a regulatory filing, ONGC said: “The meeting of Board of Directors of the company will be held on Thursday, December 20, 2018, inter-alia, to consider the proposal for buy-back of the fully paid-up equity shares of the company.” 
The government holds 67.48 per cent stake in India’s largest oil and gas producer ONGC.
Just on Thursday, state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) said it will buy back 29.76 crore shares for about ₹ 4,435 crore and spend another ₹ 6,556 crore on paying an interim dividend to shareholders.
 The board on Thursday approved buyback of up to 29.76 crore equity shares, or 3.06 per cent, at ₹149 per share.
 The government, which holds a 54.06 per cent stake in the company, is expected to participate in the share buyback.
 The government is targeting a minimum ₹5,000 crore through share buyback offers of state-owned firms like Coal India, BHEL and Oil India Ltd.
 Besides IOC, at least half a dozen other central PSUs have disclosed share buyback programmes. Prominent among these include NHPC, BHEL, NALCO, NLC, Cochin Shipyard and KIOCL that could fetch the government a little over Rs 3,000 crore.
 The government is expected to participate in each of the share buyback programme of these PSUs.
 IOC had also stated that its board has declared an interim dividend of 67.5 per cent or ₹ 6.75 per share for fiscal 2018-19.
 The total dividend payout, excluding tax, would be ₹6,556 crore, of which the government will get ₹3,544 crore plus the dividend distribution tax.
 Last month, Oil India Ltd announced a buyback of 5.04 crore of its share for a little over ₹1,085 crore.
 The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which has been set a target to raise ₹80,000 crore for the government through stake sale in central public sector enterprises, had prodded all cash-rich PSUs to go for share buybacks.
 PSUs having a net worth of at least ₹2,000 crore and a cash balance of more than ₹1,000 crore have to mandatorily go in for share buyback.
 Of the₹80,000 crore disinvestment target, the government has so far raised just over ₹15,000 crore through minority stake sale in PSUs."

 Union Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said that state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) spent over Rs 13,000 crore on 115 oil and gas discoveries. He said that these discoveries were taken away from them by the government for auctioning to private companies.
The present BJP-led NDA government took away so-called idle small and marginal discoveries of ONGC and OIL and auctioned them to private firms under Discovered Small Field (DSF) bid rounds.
Under DSF bid round-1, 67 discoveries, mostly of ONGC, were auctioned, while in the second round, bids for which are due next month, another 48 finds are being auctioned, he said in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha.
“As informed by ONGC, an amount of Rs 12,826 crore has been spent by ONGC on the discoveries/fields identified in the first and second round of Discovered Small Field Policy. An amount of Rs 224.27 crore has been spent by OIL in this regard,” he said.
ONGC and OIL are not compensated for the amount they had spent on discoveries of these oil and gas reserves. Unlike state-owned firms, the private players are allowed pricing and marketing freedom to make these discoveries viable. ONGC and OIL have stated that they could not produce from the discoveries as they are uneconomically at current cap prices.
“With a view to increasing domestic production of oil and gas, the government in May 2016 launched Discovered Small Field Bid Round-I under which 67 discoveries of ONGC and OIL, which had not been put into production, were offered for auction through international competitive bidding,” Pradhan said. “The policy has now been extended to its second round to include 48 un-monetised discoveries of ONGC and OIL under DSF Bid Round-II.” 
Under DSF-I, 47 companies participated in the bidding process, he said.
ONGC and OIL were also allowed to participate in the auction to get back their own discoveries.
“The 67 discoveries under DSF Bid Round-1 are estimated to have in place reserves of 86 million tonne of oil and gas equivalent. In DSF-II, 48 discoveries of ONGC/OIL offered for bid are estimated to have in place reserves of 163.08 million tonne of oil and gas equivalent,” he said.
Pradhan said the government has notified the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) on March 30, 2016, which is based on revenue sharing model wherein explorers offering a higher share of oil and gas to the government are awarded blocks.
The salient feature of HELP include single license for exploration and production of conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons like shale oil, he said adding also included in HELP is an Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) wherein investors can carve out the area of their interest for exploration and production of oil and gas and submit expression of interest throughout the year.
HELP has easy to administer revenue sharing model and marketing and pricing freedom for crude oil and natural gas has been guaranteed for operators. Also, it provides for zero royalty rates for deepwater and ultra-deepwater blocks for first seven years, he added."

A view of Olinda Star, a 35-year-old semi-submersible drilling platform, operating off the coast of Kakinada listing under Phethai impact




A view of Olinda Star, a 35-year-old semi-submersible drilling platform, operating off the coast of Kakinada listing under Phethai impact


Rig-hiring rules of the State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) has been called into question after ‘Olinda Star’, a 35-year-old semi-submersible drilling platform, operating in the KG Block basin off the coast of Kakinada tilted during the latest cyclone, and its 120-odd crew were evacuated to the shore on Tuesday by two platform supply vessels operating in the area. 
The incident has not yet been reported by the country’s biggest oil and gas explorer, the directorate general of hydrocarbons, the Coast Guard or the rig owner. 
 ‘Olinda Star’, built in 1983, is owned by Brazilian driller QGOG and is capable of drilling in depths of up to 600 metres. It started on a three-year contract with ONGC in January this year, on a day rate of $127,714.
Of the six drilling rigs working in Kakinada, only ‘Olinda Star’ was hit by Cyclone Phethai.
‘Olinda Star’ tilted possibly due to dislocation of one or more of its anchors, its anchor moorings broke, and suffered hull damage due to which water seeped into the hull. 
Industry sources blame ONGC’s decision to alter the rig hiring rules in 2014 for the mishap, stating that the new rules focussed more on the commercial aspects than on safety to reap the benefits of a global oversupply of rigs to secure much lower rates. 
“As a result, India in general and ONGC in particular became a dumping ground for old rigs such as ‘Olinda Star’ by foreign owners,” said an industry executive. 
ONGC runs eight rigs of its own and the rest are chartered from fleet owners. Currently, the jack-up rigs hired by ONGC have an average age of 39 years. 
In 2006, ONGC realised the need to modernise its fleet to meet the surge in workload and decided to issue annual tenders to hire jack-up rigs and asked bidders to come forward and build rigs to suit the specifications of ONGC. 
Rig contractors were given incentives such as longer mobilisation period of 18-24 months and a five-year contract instead of the earlier three years at international competitive market rate to build new rigs and this process continued till 2014. 
Between 2006 and 2014, nine jack-up rigs were built by Indian contractors under this strategy. 
In 2014, ONGC changed the rig modernisation strategy after seeing a big crash in the rig market coupled with huge availability of jack-up rigs worldwide. Thus, global rig contractors started dumping their junk rigs in India aided by lack of cabotage protection for local fleet owners for drilling rigs in Indian waters, the industry executive said.
The Quality, Cost, Based Selection (QCBS) of ONGC, a complex formula that took a year to write, gave 25 per cent weightage to technical and 75 per cent to commercial aspects. But, in effect, the technical weightage given is only 7.5 per cent. This translates into a cost difference of as much as $1,500 a day between a modern rig and one built 40 years ago. 
“The outcome of the tender process is that it has failed to attract new rigs. It is becoming a market for junk rigs. The new rigs are forced to remain idle or compete with old ones of 40 years at day rate of $25,000 that covers only the operating expenses,” the executive said. 
In the latest tender issued for hiring six jack-up rigs in Category 1 and three in Category 2, ONGC received offers for 14 rigs in Category 1 of which 9 were built between 1974 and 1983 and in Category 2, it received three old rigs, all built in the 1980s. The tender is under process.
ONGC could not be reached for comment."

 Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Tripura Asset would soon start extracting natural gas from Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary in Belonia subdivision of Gomati district following National Wildlife Board’s clearance of its proposal.
“We have discovered 10-12 gas bearing wells long back in Trishna Wildlife sanctuary. As the gas bearing zones are in the wildlife sanctuary, we needed permission from the National Wildlife Board. The National Wildlife Board, following recommendations from the state Wildlife Board, has cleared the project on Thursday,” Gautam Kumar Singha Roy, Asset Manager of ONGC Tripura Asset told reporters here.
He said that after the state Wildlife Board sanctioned the project on September 17, the state government had taken up the issue with National Wildlife Board.
He said ONGC has begun laying the pipeline and the entire process would be completed shortly.
The gas extracted from Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary would be transported to the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO) owned 100 MW gas-based thermal power project at Monarchak in Sonamura subdivision of Sipahijala district.
The official said that the ONGC Tripura Asset has completed the exploration target for 2018-19 three months ahead of schedule.
“Our exploration target of 19 wells was completed by December itself and six more wells would be explored in the remaining three months of the current financial year,” Singha Roy said adding that ONGC has augmented 10 lakh standard cubic metres gas this year compared to the last year, which was a record.
Singha Roy said that 50 per cent geographical area of the state still remains to be explored and it would be a great achievement if gas is discovered in even 10 per cent area.
He said the Tripura unit of ONGC would provide Rs 25 crore to the state government for carrying out Swacch Bharat Abhiyan."

17,2019-01-21,ONGC,"A Rs 250-crore oil drilling rig sold for Rs. 9 crore
Oil drilling rig ‘Badrinath’ — owned by bankrupt fleet owner GOL Offshore Ltd — has been sold for scrap by an admiralty court in Mumbai for ₹9.01 crore in a case that demonstrates the pitfalls associated with disposal of vessels during liquidation of shipping firms.
The current market value of the rig, which has been a workhorse for State-run oil explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) for close to 30 years, is about ₹250 crore.
Badrinath, a floater drilling rig, was auctioned on January 16 to scrap dealer PVR Enterprises, fetching a fraction of some ₹200 crore that GOL Offshore owed Punjab National Bank.
GOL is in the process of being liquidated and its assets are being sold one by one to pay off lenders.
The sale of ‘Badrinath’ shows the desperation of lenders to sell assets even at scrap value.
PC Kapoor and Vijay Kumar, the erstwhile promoters of shipbuilding firm Bharati Defence and Infrastructure Ltd, held a 49.73 per cent stake in GOL.
On January 14, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) ordered the liquidation of Bharati Defence.
The rig is considered one of its kind operating in India because of its stature as a “smallest floater” that can drill in any water depths. ONGC has patronised this rig for 30 years, hiring it on back-to-back contracts. The rig was to start on a three-year contract beginning October 15, 2016 with ONGC at a day rate of $60,000 (some $65 million or ₹473 crore over three years), prior to which it underwent a major overhaul. The rig was involved in many key oil and gas discoveries of the State-run oil exploration company.
“With this earning capacity, the rig can be a game changer. But, it has been sold for a ridiculous price of ₹9.01 crore. It is clear that brokers and buyers have formed a cartel to drive down the price,” a person briefed on the case said, asking not to be named.
Due to the winding-up petitions filed by lenders in courts, the rig could not start work on the ONGC contract and has been idling since February 2016. “The ONGC contract would have helped GOL Offshore come out of financial stress and lenders would have recovered all the money,” he said.
ONGC allowed a time extension of as much as nine months to the rig to start work on the three-year contact, underlining its demand and value to the oil explorer.
“Because of lack of knowledge on how the shipping industry functions, banks have lost all money by not operating the rig. Besides, an asset that could have been run for many more years has been sold as scrap,” he said.
The court-monitored auction did not factor in the value of the rig for trading purposes. “The valuation of only scrap sale was done. The valuation of rig in trading mode was left out,” he said questioning the rationale behind this."

Blocks relinquished earlier by ONGC and OIL are offered in the bid rounds




Blocks relinquished earlier by ONGC and OIL are offered in the bid rounds




The Centre has signed contracts with winners of blocks awarded under the Discovered Small Fields (DSF) Bid Round-II.
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has bagged five blocks, while Oil India Limited (OIL) has cornered two blocks in this round. 
A joint venture of IndianOil Corporation Limited (IOCL) and Hindustan Oil Exploration Company (HOEC) has won one block.
The remaining 15 blocks are private sector awardees, with Ganges Geo Resources Private Limited cornering the lion’s share with five blocks. Vedanta Limited, Arch Softwares Private Limited, Shanti G.D. Ispat and Power Private Limited and Bagadiya Brothers Private Limited have got two blocks each.
Speaking at the event, Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, said, “Fifteen companies have been provided with E&P contracts, interestingly eight among these are new entries in the sector… Our government has changed its priority from revenue-centric governance to production-centric. Increased local production means lower energy import bills, which, in turn, means more resources to commit towards developmental issues.”
The bid submission process in this round was completed on January 30, 2019.
The bidding started on August 9, 2018 with 25 contract areas on offer covering 59 discovered oil and gas fields. These fields are spread over 3,000 sq km with prospective resource base of over 190 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas.
Under DSF Bid Round-II, a total of 145 bids were received in 24 Contract Areas, an official statement said."

The NDA government was unsuccessful in privatising a state-run firm during the five-year rule despite a penchant for it fearing political backlash. But they have sowed the seeds for a relatively trouble-free sale later on with the help of strategic divestment involving public sector undertaking (PSU) to PSU deals.
Selling one PSU to another, contrary to perception, will alter the character and status of the PSU sold, said government sources. For instance, Dredging Corporation of India (DCI), in which the Centre sold its 74.47 per cent stake to four major port trusts for Rs 1,049 crore, is no longer a central public sector enterprise (CPSE) and hence will not be subjected to the guidelines framed by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE).
Visakhapatnam Port Trust, Paradip Port Trust, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and Deendayal Port Trust are together barred from selling DCI shares for three years beginning March 8, 2019, according to a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) signed between the Centre and the four major port trusts on that day.
The four port trusts, the new owners of DCI, are also not allowed to retrench employees of DCI for one-year beginning March 8.
Such lock-in periods for the sale of shares and retrenchment clauses have been prescribed in the case of the ONGC-HPCL deal as well as those involving NBCC-HSCC and PFC-REC. It will be stipulated in all such future transactions also.
But, nothing prevents ONGC, NBCC, PFC and the major port trusts from selling their stakes in HPCL, HSCC, REC and DCI after the lock-in period ends. That is mainly their call, though these entities are controlled by the Centre who can still call the shots in such sales.
But, a political dispensation with an inclination towards privatisation, is unlikely to block such sales, particularly when it has invented a smart way to boost the disinvestment kitty by asking cash-rich PSUs to buy some among their fraternity without incurring the wrath of the opposition political parties and workers unions.
The recent decision by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to tag IDBI Bank as a private lender bear this out. Unlike the above deals, LIC did not sign a share purchase agreement with the Centre while acquiring a controlling stake of 51 per cent in IDBI Bank because the government did not sell its shares to the state-run insurer.
LIC, in fact, bailed out IDBI Bank by subscribing to fresh shares issued by the financially stressed lender and through market purchases. In the process, LIC had to secure a special dispensation from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) because insurers are by law not allowed to hold more than 15 per cent stake in a bank.
RBI’s decision to label IDBI as a private lender came much before LIC pared its holding in the Bank to 15 per cent, drawing the ire of the employees and unions.
The DCI stake sale is a peculiar case. The Government sold its holding in DCI to four autonomous bodies that are functioning as trusts which are not bound by the DPE guidelines. Because, the seed capital for setting up these port trusts were given as grant by the Government and not as shares. This explains why the port trusts don’t pay any dividend to the Government.
“After the Government of India sold its shares in DCI to the four major port trusts, DCI has ceased to be a CPSE; that’s the whole idea behind strategic disinvestment,” said a top bureaucrat. “DCI will be managed by its board comprising nominees from the four port trusts who will decide its rules and regulations as per the Companies Act,” he said asking not to be named.
With its new owner not a PSU in the strict sense of the word, DCI has also lost its PSU and mini ratna status. This is not the case, though, with the other deals because ONGC, NBCC and PFC are owned by the government and hence HPCL, HSCC and REC will continue to be subjected to DPE norms.
Yet, their vulnerability to privatisation has increased, government sources added."

SBI (₹349.45)
SBI fell about 3 per cent in the initial part of the week. However, the stock managed to claw-back from the low of ₹333.75, recovering all the loss and closed 1.6 per cent higher for the week. An immediate resistance is at ₹352 for the stock which can be tested in the near future. A strong rise past this hurdle will take the stock higher to the next crucial resistance level of ₹362. 










As mentioned last week, SBI has to breach ₹362 decisively to gain fresh bullish momentum and target ₹390 and ₹400. But a pull-back from ₹362 can drag SBI lower to ₹350 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹335 and ₹362 for some more time. On the other hand, if SBI fails to surpass the immediate resistance level of ₹352, it can fall to ₹335 again. In that case, SBI can trade between ₹335 and ₹352 for some time. The stock will come under pressure if it declines below ₹335 levels. Such a break can take the stock lower to ₹325-320. The region around ₹320 is a strong long-term support and a further fall below it is unlikely.
 
ITC (₹274.2)
ITC continued to trade lower and has declined below ₹275 as expected. The stock was down 1.3 per cent last week. The outlook is bearish. Strong resistance is in the ₹280-282 region, which has been capping the upside over the last few weeks. Intermediate support is at ₹272.5. If this support holds, a range-bound move between ₹272.5 and ₹282 is possible for some time. 










However, the bias will continue to remain negative as the indicators on the charts are negative. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 100-day moving average as expected. This indicates that the downtrend is intact and the upside could be limited. An eventual break below ₹272.5 will bring renewed pressure on the stock. Such a break below will increase the likelihood of it tumbling towards ₹265 and ₹260. The levels of ₹262 and ₹257 are crucial long-term supports. The current downtrend is likely to find a bottom around these levels. A strong bounce from these supports will mark the beginning of a long-term uptrend in this stock.
 
Infosys (₹750.7)
Infosys has been stuck inbetween its support at ₹735 and resistance at ₹759 over the last couple of weeks. Within this range, the stock fell to ₹735 and bounced sharply from there to close 1.4 per cent higher last week. The 21-week moving average support level of ₹735 has held very well as expected and keeps the bullish view intact. 
 










The immediate resistance level of ₹759 is likely to be tested in the near term. The bias on the chart is positive. The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 55-day moving average. This is a bullish signal, which indicates that Infosys is likely to breach ₹759 and rise to ₹770 and ₹775 again. Inability to break above ₹775 can drag the stock lower to ₹755 and ₹750 again. Such a pull-back move will keep the broader ₹695-775 sideways range intact. The stock has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time since mid-January this year. On the other hand, if Infosys manages to surpass ₹775 decisively, it will gain fresh momentum and target ₹795 and ₹800 thereafter.
 
RIL (₹1,279.2)
As expected, RIL declined below the psychological level of ₹1,300. The stock was down about 3 per cent last week and closed decisively below the 21-week moving average level of ₹1,309. The level of ₹1,300 will now act as a strong support-turned-resistance and cap the upside. As long as the stock trades below ₹1,300, the outlook will remain negative. RIL has to rise past ₹1,300 decisively to negate the bearish view and rise to ₹1,320 and ₹1,350 levels again. 










But such a strong up-move looks unlikely now. As such, a fall to ₹1,240 can be seen in the near term. If the RIL stock manages to bounce from ₹1,240, a relief rally to ₹1,300 is possible. But a break below ₹1,240 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹1,220 and ₹1,200. The region between ₹1,220 and ₹1,200 is a strong long-term support for the stock. A further fall below ₹1,200 looks unlikely as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at those levels. A strong bounce from ₹1,200 may indicate the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend for the stock.
 
Tata Steel (₹497.75)
Tata Steel tumbled over 7 per cent intraweek, but managed to bounce-back, recovering almost all the loss. The near-term outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹492 and resistance at ₹506. A breakout on either side of ₹492 or ₹506 will decide the direction of the next move. 










A break above ₹506 will ease the downside pressure. Such a break will take the stock higher to ₹515 and ₹520. The region around ₹520 is a crucial long-term resistance, which has to be breached decisively to turn the outlook bullish. A break above ₹520 can take Tata Steel up to ₹530. But if the stock breaks below ₹492, it can fall initially to ₹475. A further break below ₹475 will then increase the likelihood of the stock revisiting ₹465-460 levels. Tata Steel can trade in a wide range of ₹460-520 in the coming weeks. A breakout on either side of ₹460 or ₹520 will set the direction of the next move.

7,2019-07-17,ONGC,"CAG finds deficiencies in ONGC’s marine logistics operations
The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has red-flagged multiple operational lacuna in marine logistics operations of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC).
The CAG said ONGC had not planned for adequate number of Offshore Supply Vessels (OSVs), resulting in compromise of mandatory safety (standby) duty. Besides, ONGC’s decision to reduce OSVs instead of costlier Platform Supply Vessels (PSVs) increased the cost of marine logistics operations by ₹25.99 crore.
The CAG also pointed out deficiencies in awarding of new vessel construction contract to an inexperienced contractor solely on the basis of experience of the foreign technical collaborator.
This led to much delay and against scheduled delivery of 12 vessels by December 2011, the contractor could deliver only seven vessels by March 2018, the CAG said.
Among other things, the inordinate delay in finalising tender for hiring of tanker led the company to procure fuel through costlier alternative source leading to additional cost of ₹163.44 crore, the CAG said.
The auditor recommended introducing fixed scheduling of vessels and considering utilisation of Cargo Carrying Units, among other suggestions.
In another report, the CAG observed that the National Aluminium Company Ltd (Nalco) was unable to maintain the required stock level of bauxite at the refinery-end due to lower production of the same in the mines.
The CAG said the actual production of alumina hydrate from 2012-2013 to 2016-2017 was 96.31 lakh tonnes against the target of 107.35 lakh tonnes, resulting in shortfall of 11.04 lakh tonnes. The shortfall in production was primarily due to under-performance of mining and allied activities.
The CAG also observed that the capacity utilisation of Nalco’s smelter plant remained lower than the installed capacity primarily due to non-availability of adequate power from the captive power plant.
“Nalco was not able to develop the coal blocks allotted by Government of India for supply of coal to the captive power plant for generation of required power for smelter plant.
“There was shortfall in production of 4.93 lakh tonnes of aluminium in the smelter plant during the period from 2012-2013 to 2016-2017 for want of required power. As a result, Nalco lost the opportunity of earning incremental contribution amounting to ₹1,086.63 crore during the above period,” the CAG said."
6,2019-08-09,ONGC,"ONGC hires six oil drilling jack-up rigs 
 
State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) last week hired six oil drilling jack-up rigs– two each from Shelf Drilling and Foresight Group International and one each from Greatship India and Jindal Drilling & Industries– on a three year contract. 
Greatdrill Chaaru, a 350 ft jack-up drill owned by Greatship (India) Ltd, a wholly owned unit of Great Eastern Shipping Company, was awarded the three-year contract, at an operating day rate of $46,322.
The 350 ft jack-up rigs Vivekanand 1 and Vivekanand 2, owned by Ravi Mehrotra-led Foresight Group International, won the contracts at operating day rates of $46,371 and $46,345, respectively, an ONGC official said.
Shelf Drilling, the world’s largest contractor of jack-up rigs, won contracts for its 300 ft jack-up rigs –F G McClintock and C E Thornton– at operating day rates of $42,458 and $42,402 respectively.
Virtue 1, the 350 ft jack-up rig owned by Jindal Drilling & Industries, part of the D P Jindal Group- was awarded the three-year contract at an operating day rate of $44,662.
Since 2014, ONGC has adopted the Quality, Cost, Based Selection (QCBS) for hiring oil drills rigs, a formula that gives 25 per cent weightage to technical and 75 per cent to commercial aspects.
The new rules focussed more on the commercial aspects to reap the benefits of a global over supply of rigs to secure much lower rates. It helped global rig owners to offer their older rigs of over 35 years at lower rates compared to new rigs. 
Drilling industry sources said that the operating day rates on the latest contracts of ONGC were higher than the $25,000-26,000 levels finalised last year. “Globally, the operating day rates for jack-up rigs have gone up to as much as $68,000,” said an industry official."

Following the fire that claimed four lives at ONGC’s oil and gas processing plant at Uran near Navi Mumbai on Tuesday, Maharashtra Power Generation Company Ltd (Mahagenco) is procuring gas from GAIL. Gas supply to Mahagenco’s 672 MW power plant was hit.
However, supply to ONGC’s other consumers such as Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL) has been fully restored. MGL supplies piped cooking gas to residential consumers and CNG for automobile fuel in Mumbai region.
A team from the ONGC top management is visiting the gas processing facility for damage assessment.
Mahagenco, a State-owned utility operates the gas-based power plant, located about 6 km away from ONGC’s facility, has four units of 108 MW and two units of 120 MW.
A senior Mahagenco official told BusinessLine that due to lower power demand in Maharashtra, the gas-based plant was producing about 256 MW of electricity on Tuesday. But due to the explosion at the ONGC facility, the management decided to shut down the plant. The gas supply has not resumed as of Wednesday, the official said.
A message from the Corporate Communication department of Mahagenco said that there was no threat to the power plant due to the explosion. Alternative arrangements are being made to procure gas from GAIL.
An ONGC press statement said that on Tuesday morning at about 6.47 am a strong hydrocarbon smell was reported at the Demineralised Water Plant (Oily Water Sewage Pit) and CISF security cabin, which is outside the main processing area. Plant personnel rushed to the site but a major fire incident occurred at 6.55 am.
Three CISF fire control personnel and a General Manager of ONGC succumbed to injuries in the fire. The blaze was brought under control by 8.55 am. Unprocessed gas being pumped from Bombay High oilfield was diverted to ONGC’s Hazira Plant. Efforts were made to meet full requirement of MGL, the statement said.
The fire and explosions at the plant created an atmosphere of fear in the villages surrounding the plant. About 5,000 people had to be temporarily relocated due to the fire.
ONGC tweeted that it is supplying 2 million metric standard cubic metre per day of Gas to MGL against the average daily requirement of 1.8 - 1.9 mmscmd. As such there’s no short supply. Steps have been taken keep ensure that supply to MGL remains uninterrupted so that citizens of Mumbai are not affected."
4,2019-09-23,ONGC,"Corporate tax cuts: Stocks that gain the most
Earnings growth for India Inc, which has been on first gear in recent times, is all set to receive a boost from lower tax outgo, with the reduced corporate tax rates. For many manufacturing companies, the savings on this front could give them room to reduce prices or improve other spends, thereby spurring demand. Many companies in sectors such as infrastructure, capital goods and FMCG stand to gain. Some others in the auto, steel, oil and gas, and real-estate segments could also get a leg-up. IT companies may be better off under the current regime though, given the lower tax incidence at present.
Most companies in the information technology space will not be enthused by the corporate tax rate cuts announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. There are two reasons. Many companies have an effective corporate tax rate below 25.17 per cent (including surcharge and cess) and they get the benefit of profit-based deductions for exporting their services from special economic zones in India.
Also, IT and software companies that build their own intellectual property get a weighted deduction under the income-tax laws on the R&D expenses that they have incurred to build their IP.
Now, such companies might have to pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) calculated on their book profits.
The Finance Minister has slashed MAT from 18.5 per cent to 15 per cent. That puts the effective tax rate, including surcharge, for companies paying MAT at 17.5 per cent compared with 21.6 per cent earlier.
This means that IT companies that get tax deductions on their export revenues earned from operating in SEZs, and pay MAT, wouldn’t want to opt out of claiming these deductions. They would also have to forego the weighted deduction on R&D that brings down the effective corporate tax rate.
Besides, if they opt for the lower effective corporate tax rate of 25.2 per cent, they will have to take a one-time charge of any MAT credit that might be in their books.
In 2018-19, out of the top-tier IT companies in the S&P BSE IT Index, only Infosys (26 per cent) had an effective tax rate of over 25 per cent at the standalone level, while TCS (21.3 per cent), HCL Technologies (23.7 per cent), Wipro (23.02 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (19.6 per cent) had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
Even most mid-tier IT companies such as Mphasis (20.5 per cent), Hexaware (22.3 per cent), Mindtree (24.9 per cent), L&T Infotech (21.7 per cent) and L&T Technology Services (24.2 per cent), had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
In all, IT companies won’t be rushing to opt out of their export-based tax incentives until the benefit of paying lower taxes on export revenues runs out.
With major players such as Hindustan Unilever, Nestle, Britannia, GSK Consumer and Colgate-Palmolive suffering an effective tax of 32-36 per cent, the FMCG segment could be a beneficiary of the new 25.17 per cent tax rate.
At the same time, home-grown companies such as Dabur, Jyothy Labs, Godrej Consumer, Bajaj Consumer and Marico may not choose to move to the new regime, considering that their effective tax rates are either on a par with or lower than 25.17 per cent.
Overall, for shareholders in FMCG stocks, this move could result in the 2018-19 profits of listed FMCG players, on an aggregate, inching up by 9 per cent.
However, FMCG companies can choose to retain a portion of the benefits to increase advertising spends and/or pass it on as price cuts to boost demand. In the quarter-ended June 2019, for instance, major FMCG companies clocked single-digit growth in sales due to poor volumes.
Going by the 2018-19 numbers, Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motors and Maruti Suzuki and Eicher Motors have an effective tax rate of 29-33 per cent and could benefit from the reduced rates. However, the rates of Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland, are much lower. Taking M&M ‘s reported tax expenses (standalone) for 2018-19, the effective tax rate is only at 24.17 per cent (21.3 per cent, considering the current year's tax expense alone).
The company also has a MAT credit of ₹1,116.35 crore in its books as on March 31, 2019. Ashok Leyland’s effective tax rate, given the reported tax expense for 2018-19, is 20.6 per cent (15.14 per cent taking the current year's expense alone). The company has availed itself of benefit to the extent of ₹233 crore on tax concessions and tax holidays in 2018-19 and has MAT credit on its books.
In such cases, companies may choose to continue under the current regime till the tax holiday/concessions exist. Since MAT also continues at a reduced rate of 15 per cent, these companies can choose to pay tax as per normal rates or as per MAT, whichever is higher — as has been the case until now. MAT credit can also be set off against the tax liability in future years.
Among auto ancillaries, MNC players such as SKF India, Goodyear and Bosch that have high effective tax rates of 33-36 per cent could be major beneficiaries. Put together, listed companies in the auto and auto ancillaries space may see a 3-5 per cent addition to their profits of 2018-19, if they choose to avail themselves of the 25.17 per cent tax rate.
For infrastructure companies, the effective tax rates in FY19, after taking into account all eligible exemptions and tax holidays, work out to 27-35 per cent of their standalone PBT. For companies such as Engineers India, Ircon International, Ashoka Buildcon and RITES, availing themselves of the lower tax rate of 25.17 per cent could translate to a 14-18 per cent jump in earnings, going forward. Whereas, giants such as Larsen & Toubro and IRB Infra developers could witness only a 2 and 5 per cent rise in PAT led by tax savings.
Among the pure construction players, NCC, Welspun and Sadhbav Engg could benefit. Certain companies have effective tax rates of less than 25 per cent, which can be on account of payment of minimum alternate tax, or availing themselves of benefits of differential depreciation on fixed assets under the IT Act. The effects of the amendments announced will hence have to be evaluated on a case-to-case basis.
For instance, Dilip Buildcon has an effective tax rate of 16 per cent in FY19 on account of MAT provisions (inferred from the annual report). Hence, the lowered MAT rates could bring down its effective tax rate further, and the company would also get the existing MAT credit entitlement.
On the other hand, Adani Port and SEZ now enjoy an effective tax rate of 21 per cent, after availing itself of deductions under Section 80IAB of the Income Tax Act for 10 years, with effect from FY07-08. This apart, it has several subsidiaries and joint ventures that can get tax holiday benefits under Section 80IA.
The company is also likely to benefit from the grandfathering of taxes on buyback, as the management had made a public announcement of the share buyback of ₹1,960 crore on June 4, 2019.
Among the cement manufacturers, the effective tax rate in FY19 for most companies (on a standalone basis) is less than 25 per cent — they may refrain from foregoing their exemptions and deductions. This includes large players like Ultratech and Shree Cement. However, there could be savings in PAT in the range of 11-15 per cent for Himadri, Deccan and India Cements if they opt for the subsidised rates, as their current effective tax rate is more than 25.17 per cent.
The impact of the lower corporate tax on the steel industry is expected to be mixed, at least in the near future.
The tax incidence on companies such as Tata Steel, Kalyani Steels and Jindal Stainless Hisar in FY19 was 39 per cent, 33 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively. Note that these are the tax rates after taking into account the tax exemptions that the companies are eligible for. Thus, these companies stand to gain in a big way if they opt for the reduced tax rate of 22 per cent (25.17 per cent including surcharge and cess).
Companies such as JSW Steel and Tata Metaliks with effective tax rates of 20 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, may not opt for the reduced tax rate immediately. Meanwhile, SAIL, Jindal Steel and Uttam Galva had zero current tax for FY19. This could be either due to companies making losses in FY19 or accumulated losses from previous years, setting off the year’s profits. If the new reduced tax rate is opted, setting-off of losses will not be possible, making it unattractive. However, in the long run, when the companies turn profitable or become eligible to pay MAT, they can opt for the new tax rates, which could reduce their tax outgo.
The move to reduce corporate tax seems largely positive for real-estate companies reeling under pressure due to tight liquidity in the market. For most realty companies, the effective tax rate is higher than 25.17 per cent (including cess and surcharge), based on standalone profit before tax. For instance, for Oberoi Realty and Ashiana Housing, the current tax rate is 29 per cent, while for Kolte-Patil, it works out to around 45 per cent.
These companies, if they adopt the new corporate tax regime, could improve their earnings, even if they forego their exemptions and MAT credit.
If players pass on the benefit to home buyers, it could spur demand in the market.
But for companies such as Sunteck Realty and Prestige Estate Properties, for which the effective current year tax rates work out to less than 5 per cent, and Brigade Enterprises and Sobha with 23 per cent rate, continuing with the existing tax structure may be better.
For the oil and gas sector, the cut in corporate tax rate seems largely positive. Going by their FY19 standalone financials, the effective tax rate for most companies in the sector is higher than the 25.17 per cent rate (including surcharge and cess) that will apply to them now. For instance, in FY19, the current tax provision of city gas distributors Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas was about 31 per cent of their profit before tax.
The effective tax rate for the PSU hydrocarbon explorers, ONGC and Oil India, and gas transmitter GAIL (India) was 27-28 per cent, while it was about 29 per cent for PSU refiner HPCL. The highest tax rate — about 32 per cent — was borne by Gujarat-based gas transmitter GSPL. For the above companies, the new tax rate of 22 per cent plus surcharge of 10 per cent and cess of 4 per cent — totalling 25.17 per cent — should translate into lower tax outgo. Even if these companies have to give up some investment-based tax exemptions and credit of minimum alternate tax carried forward from earlier years, they should be better off under the new tax rate regime.
On the other hand, there are a few companies such as Reliance Industries, PSU refiners Indian Oil and BPCL, and gas importer Petronet LNG that may not benefit from the new tax rate. In FY19, the current tax provision of Reliance Industries, Indian Oil and BPCL was about 20 per cent of their profit before tax — this is lower than the new effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
It is the same case for Petronet LNG, which had an effective tax rate of about 24 per cent last year. For these companies, it may be worthwhile continuing with their existing tax structure, taking the benefits, if any, of investment-based tax exemptions, and carried forward MAT credit and carried forward loss.
In the case of Reliance Industries, for instance, while the applicable tax rate in FY19 was 34.94 per cent, it was able to reduce the effective rate (excluding deferred tax adjustments) to about 20 per cent, thanks to exempted income, and additional allowances net of MAT credit.
The company may likely find it more beneficial to continue with this arrangement until the tax breaks that keep the effective tax low are exhausted.
Later, it could shift to the new regime with the effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman opened the liquidity tap for corporates on Friday by announcing a sharp tax cut and leaving more money in their hands for capacity expansion. The statutory tax rate for corporates has been lowered to 22 per cent from 30 per cent. This benefit, though, is only for companies that wish to give up their tax exemptions. Given that most tax incentives and exemptions have been phased out over the past few years, companies may prefer to forego the few they enjoy now, and opt to be taxed at the lower rate of 22 per cent.
New manufacturing companies incorporated after October 1, 2019, can benefit from an even lower rate of 15 per cent tax if they don’t claim the tax benefits they are eligible for. India Inc will also get relief on MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax). The Finance Minister has reduced MAT to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent. This would benefit companies located in SEZ developers, infrastructure, cement companies, companies with units in specified locations in the North-East and exporters. There is also relief on buyback tax.
The 20 per cent tax on buybacks by corporates, which was announced in the Budget on July 5, 2019, would not apply to companies that announced them before the Budget day. According to data from nseinfobase.com, companies, including Sasken Technologies, Greaves Cotton, Welspun Corp, Star Cement and Eris Lifesciences, whose issues are on the way, but were announced before July 5, and for companies such as Infosys, which had buybacks ongoing in July, will benefit from the change. Wipro is also set to benefit as it announced its buyback on June 5.
Companies that pay corporate taxes under the new rates of 15 and 22 per cent will be charged a flat surcharge of 10 per cent, irrespective of their taxable income. The companies that choose the existing regime, availing exemptions and deductions, will have to pay a surcharge only if their total income exceeds ₹1 crore. The rates of surcharge for them will continue to be at 7 per cent and 12 per cent, for total income between ₹1 crore and ₹10 crore and more than ₹10 crore, respectively.
The stock market on Friday cheered the Finance Minister’s move to cut taxes. While companies that are currently paying lower rates due to various deductions and exemptions, such as many information technology players, are unlikely to shift to the new regime, there are many companies across sectors that are likely to see their tax incidence move lower, thus translating to higher profits. If the lower tax incidence is passed on to customers in the form of price cuts, it can help spur demand.
 








 
Ever since the late Finance Minister Arun Jaitley kick-started the process of a phased reduction in corporate tax in 2016-17 and elimination of exemptions, the effective tax rate for India Inc has only gone up.
This is because, while smaller companies were given the benefit of a lower tax rate each year, the phasing out of some tax deductions began impacting the tax outgo of larger companies.
Further, in 2015-16, the Finance Minister also increased the surcharge on corporate tax. That year, for companies with income of up to ₹10 crore, the surcharge was increased to 7 per cent from 5 per cent, and for firms with income above ₹10 crore, it was increased to 12 per cent from 10 per cent. Thus, the effective tax rate in 2017-18 came to 29.49 per cent; it was 23.22 per cent in 2013-14. This increase — evident in the numbers of the past one year — was due to larger companies coughing up more.
In 2017-18, the effective tax rate for companies making profit of more than ₹500 crore was 26.3 per cent; in 2016-17, it was 23.94 per cent. The effective tax rate for smaller companies making profit of ₹1-10 crore came down to 27.38 per cent from 29.2 per cent. So far, withdrawal of tax exemptions has made the effective tax rate of larger companies move higher. It is from here on that these companies will start benefiting.
Now, all companies that are willing to give up their tax incentives can pay taxes at a fairly lower rate of 22 per cent.
 
India is now among the countries that have a low corporate tax rate, and can compete better globally. For the current year, KPMG data show that the statutory tax rate in Myanmar is 25 per cent; in Malaysia, it is 24 per cent; 25 per cent in Indonesia and Korea and 28 per cent in Sri Lanka. Even Chinese companies cough up more — as they pay a tax of 25 per cent — and in Brazil, it is 34 per cent.
The global average corporate tax rate is 23.79 now, and the Asian average is 21.09 per cent. That said, the current move to cut taxes is going to make a hole in the government’s tax kitty. Last year, as per the Budget estimates, the revenue foregone by the Centre on various tax incentives was ₹1.08-lakh crore. Now, with tax cuts, there will be an additional revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore.
 
Bond investors who have been basking in the double-digit return glory over the past year may be in for a bumpy ride ahead. While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s corporate tax rate cut has cheered India Inc and the equity market, the move is a dampener for bond markets.
This is because the revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore owing to the cut will throw the Centre’s fiscal deficit target off track. The RBI’s surplus transfer to the Centre, at best, makes up for the existing shortfall in income tax and GST collections. While higher proceeds from disinvestment and some tax buoyancy (towards the end of the fiscal), on account of the growth-boosting measures, can aid revenues, for now, the ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue loss appears to have left a big hole in the Centre’s kitty. The fiscal deficit target could well move up to 4 per cent (from the projected 3.3 per cent), implying additional borrowings.
Based on the Controller General of Accounts’ (CGA) provisional figures for FY19 (in which income tax grew by a modest 7 per cent), the estimated growth in income tax collections for FY20 works out to 23 per cent. For April-July, CGA data suggest that the growth in net income tax was just about 6 per cent. There is also a significant shortfall in GST collections.
The surplus transfer by the RBI as recommended by the Bimal Jalan Committee has offered a much-needed respite to the Centre in the current fiscal. Excluding the ₹28,000-crore interim dividend already paid by the RBI to the Centre last fiscal, the net transfer in the current financial year amounts to ₹1,48,051 crore. But while optically, the surplus transfer appears to be a massive figure, essentially, it is about ₹60,000 crore above what was estimated in the Budget. Hence, this additional bonanza can help make good the shortfall in tax revenues.
On the disinvestment front, the Centre has set a target of ₹1.05-lakh crore (above the ₹85,000 crore achieved the previous year), which may be achievable. But given that the Centre has been missing its target on spectrum, it is unlikely to meet its estimate of ₹50,500 crore for FY20.
On balance, before the corporate tax rate cut, the Centre could have still pulled off the 3.3 per cent (risk of missing GDP growth assumptions though remained). The substantial ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue foregone on account of the corporate tax rate cut is an additional burden for the Centre that can take its fiscal deficit target to 4 per cent levels.
The joker in the pack is still the underlying growth in the economy. While the real GDP growth has fallen from 8 per cent last year to 5 per cent this fiscal in the April-June quarter, the sharp fall in nominal GDP growth from 12.6 per cent to 8 per cent during this period is worrisome.
The Centre’s fiscal deficit target assumes a 11 per cent growth in nominal GDP growth for FY20 (from the Central Statistics Office’s FY19 estimates), which is a tall task. If growth falters further, the fiscal deficit target can even move beyond 4 per cent levels.
The biggest overhang for Indian bond markets has been the huge gross market borrowings by the Centre pegged at a high ₹7.1-lakh crore in the current fiscal (from ₹5.71-lakh crore last year). But given that the borrowing calendar has been front-loaded, the market was factoring in the easing of supply of bonds in the second half of the fiscal.
For the April-September 2019 period, issuance of government securities amounts to ₹4.42-lakh crore; the balance ₹2.68-lakh crore of gross borrowings will come in the second half. But the supply of bonds in the second half could go up now. The stimulus announced by the Centre would lead to additional borrowings, which implies more supply of bonds and higher yields (bond prices and yields are inversely related).
Going ahead with the foreign sovereign bond issuance could be a saving grace. The ₹70,000-odd crore of foreign sovereign bonds pegged in by most economists can help lower bond yields in the domestic market.
Even though the RBI cut its policy repo rate by a notable 35 basis points in its August policy, Indian bond yields have only inched up. From 6.3 per cent levels in the beginning of August, the yield on 10-year government bonds has increased to 6.6 per cent levels, already factoring in expectations of a fiscal stimulus from the Centre. Post the FM’s move on corporate tax rate, the yield has moved up by another 20 basis points.
Given that expectations of fiscal slippage has been factored into bond yields to some extent, bond yields could remain range-bound in the near term, until there is more clarity on foreign sovereign bond issuance, GST collections and the disinvestment agenda. Expectations of the RBI cutting rates further, given the sanguine inflation trends, may also cap the upside in bond yields. That said, notable rise in yields cannot be ruled out in the coming months, given the significant slip on fiscal deficit and volatile rupee.
Given the uncertainty around various factors impacting bond yields, investors must cap their expectations and tread with caution. Long-term gilt funds as a category has delivered 15-16 per cent returns over the past year, thanks to the sharp rise in bond prices. A rise in yield (fall in prices) hereon can impact returns.
Hence, investors should avoid duration and credit risk in their portfolio. A chunk of your debt fund investments should be in short-term debt funds that carry less volatility in returns. Short- and medium-duration debt funds having a duration of up to 3-4 years are ideal for investors with medium risk appetite. Opt for corporate bond funds that invest a chunk of their assets in high-rated debt instruments."
3,2019-09-30,ONGC,"Domestic gas price cut by 12.5 per cent to $3.23 a unit 
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has lowered the price of domestically produced natural gas to $ 3.23 per million British thermal unit (mBtu). This price will be applicable from October 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.  The new price is 12.5 per cent lower than the $ 3.69 mBtu natural gas price for the April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019 period. 
The ceiling price allowed for gas to be produced from difficult fields has also been lowered to $ 8.43 a mBtu from $ 9.32 a mBtu. Domestic natural gas price in the country is governed as per the New Domestic Gas policy, 2014. 
Commenting on the impact of this cut, a CARE Ratings statement said, “As per our estimates, a 12.5 per cent fall in natural gas prices could potentially lead to a 6 per cent decrease in cost of production of urea, thus decreasing the working capital intensity of the fertiliser manufacturers and also acting as a relief for the fiscal spending of the government while disbursing the urea subsidy.” 
CARE Ratings also said that a lowered gas price could deter investments in domestic production. The ratings agency said, “Upstream oil and gas exploration companies will not benefit with the decrease in gas prices as it will lead to low earnings due to decline in per unit realisations in the natural gas segment. This could potentially discourage upstream companies to take up domestic gas exploration.”"

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan. - Kamal Narang


 Amid reports of ONGC’s inability to derive any benefit out of its HPCL acquisition, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said the state-owned firm was free to sell its stake in the oil refining and marketing company.
 In its most expensive acquisition ever, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) last year paid Rs 36,915 crore to buy government’s entire 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL). Despite being the majority stakeholder in the company, ONGC has only got one member on the board and virtually no say in the management. 
 HPCL did not even recognise ONGC as its promoter for almost one-and-half-years before a Securities and Exchange Board of India rap forced it to list its majority owner as a promoter. Since acquiring the stake, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm’s board. 
 HPCL head Mukesh K Surana continues with the title of Chairman and Managing Director despite corporate governance structure mandate of only one chairman in a group and subsidiaries being headed by managing directors or chief executive officers (CEOs).
 When asked if the government had given ONGC nod to sell stake in HPCL, Pradhan told reporters that “These are market decisions. They are autonomous companies. They are free to take their own decision at appropriate time.” ONGC had hoped that the addition of an oil refining and marketing company would make it a vertically integrated oil and gas company when it had acquired government stake in HPCL in January last year. 
 However, no tangible synergies have flowed to the company. The acquisition turned ONGC from a zero-debt company to a firm with no cash and a huge debt pile. Sources said, since the government had repealed the acts that nationalised HPCL and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), ONGC is now free to sell the stake. The board of ONGC has on at least one occasion debated on the logic of retaining the stake in HPCL when no synergies were flowing, they said."

The long-term outlook for Oil and Natural Gas Corporation remains negative. File Photo
   -  Reuters


The long-term outlook for Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (Rs 128.3) remains negative. However, in the short-term, it may remain positive. The stock has major support at Rs 117 and a close below that level alone can change the short-term outlook to negative. On the other hand, it finds an immediate resistance at Rs 132 and a major one at Rs 144. A close above the latter could also change the medium-term outlook to positive. Only a close above Rs 180 would change the long-term outlook to positive for ONGC. 
Having breached several resistance levels, ONGC may move sideways, before charting a rally.
F&O pointers: The ONGC January futures at Rs 127.80 rules at a discount to the spot price, indicating the existence of short positions. Options trading indicates a range of Rs 125-130 for the scrip.
Strategy: Traders could consider going long on ONGC futures, with an initial stop-loss at Rs 117. If the contract opens at Rs 127 on Monday and sustains above that level in the first half, then shift the stop-loss to Rs 125 and trail it with the rally. Traders could aim for a target of Rs 132 and Rs 144.
Traders should remember that this strategy will involve higher margin commitments and could result in heavy loss. So, it is only for traders who can withstand high swings and have deep pockets to meet margin commitments.
Alternatively, traders could consider buying Rs 127.50-call, that closed with a premium of Rs 4.10. As the market lot is 4100, this would cost traders Rs 17,015. Exit the position if the option premium rises to Rs 7 or falls to Rs 1.80.
Follow-up: Hold ITC positions."
