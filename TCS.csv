 Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) today said it has opened North America Insurance hub for business operations in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
The move, part of a multi-year deal between TCS and Transamerica announced in January this year, will transform the administration of Transferal’s US insurance and annuity business lines, TCS said in a statement.
It will also accelerate the enhancement of Transamerica’s digital capabilities and modernise its platforms to service all lines of its business customers, the statement added.
“Iowa is proud to welcome the TCS North America Insurance hub to Cedar Rapids. This move is a positive one, not only for the local business environment, but also for our state’s leadership on the national stage in the insurance industry,” Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said.
As part of the over USD 2 billion deal, TCS will now administer Transamerica’s life insurance, annuity, supplemental health insurance, and workplace voluntary benefits products, and manage the administration of more than 10 million policies.
The Mumbai-based company also plans to expand its ‘goIT’ and ‘Ignite My Future in School’ programmes into Cedar Rapids in 2018 and beyond to engage with students and teachers to pursue computer science education and digital skills.

Tata Consultancy Services will declare results for Q4 and full-year ended March 2018 on Thursday. Though Infosys posted results on expected lines, its shares fell close to 4 per cent since the results, as the company lowered its margin guidance to 22-24 per cent for FY19 from 23-25 per cent in FY18. Most analysts expect TCS’ results to be better than Infosys. Analysts also expect the largest market-cap company to announce a margin guidance of over 25 per cent."
144,2018-04-19,TCS,"In Q4, TCS outperforms Infy across parameters
K Venkatasubramanian TCS has yet again outpaced Infosys across parameters, with the March quarter results widening the gulf between the two IT giants.
Of course, Infosys is just finding its feet again with a new CEO and is expected to stabilise soon. But, if the trends in the growth trajectory of the two blue chip companies sustain, TCS will clearly continue to command a large valuation premium over Infosys.
In a seasonally weak quarter, TCS beat market expectations and delivered much better revenue and profit growth figures. Margins and metrics such as attrition too were better for TCS.
TCS delivered a 3.9 per cent sequential increase in revenues for the fourth quarter of FY18, while Infosys managed just 1.8 per cent. 
TCS witnessed a 2 per cent increase in volumes (person months billed), indicating client traction even in a traditionally weak quarter for the industry. Infosys managed a 1.1 per cent increase in volumes.
TCS added one client in the $100-million category and three in the $50-million bucket during the quarter.
Leading the pack
The Tata Group firm reported an operating margin of 25.4 per cent in the March quarter, which was a percentage point more than what Infosys managed. Though the difference does not seem large, it does become significant when considering the fact that TCS has a 75 per cent larger revenue base.
Attrition too was under control for TCS, at 11 per cent, compared to Infosys’ 19.5 per cent.
In terms of digital offerings though, Infosys (25.5 per cent of revenues) has done better than TCS (21.2 per cent).
TCS does not give guidance, but its CEO has said that the company is ‘committed to double-digit growth’, while Infosys has guided for a 7-9 per cent increase in revenues this year. 
Sign of revival
For the industry, it may be an early sign of revival, as the two leading lights may deliver at the upper end of trade body Nasscom’s projected growth rate of 7-9 per cent in FY19.
The TCS stock will command a premium, given its superior performance. The trailing 12 months price-earnings multiple for TCS is 24 times, while Infosys trades at 16 times, according to Bloomberg."

Jefferies says management commentary of strong growth in retail in FY19 and green shoots in Banking Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) support its view of an acceleration in growth going forward.
Commentary on BFSI was more tempered though it did indicate some green shoots in the key North American market which has been key to the sluggish growth in the sector, it says.
IDBI Capital says “more confident of TCS seeing the best improvement in FY19 revenue growth (organic) amongst IT large-caps”.

Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and Managing Director of TCS.


 TCS is betting big on its ‘Business 4.0’ strategy to propel its revenues from new age-technologies like automation, cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) to over USD 5 billion this year.
 Speaking to PTI, TCS CEO and Managing Director Rajesh Gopinathan said Business 4.0 is thought leadership framework to help customers leverage digital technologies to address their growth and transformation agendas. 
“There are many components to digital technologies, there is cloud, automation, analytics, IoT. People have been looking at various technologies, each of which is powerful and valuable in its own right but the point has been how do you stitch it together to help businesses,” he said.
 He added that Business 4.0 provides an integrated and holistic framework to help customers address issues and focus on growth in an agile manner.
 Gopinathan said the “digital opportunity” globally runs in the billions as these new technologies are becoming increasingly entrenched across the table at an enterprise.
 “Last year, we had crossed $ 3 billion (in digital revenue)...It has grown 35 per cent, it has grown faster than it had grown last year. We have crossed $ 4 billion in digital revenues... Run rate-wise, it is close to $ 4.7 billion,” Gopinathan said.
TCS Chief Operating Officer N Ganapathy Subramaniam said Business 4.0 has worked for the company and that the strategy has the potential to drive large-scale transformation across sectors like retail, travel and hospitality, utilities etc.
 He added that there has been a steady increase in the number and size of digital assignments clients are providing. 
In FY2018, over 2.45 lakh TCS employees were trained on digital, and more than 2 lakh employees have now been trained at various stages of ‘Agile’ methodologies."
145,2018-04-23,TCS,"Continental Europe, UK fuel growth for TCS
TCS, which reported a 4.5 per cent growth in its consolidated net profit in Q4, saw certain verticals growing in double digits YoY. Growth was led by the Energy & Utilities vertical, which grew 33.7 per cent in the quarter, followed by Travel & Hospitality, which registered a 25.4 per cent growth.
In terms of markets, Continental Europe and UK turned out to be big growth contributors in the fourth quarter.
MD and CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said that increased demand in the region coupled with the company’s ability to package different digital solutions together helped TCS capture new projects in the region. Overall, Continental Europe grew 19.1 per cent, UK grew 10.7 per cent, while the Asia-Pacific market registered a 8.6 per cent growth for the IT services firm. North America, the biggest market for TCS, grew by 4.9% YoY.
Operating margins at 25.4 per cent fell into TCS’ stated targeted band of 25-27 per cent. However, for the full year, operating margins fell short of the target at 24.8 per cent.
“We’re glad to announce we’re back to double digit trajectory on dollar revenue growth, UK has been leading with a strong growth of over 10 per cent year-on-year,” said Gopinathan.
This helped TCS add three new customers in the above-$50 million category during the quarter.
Full-year profit dips
For FY18, TCS saw its net profit dipping 1.7 per cent to ₹25,826 crore, while revenue rose 4.3 per cent to ₹1,23,104 crore.
The IT services attrition rate for TCS fell by 0.1 per cent in the quarter to 11 per cent, while the total attrition rate (including BPS) fell to 11.8 per cent. TCS added 4,118 net new employees in the quarter.
“Post 4QFY18 performance, we are encouraged by renewed traction in TCS’ business,” said Harit Shah, Analyst (IT), Reliance Securities. “Apart from BFSI and retail, other verticals achieved results either in line with or better than the company average growth. The company also issued a bonus of 1:1 which, along with the share buyback, is likely to improve sentiment. Given these factors, we believe the stock will be able to command a higher multiple.”"

Shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) today surged over 4 per cent, following which the IT major became the first listed Indian company to hit a market capitalisation of over $100 billion (Rs 6,80,912.10 crore).
After opening the session at Rs 3,429, the stock jumped 4.39 per cent to touch an intra-day high of Rs 3,557 on the BSE. Following the uptick in the counter, the market capitalisation of the company swelled to Rs 6,80,912.10 crore.

At the end of Friday’s trading session the the IT major commanded a m-cap, which was Rs 7,917.08 crore, just short of the $100-billion milestone at Rs 6,52,082.92 crore. The stock was the biggest gainer on both benchmark indices -- BSE and NSE.
The country’s largest software exporter had on April 19 reported a 4.4 per cent rise in March quarter net profit at Rs 6,904 crore.

“With robust deal wins and green-shoots in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector, there is a definite possibility of double-digit revenue growth. With growth acceleration, scale-up in digital and support from currency, margins are ready for uptick as well, implying return of double-digit revenue/earnings growth after 3 years,” Edelweiss Research said in a note.
TCS also announced a 1:1 bonus of shares and a dividend of Rs 29 a share, taking the total payout to shareholders at Rs 50 for the year. It has given out close to Rs 26,000 crore to the shareholders via dividend and bonus."
139,2018-04-23,TCS,"Adapting to change
An unexpectedly strong performance by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in the fourth quarter of FY18 has secured a $100-billion market capitalisation for the company and pushed up the BSE IT index. For a market inured to disappointments from the IT majors in the last couple of years, their recent numbers have come as a pleasant surprise. TCS’ strong sequential growth rates — 3.8 per cent in revenues, 5.7 per cent in net profits — and its improving business mix enthused investors. Infosys, while delivering lower growth, beat expectations on deal wins and traction in new businesses. Management commentary from both IT firms has been unusually optimistic too, with the TCS CEO ‘committed to double-digit growth’ and Infosys guiding for a 7-9 per cent expansion.
As the IT industry’s growth rate spiralled down from 15-20 per cent to about 7 per cent in FY16, it attracted considerable criticism for clinging to archaic business models. Indian players were perceived as one-trick ponies over-reliant on just one geography (North America, 60 per cent of revenues) and one vertical (BFSI, 40 per cent). As automation made rapid inroads and protectionism reared its head, traditional services such as application development and maintenance, and software testing, which thrived mainly on labour cost arbitrage, hit a wall too. But the significant business transformation that the IT majors have wrought in just a year, shows that the dire prognoses about their survival were over-blown. Riding the tailwinds of global recovery, these firms have managed to expand their European footprints (25 per cent of revenues). With new deal wins in utilities, life sciences, manufacturing and retail, the BFSI vertical (33 per cent of revenues) is no longer the sole bread-winner. Digital offerings have made rapid strides, chipping in with a fourth of the service mix in the latest quarter. Embracing automation, they have pruned wage bills by hiking utilisation rates, re-skilling the workforce and drastically reducing new hires. TCS and Infosys made net additions of just 7,775 and 3,743 employees to their mammoth workforce of 3.9 lakh and 2 lakh respectively in FY18.
True, building on this transformation entails challenges and not all domestic players will be up to it. Bruising competition in the new areas is likely to pressure profit margins and force more on-site hiring. Nor does all this imply that the industry can get back to the 15-20 per cent growth rates it saw during its heydays. For a maturing industry with a revenue base of $150 billion plus, even a 10 per cent growth would be an achievement. But while the fittest in the industry may yet survive, it is India’s policymakers who now have to scrounge around for new ideas to deliver on white-collar employment and services exports, two critical components of the India growth story."

TCS, which listed on August 25, 2004, had a stellar debut, claiming a 27 per cent premium to its issue price of ₹850. Even at listing, the company was worth over $10 billion, with revenues of over $1 billion.
Rebasing the listing price to adjust for two bonus issues, in July 2006 and June 2009, each in the ratio of 1:1, the stock has given returns of around 1,260 per cent in about 14 years.
 








 
After posting staggering fourth-quarter results on Thursday, TCS made history, with its market-cap soaring to ₹6,79,332 crore in intra-day trade on Monday before closing at ₹6,53,767 crore.
“It is a very proud moment for all of us,” Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran said in a statement. “TCS has been able to create value consistently by making the right investments, not only in terms of technology, but also in terms of creating capabilities, building leadership and talent, seeding new markets and developing scalable world-class solutions. I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support.”

“For such a large firm in a maturing industry to be able to maintain and even enhance profitability over so many years, and to be able to deliver well above industry revenue growth, is no mean feat.

Taking four lakh people back to the classroom isn’t an easy task, even for a cash-rich company like Tata Consultancy Services, the $100-billion (market cap) IT services company.
Is it easier for TCS to hire skilled workforce from the outside? Not really. The skills required are not to be found. So, TCS embarked on its reskilling journey a few years ago, where it decided to train its entire workforce. More than 2,40,000 have already been trained.
In the Mysuru campus of Infosys, trainees have to go through a six-month training programme which includes studying of three programming languages, instead of one earlier. Additionally, courses on analytics and cloud computing are taught. According to Infosys COO UB Pravin Rao, the company is looking to replicate this training model in the US.
“Unless we make sure our people have the technical capabilities, we will not be able to serve our customers. Moreover, it isn’t viable to rehire and let go of existing people,” Ajoy Mukherjee, Chief HR Officer at TCS, told BusinessLine. However, the unanswered issue is the extent to which the industry will sustain investments in reskilling at a time of shrinking margins. According to Mukherjee, even if it were possible to hire enough talent from outside, it would be hard to replicate customer relationships, organisation-fit and the industry knowledge base that existing employees have.
Capgemini is taking a ‘going back to basics’ approach to retrain its workforce. “Compared to what is traditionally done, digital services (or the gamut of new skills needed) create a very different skill requirement as well as different ways of working,” says Ashwin Yardi, COO-India, Capgemini.








 
 
Tackling cost
Companies also provide training through internal online portals and mobile apps that make it easier to train at low cost.
“We track the competency of individuals at 4 levels — E0 to E3. Based on that, we expose them to the new technology. With four lakh people, classroom training for everyone is not possible and learning has to use digital technologies. Our virtual classrooms offer gamified learning. From this platform, you should be able to log into a server where you can solve problems by actually developing code on newer technologies,” says Mukherjee.
IBM has created a massive open online course platform for its one-lakh odd employees in India. “It has broken down learning into byte size. Most people have day jobs, so time becomes an issue. So with byte size modules, they can learn at their pace,” says Chaitanya N Sreenivas, Vice-President & HR Head, at IBM India/South Asia.
Companies such as TCS are open to hiring professionals with any educational background, provided they’ve spent time in new technology areas. Google, Amazon and IBM often don’t stress academic credentials either; proficiency in coding, and in areas where skills are in short supply, holds the key."

Under the lens According to the Committee, The Home Office and TCS now accept that the contract for modernisation was signed in 2012 without anyone having a clear understanding of what it would take


 A modernisation programme by Britain’s Home Office being undertaken by Tata Consultancy Services has come under fire with a British Parliamentary Committee terming it as a “masterclass in incompetence.”
According to a report by the Committee, published on May 25, “The modernisation of Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) is currently over four years late and £229 million over its original budget, with no agreed date for completion. In 2012, the Home Office planned that the first stage of modernisation would be completed by March 2014 but it is still not complete four years later.”
“The programme was delayed from the start requiring the contract between DBS and its previous supplier, Capita, to be extended by two years because of delays transitioning the service to DBS’ current supplier, TCS. The safeguarding service offered by DBS remains paper-based and, one year before the contract with TCS is due to end, much of the modernisation programme still has to be delivered, and costs are expected to be £229 million more than initially planned,” stated the report by the UK’s House of Commons Public Accounts Committee. 
When contacted TCS spokesperson said, “TCS and DBS are discussing the recommendations made by the PAC and will incorporate these, as appropriate and feasible, in the remainder of the modernisation plan.”
 The report further said that DBS and TCS are now locked in negotiations about where the fault for these delays lie. “Both DBS and TCS claim that modernisation can be delivered before the TCS contract ends in March 2019 but, at the time of our evidence session, neither could offer any details of how or when this might happen.”
Modernisation programme
According to the Committee, The Home Office and TCS now accept that the contract for modernisation was signed in 2012 without anyone having a clear understanding of what it would take to make the programme successful. 
“TCS did not think it was its job to offer any advice that might have helped the Home Office run the programme better, and adopted an old-fashioned ‘big-bang’ approach rather than splitting the task into smaller, manageable, pieces from the outset.”
The UK’s Home Office helps safeguard children and vulnerable adults by providing employers with a service that lets them see safeguarding information, such as details of criminal records, about people who want to work with children or vulnerable adults. 
Employers use this service to help them decide who to employ. The safeguarding service is run by the DBS, an arm’s length body set up by the Home Office in 2012."

India’s largest IT services firm, TCS, in collaboration with Intel Corporation, is setting up a Centre for Advanced Computing to develop solutions in the areas of High Performance Computing (HPC), High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA), and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
The new centre, at TCS’ Super Computing facility in Pune, will be enabled by integrating the latest Intel Xeon Scalable processors with Intel Omni-Path Fabric (Intel OP Fabric), Intel Optane technology, BigDL and additional Intel technologies in the future. 
The centre will focus on enabling TCS specialists leverage the most advanced HPC, HPDA, and AI technologies to create industry-specific solutions across life-sciences, genomics, manufacturing, technology, retail, utilities, banking, and insurance sectors, as well as testing and research in areas that include weather forecasting and disaster monitoring.
V Rajanna, Vice-President and Global Head, Technology Business Unit, TCS, said: “HPC capabilities are critical for enterprises to become ‘Business 4.0’ prepared. TCS and Intel are on the forefront helping customers re-imagine their products and services through high performing research that will transform the product experience for the end user.”
“Convergence efforts are being focussed on combining HPC and ‘big data’ analytics workload together using a unified HPC system. This engagement enables the capability to bring advanced analytical tools to scientists, which can enable extreme data processing capabilities, some of which are complementary to analysing large HPC simulations,” said Lisa Davis, Vice-President in the Intel Datacenter Group and GM, Digital Transformation & Scale Solutions Group. 
Solutions developed at the Centre for Advanced Computing will be leveraged for real world applications to address complex computing needs for research initiatives in life sciences, where simulations and molecular structural modelling are becoming increasingly common, and in the finance industry where risk and asset management rely on large computational data analysis. 
In addition, the centre will enable multiple Centres of Excellence within TCS focussed on digital technologies and HPC/HPDA, TCS said in a statement.

 Re-skilling of employees has had a positive impact on the operating margins of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).
According to Ajoyendra Mukherjee, Executive Vice-President, Global Head - Human Resources, TCS, cost and subsequent (adverse) impact on margins would have been more if the company had the go in for outside hiring.
“Yes, we have made sufficient investments towards (tech) re-skilling programmes over the last few years. I think, margins would have been lower had we gone for outside hiring,” he told BusinessLine during a visit to the company’s Kolkata campus. 
Mukherjee, though, could not quantify the actual impact on margins.
Through programmes under digital transformation and ‘agile’, the IT major has trained over two lakh of its 394,998 workforce. Not a single employee has been retrenched so far by TCS, he claimed. 
For the Indian IT industry, newer avenues like automation have come in as a threat to lower-level jobs. The solution, sources say, is to upgrade skills.
Operating margins 
For FY18, the company reported an operating margin – a measure of its profitability – of 24.8 per cent (25.7 per cent in FY-17). While on a year-on-year basis, margins dipped, sequentially (between Q2 FY-17 and Q4 FY-18), there has been an improvement.
Mukherjee pointed out that currency fluctuations have been one of the primary reasons for the drop.
“A major part of margin reduction is because of currency fluctuations. We can hedge against a few currencies only. Moreover, any benefit that has arisen out of currency hedging has been put back for re-skilling programmes,” he said. Sequentially, margins improved from 23.4 per cent in the April to June period of FY18. It went up to 25.1 per cent in the July-Sept quarter and to 25.2 per cent for October-December and to 25.4 per cent in January-March.
Local hires in the US
Incidentally, the company has brought down the number of H-1B applications to nearly half of what it was three years back. Locally hiring in the US, Mukherjee said, is sometimes a cost-effective option.
The move comes at a time when the Indian IT companies are confronted by closer scrutiny and tighter visa norms in the US, a market that accounts for nearly 60 per cent of India's IT exports. 
Mukherjee categorically claimed that there was a “dearth of talent” in the US with fewer youths opting for “STEM” subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
“We have significantly ramped up (local hiring), replicating some programmes that have worked well for us in India such as partnering academic institutions and engaging with high school students,” Mukherjee said without mentioning the hiring target in the US. In India, the company has issued job offers to 20,000 trainees in FY-19. Net employee addition stood at around 8,000 in FY18, the lowest in recent times."

India’s largest software exporter TCS said it has expanded its agreement with insurer M&G Prudential, which will expand the deal size to more than $1.2 billion. 
The 10-year partnership, which was announced in January 2018, aimed to digitally transform M&G Prudential’s business and deliver an enhanced service for its UK savings and retirement customers and was worth $690 million. 
“The agreement has now been expanded to cover an additional 1.8 million customer policies which will move from M&G Prudential to TCS, bringing the total number of policies covered by the partnership to 5.8 million, and is worth an additional £500 million ($668 million) over the term of the contract,” TCS said in a statement. 
Nearly 400 employees in the UK and 183 employees in India will be moved from the insurer to TCS. 
Clare Bousfield, Chief Executive, Prudential UK, said: “We are confident that extending our strategic partnership is the right thing to do. Our customers will benefit from a better experience, digitally enhanced systems, tools and service, while the colleagues who have been central to our success in servicing our customers will join a rapidly growing business and have access to many opportunities that being part of a world leading IT services company can deliver.” Suresh Muthuswami, President and Global Head, Banking, Financial Services and Insurance Platform, TCS, said: “Earlier this year, we embarked on a journey to digitally transform and provide an enhanced service for M&G Prudential customers.

126,2018-06-13,TCS,"TCS to consider buyback of shares on June 15 
 India’s largest software services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will consider a buyback proposal at its board meeting to be held later this week.
“...the board of directors will consider a proposal for buyback of equity shares of the company, at its meeting to be held on June 15, 2018,” TCS had said in a BSE filing late last night.
The Mumbai-based company, however, did not disclose any further details about the buyback proposal. During its Q4 FY2018 earnings call, TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan had said the company’s intention is “to keep capital return close to 80-100 per cent of annual free cash flow’’.
Last year, TCS had undertaken a Rs 16,000-crore mega buyback offer, entailing 5.61 crore shares at Rs 2,850 per equity share. The buyback process had seen Tata Sons tendering over 3.60 crore shares, accounting for 64.2 per cent of the total shares bought back by the company. 
Other large investors, who participated in the buyback, were Government of Singapore, Copthall Mauritius Investments Ltd and EuroPacific Growth Fund.
During FY2018, TCS had returned Rs 26,800 crore to shareholders throught dividend and buyback. For the full year, TCS’ net cash from operations amounted to Rs 28,160 crore and free cash flow stood at Rs 26,360 crore.
Share buybacks typically improve the earnings per share and return surplus cash to shareholders, while also supporting share prices during sluggish market conditions.
Indian IT companies have been under pressure to return excess cash on their books to shareholders through generous dividends and buybacks. Many IT firms, including Infosys (Rs 13,000 crore) and HCL Technologies (Rs 3,500 crore) had undertaken buyback schemes last year."
125,2018-06-14,TCS,"TCS could buy back shares worth over ₹10,000 crore
India’s largest software exporter TCS’ board of directors will meet on Friday to consider a proposal to buy back shares. Industry expects the buyback will be at least ₹10,000 crore.
“..the Board of Directors will consider a proposal for buyback of equity shares of the Company, at its meeting to be held on June 15, 2018,” TCS said in a stock exchange filing.
While TCS did not disclose any further details about the buyback including the number of shares that it plans to repurchase and at what price, industry watchers expect the buyback to come at a similar level as its last year’s mega buyback.
During its fourth quarter earnings call, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said the company’s intention is to keep capital return close to 80-100 per cent of annual free cash flow. Last year, TCS announced a ₹16,000-crore mega share buyback at ₹2,850 apiece that closed on May 31. Infosys similarly repurchased shared worth ₹10,000 crore, while Wipro bought back ₹11,000 crore worth of its stock.
“Last year, TCS had bought back 5.6 crore equity shares, representing around 2.85 per cent of its total equity for around ₹16,000 crore, which was around 118 per cent of its FCF. We also expect Infosys to come out with a buyback programme sometime in this year,” Sharekhan said in a note.
“For FY19, we have factored a total payout of ₹23,900 crore, in-line with TCS’s outlook for a payout of 80-100 per cent of FCF,” Urmil Shah, Research Analyst at IDBI Capital, said. “We see a high probability of the quantum of buyback in this year being at least at the same level as in FY18 or ₹16,000 crore. If the buyback is done at ₹1,800 (near to CMP of ₹1,781), TCS would be able to buy back 2.32 per cent of its outstanding shares,” he said."

While Tata Consultancy Services received a respite from trade secret lawsuit filed against it in the US last year trimming its payout by more than half, the company still expects fines to go up, as per its annual report.
“In September 2017, the Company received a Court order reducing the damages from ₹6,114 crore ($940 million) to ₹2,732 crore ($420 million) to Epic. The Company has received legal advice to the effect that the order and the reduced damages awarded are not supported by evidence presented during the trial and a strong appeal can be made to superior Court to fully set aside the Order,” TCS said in its annual report. 
In 2016, US grand jury order slapped two Tata group companies — Tata Consultancy Services and Tata America International Corp — with a $940-million fine in a trade secret lawsuit filed against them by Epic. The companies were accused of “brazenly stealing trade secrets, confidential information, documents and data” belonging to Epic. The fine was later reduced to $420 million in September last year. TCS, however, continues to contest charges.
TCS said a Letter of Credit has been made available to Epic for ₹2,862 crore ($440 million) as financial security in order to stay execution of the judgement pending post-judgement proceedings and appeal. “Accordingly, an amount of ₹2,862 crore ($440 million) is disclosed as contingent liability as included in the claims not acknowledged as debts by the Company.”
The question about the provision was raised during TCS’ annual general meeting, where at least two shareholders brought it, asking not only why the provision is made but also whether the company has invested as to who was responsible for this information stealing.
“Can you explain why the company is issuing a letter of credit of $440 million to EPIC even though the fine was reduced to $420 million?” asked TCS shareholder Tamal Majumdar. 
“Who is responsible for this? What action has TCS taken against this person,” asked another investor questioning the management over the EPIC case. 
TCS Chairman N Chandrasekaran did not respond on the query about the action taken against the people responsible but pointed out that since the case is still in the court, “we have to wait”."

 India’s largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services on Monday opened its new delivery centre in Suresnes, France. 
The delivery centre, which is located in the Parisian region, can accommodate up to 230 employees, TCS said in a statement.
Along with TCS’ existing locations in Lille and Poitiers, the new delivery centre highlights the company’s growing focus on the region as IT services firms look beyond US to grow their revenues. Europe is one of the fastest-growing regions for TCS. 
Rammohan Gourneni, TCS France Country Head, said, “The region stands at an incredibly exciting point in technological history, and as Europe’s third largest IT services market we are perfectly placed to ensure TCS’ innovative solutions can help French businesses grow and transform in the Business 4.0 era. ” The launch of “Paris DC” follows the French government’s huge investment into digital technology, with President Emmanuel Macron recently outlining his strategy to invest €1.5 billion into AI over the next four years.
“As TCS celebrates 50 years of operations and 25 years of presence in France, the opening of this delivery centre marks a new step in our development in this strategic market,” said Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and Managing Director, TCS.
Since establishing operations in France in 1992, TCS has gone from strength to strength in the region. 
In 2006, TCS acquired its then representative and exclusive partner in France, TKS. The acquisition laid the foundation for TCS’ long-term strategic growth into Europe’s third largest IT services market, and was followed by the opening of a first delivery centre in Lille in 2012, the acquisition of Alti in 2013, and the opening of second delivery centre in 2014 in Poitiers. 
In two years, TCS doubled the number of employees at this centre.
Over the past five years, TCS’ growth in France has been strengthened by the development of the business sector, and the signing of major contracts with French multi-national customers. 
For example, TCS and BNP Paribas Securities Services partnered to build a solution for the asset servicing sector with TCS’ blockchain Quartz technology."

In a seasonally strong June quarter, TCS has exceeded market expectations on its financials and operational parameters. Growth was broad-based across key segments and the company also managed to drive digital revenues at a strong pace. Addition of large-size clients has also been healthy.
During the period, the company’s revenues grew by 1.6 per cent in dollar terms (4.1 per cent in constant currency) sequentially. Net profits expanded by 1.1 per cent. The operating margin continued to be robust, at 25 per cent.
 








 
 
Broad-based growth
All verticals grew for TCS during the June quarter. Key segments such as BFSI (banking financial services and insurance), retail & CPG, life sciences & healthcare and energy & utilities grew at 3.6-5.2 per cent sequentially in constant currency.
Revenues from key geographies, including the Americas(north and south) and Europe increased at a healthy pace.
The growth across verticals and geographies suggests that there has been broad-based client traction for TCS.
In an environment where large deals are hard to come by, the company has managed to add two customers in the $100 million category and five in the $10 million bucket.
TCS’ digital focus also came to the fore during the quarter. The company derives 25 per cent of its revenues from digital offerings. The increase in digital revenues has been a scorching 44.8 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal compared to the same period last year.
Attrition was reasonable at 10.9 per cent. TCS seems to have justified the huge premium that it commands vis-à-vis peers such as Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technology in the markets.
The company has made the most of a seasonally strong June period and delivered a healthy 10 per cent growth in dollar terms on a YoY basis.
It appears well on course to beat the upper end of trade body Nasscom’s revenue growth projection for the industry of 7-9 per cent in FY19.
For domestic software services players, these numbers kindle hope for a double-digit revenue growth after a couple of fairly weak years for the industry."

 IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has posted a 23.7 per cent increase in consolidated net profit for the first quarter at ₹7,362 crore, buoyed by overall growth and a revival in the BFSI segment. The company was also helped by a rise in operating income and other income.
TCS had posted a net profit of ₹5,950 crore in the year-ago period.
During the reporting quarter, the total income of the Tata group’s flagship company rose 16.18 per cent to ₹35,486 crore (₹30,543 crore). “We are starting the new fiscal year on a strong note, with the growth engine firing on all cylinders. Our banking vertical recovered very nicely this quarter, while other industry verticals maintained their momentum. With a good set of wins during the quarter, a robust deal pipeline and accelerating digital demand, we are positioned well for the future,” said Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and Managing Director, TCS.
On a constant-currency basis, the company’s banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical grew 4.1 per cent. North America, led by the US, which is the company’s largest operational and income geography, grew 7 per cent from the year-ago quarter. The company’s digital revenue rose 44.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis, now providing 25 per cent of the revenue mix.
“On a larger scale, I would say TCS needs to improve the digital share of its revenue which has been growing fast. I am benchmarking this with MNCs such as IBM, where 50 per cent of their revenue comes from digital sources,” said DD Mishra, Research Director at Gartner.
The company added two new clients in the $100-million band and 13 clients in the $5-million band during the quarter. TCS’ total employee strength stood at 4,00,875, while IT services attrition stood at 10.9 per cent (last 12 months).
“It has been an excellent quarter, with broad-based growth across all segments and good client additions. We are seeing strong demand in areas like cloud transformation, cyber-security and data privacy, and automation. Our investments in forward-thinking doctrines like the Machine First Delivery Model (MFDM) and Location-independent Agile are giving customers immediate, measurable business benefits and speed to market,” said N Ganapathy Subramaniam, TCS’ Chief Operating Officer & Executive Director. 
TCS shares closed 0.56 per cent up at ₹1,877 on a steady BSE, which ended up 0.85 per cent on Tuesday. “We believe the strong quarterly performance would support the current valuations of the company and further upside would largely be function of outlook on BFSI clients that may lead to earnings upgrade. In the previous quarter, the company said this will take a couple of quarters for recovery; any optimism here can be a crucial determinant,” said analysts at Emkay Global."

109,2018-07-17,TCS,"Big IT companies are no longer high on job-seekers’ list
Once the dream workplaces of software engineers, companies such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra do not feature in the top 10 list for job-seekers.
According to a survey by LinkedIn, new-age companies such as Directi, Flipkart, Paytm and Oyo are favoured by job-seekers in India. LinkedIn has collated this data from a cross-section of industries, jobs and skills that people have searched for on its platform.
Apart from the new-age companies, multinationals such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Anheuser-Busch InBev, KPMG and Ernst & Young complete the top 10 list. Interestingly, not a single Indian software exporter, which was instrumental in building the $167-billion IT industry figures in the top 10.
Industry watchers cite a lack of career growth opportunities, inability to work on projects involving the latest technologies and a regressive corporate culture as reasons that are putting off many job-seekers.
Role preferences
Mohan Lakhamraju, Founder and CEO, Great Learning, said this trend is a reflection of the roles that professionals prefer. While big IT companies have plenty of openings, they still have only a small percentage (of the total jobs) involved in cutting-edge tech, he said. Currently, the top 3 together employ around 8 lakh.
“For technologies like Java, or roles like application maintenance or software testing, people prefer to go to software exporters. On the other hand, for roles such as Data Scientists or Artificial Intelligence (AI), they flock to new-age companies,” said Amandeep Kaur, Founder, Phoenix TalentX Branding, an employer branding company. Others share Peter Drucker’s saying that culture eats strategy for breakfast.
Culture matters
According to Neha Bagaria, Founder and CEO, JobsForHer, an online portal that connects women looking to restart their careers, “Culture matters a lot, and these companies, given their size, have a hierarchy, and people get pigeon-holed in a job role.”
Additionally, new-age companies pay salaries that are at par with software exporters. Typically, entry-level employees get ₹15,000-20,000 per month. “Many a time, start-ups match these salaries and offer additional incentives such as stock options so they can have skin in the game,” added Bagaria.
This also reflects a change in the psyche of job-seekers: in the past, they were more fixated on a brand name, in addition to pressures from the family to work in a ‘stable’ company. Job-seekers are more open to failures, and the stigma associated with failures is fading away, said Kaur.
Some in the industry believe that there will be a mix of new age companies and mature organizations on a job seeker’s radar. While culture, work-life balance, social consciousness are some factors that have moved up the priority list, especially for the younger generation - brand and growth opportunities still remain high on the list for many, said Arjun Pratap, Founder and CEO, EdGE Networks."

Easing tax regulations, shifting focus from regulatory regime and digital technology are the key drivers for the TCS’ impressive performance in Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) sector, said K Krithivasan, BFSI group head, Tata Consultancy Services, here on Tuesday.
“There is a shift from compliance to growth mindset,” said Krithivasan, adding that regulatory and compliance pressures and internal focus on cost optimisation were hitherto taking banks’ focus from growth.
TCS recorded a net profit of ₹7,340 crore, at a growth rate of 6.3 per cent from previous quarter and a revenue growth of 6.8 per cent on quarterly basis to ₹34,261 crore with BFSI sector contributing around 40 per cent of the total revenue. The sector recorded a growth of 4.1 per cent on a yearly basis and 3.7 per cent for June quarter majorly from the North-American region.
“Over 2.7 lakh employees are digitally trained and we are in the process of training the rest of the employees,” said Ravi Viswanathan, Chief Marketing Officer, TCS.
TCS, which has 4 lakh employees, saw its digital revenue grew by 44.8 per cent on a yearly basis contributing up to 25 per cent of the total revenue.
“We took the position that we will invest in creating digital skills, which we call it organic growth strategy” Viswanathan said, adding that customers are seeing the results of ‘Business 4.0’, a thought leadership framework launched by TCS in the second quarter to leverage on digital technologies to help customers.
Commenting that Chennai has been the bedrock for all operations of TCS, Viswanathan said, “We have made investments in our Digital Labs in Chennai, Siruseri campus across all verticals like Banking, Retail etc.”
He also added that the company is recognised as one of the third largest brand in IT services and fastest growing brand valued over $10 billion.

107,2018-07-20,TCS,"All things equal, how did TCS hurtle past Infosys?
Retail shareholders in India generally sing paeans of their companies at AGMs. However, over the past three years, some Infosys shareholders have been persistently questioning the company’s continued lacklustre performance, drawing comparisons with TCS.
This year was not any different. Shareholders did question India’s second largest software exporter, asking why TCS is sprinting far ahead while Infosys is lagging.
The numbers tell a big part of the story. TCS started off FY19 on a strong note, with the June quarter earnings beating analysts’ expectations. Infosys, on the other hand, sputtered and performed just in line with analyst estimates.
What changed
In 2009, Infosys’ market capitalisation was 1.5 times bigger than TCS’. Less than a decade since, TCS (at $100 billion) is 2.6 times larger than Infosys ($41.72 billion).
So, all things being equal — the shifts in technology, old business getting redundant and strict curbs on US visas — how has TCS managed to stay ahead in the race?
“TCS has done the best job of understanding how to build and leverage organisational assets to compete. Customers around the world perceive and experience it as being a very strong company,” said Peter Schumacher, CEO at Value Leadership Group, an offshoring expert.
Breaking it down, TCS laid its bets on technologies like big data, AI and mobility for enterprises across all industries much ahead of Infosys, which has made some unconvincing attempts branching out (for example, the Panaya acquisition). “You have to see the storm before it comes and that is what good CEOs do,” said the CEO of a large multinational captive in India which does business with TCS.
Internal problems
The gap between TCS and Infosys was further accentuated due to internal problems plaguing the latter in the last four years — from a confusing shift in strategy to a public spat between the co-founders and former board members.
Contrast this with TCS, which, in the seven years under N Chandrasekaran leadership, turned into an industry bellwether. Its revenue grew almost four-fold, from ₹30,029 crore in FY10 to ₹117,966 crore in FY17, representing a CAGR of 21.6 per cent.
However, before comparing them, it is important to first note the fundamental cultural differences between the two organisations. TCS has always been a larger and more stable company with a stronger focus on governance enabled by a somewhat more conservative risk appetite.
“Over time it has innovated, taken calculated risks such as the major investments in global delivery centres made in South America, ventures in Japan and even some acquisitions (French IT services firm ALTI),” said Sanjoy Sen, Doctoral Research Scholar, Aston Business School.
It didn’t help that the technology industry itself has turned on its head, making the business model of bodyshopping increasingly inconsequential.
TCS, meanwhile, has continued its march over Infosys. Areas such as digital, where client spends are moving up, have raked in around ₹26,000 crore for TCS, against ₹18,000 crore for Infosys.
Leadership change
Even after Chandrasekaran, in an unexpected move, left TCS in early 2017 to take over the reins of Tata Sons, the company has continued to perform well, now under CEO Rajesh Gopinathan (refer table). “Now it is not about getting the work done at the lowest cost, but about hand-holding clients and telling them how their businesses can thrive,” said Rohit Turkhud, Partner, Fakhoury Global Immigration.
Based on Value Leadership’s recent discussions with leading CIOs in Europe, TCS is perceived as being the best firm by far. Infosys is playing in the second league and corporate decision makers expect it will continue to lag.
Collaborative culture
“They (TCS) have done the best job creating an open, collaborative, learning culture. In contrast to Infosys, customers recognise that TCS has a track record of transforming successfully and building organisational capabilities internally,” said Schumacher of Value Leadership.
Though the financial services sector is among TCS’ largest success stories, it has slowly but surely developed a wider and more balanced client portfolio. For instance, it has developed business in the aerospace and automotive sectors, and collaborates with sister companies like Tata Technologies.
Infosys probably started with a similar culture in its early days, albeit smaller in size and more hungry. However, multiple changes in leadership and related governance challenges, together with large-scale infusion of senior executives with a quick-win mindset, have impacted the company, said Sen of Aston Business School."

Tata Consultancy Services, Rolta India and the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) have placed initial bids for building and maintaining a re-designed Long-Range Identification and Tracking system (LRIT) for ships, for the government.
The main aim of LRIT is national and international search and rescue as well as security and environmental protection.
The LRIT regulation covers all passenger ships, including high-speed craft and cargo ships of 300 gross tonnage and above, and mobile offshore drilling units engaged in international and coastal voyages.
Any ship belonging to a flag State should transmit information regarding its identity, location, date and time of position to a country as soon as it enters the LRIT boundary (1,000 nautical miles) of that country’s coastal line.
The details should be provided at a default interval of six hours or at least four times a day till the ship leaves the LRIT boundary. Port countries, where a ship is likely to touch, have the right to track the ship any time during its voyage. A ship has to provide information on demand.
“TCS, Rolta and C-DAC have filed applications for the multi-million dollar project,” a government official briefed on the tender said.
The LRIT software currently tracks 650 Indian vessels and has some 300 users.
Expanding services
The Directorate General of Shipping (DGS) is planning to extend LRIT services to more countries such as Maldives, Mauritius, Bangladesh and Myanmar, which is expected to increase the user base accessing the system.
The redeveloped LRIT software will be designed to manage 10,000 ships in multiple countries, up from the existing 5000 vessels.
The new LRIT system seeks to develop an Indian National Data Centre (NDC) to identify and track Indian ships sailing across the globe and disseminate identification and positional information to entitled countries.
Besides, the DG Shipping, Navy and Coast Guard can easily track foreign-ship movements around the Indian coastal boundary, provide quick search and rescue, use LRIT to investigate hit-and-run cases, help in handling pirate incidents, as well as in protecting the marine environment.
LRIT has also been declared as a critical information infrastructure by the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre.
This necessitated a redevelopment of the LRIT system for which bids were called by the DGS.
Born after 9/11
LRIT was proposed by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, to track about 50,000 large ships around the world. The LRIT regulations, drafted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), came into force on January 1, 2008, and is binding on all members.
In India, the DGS collaborated with ISRO in early 2008 to develop an LRIT solution.
Antrix, the commercial wing of ISRO, sought support from IT industries, CMC and Tata Communications for its implementation.
The LRIT application designed by ISRO was developed in 2009 by CMC (under the guidance of ISRO). After CMC was acquired by TCS, the LRIT application has been under maintenance by the IT services company.
In 2016, the centre, through a gazette notification, declared the LRIT system, facilities, information, assets, logistics, infrastructure and dependencies installed at LRIT locations as protected under the Information Technology Act, 2000."
104,2018-08-09,TCS,"TCS in talks with other software majors to market its automation software
 
India’s largest software exporter TCS has begun working with external organisations to market its automation software Ignio.
When asked if TCS is willing to engage other services companies such as Infosys and Wipro to sell Ignio, Harrick Vin, Vice-President, TCS and Global Head, Digitate, told BusinessLine that the company is already in the process of doing so, although none of the partnerships have fructified yet.
“We already have 10 partners on board which includes Unisys, which has relationships with the US government. So far TCS does not work with the US government. Unisys will help us get that. We are also starting to engage with other large systems integrator like TCS to sell Ignio,” Vin said.
Growing revenues
After TCS launched Ignio, the company said that the division has crossed $31 million in revenues last year, making it one of the fastest growing companies in the segment, growing at 100 per cent year-on year since going live in 2015. About 86 percent of these revenues came from licensing while rest came from services.
The company has over 50 clients using Ignio, with an average contract value of about $550,000 per year.
“We want to become the fastest growing products company to reach $100 million in revenue, Vin added without giving any timelines. “Many of the customers we work with have never been TCS customers. Also, while most of them started on a small scale are taking Ignio to multiple departments within the enterprise.”
Ignio already has over 550 people working for it, including 300 scientists and researchers. Digitate has already filed for over 75 patents. The company said it will continue to invest in the brand and continue to hire.
“We are EBITDA positive. So we don’t have any issues of cash,” Vin said. “We will continue to invest in R&D as well as people.”
Digitate
Digitate is a unit within TCS which houses Ignio. TCS has consciously tried to disassociate itself from Digitate to ensure that Digitate is viewed as a products company and not a services unit within TCS.
“While we (Digitate) have no plans to be an independent company, we have a separate brand identity which we’d like to preserve. Ignio is only our first product. We are working on several other products that’ll come out over a period of time,” Vin said.
In terms of revenue, Ignio is still a small fraction of TCS’ overall digital revenues. But it presents a much bigger opportunity for the tech firm.
According to Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and MD, Tata Consultancy Services, at the time of inception of Ignio, five years ago, the company estimated its potential revenues at $2 billion. That was an estimate when the software was being built only for enterprise infrastructure services delivery. Since then it has expanded its scope to applications and business processes, increasing the overall growth opportunity for Ignio.
“Rapid breakthroughs in digital technologies — such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and automation — are reshaping businesses and fostering creative disruptions. The revenue and customer growth for ignio has been over 100% y-o-y. The success and growth of ignio reaffirms TCS’ Business 4.0 strategy, helping customers leverage technology to innovate and gain a competitive advantage,” said, Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and MD, Tata Consultancy Services.
Ignio competes with a host of automation companies such as BluePrism, AutomationAnywhere and IBM Watson."

  S Latha, a 23-year-old BTech graduate, took a two-year break after working for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). But now, when she has decided to return, she found that traditional IT jobs were not on offer. 
“My friends advised me to do a course in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), analytics or blockchain technology,” she says.
What surprised Latha’s father was the fee for the one-year course in AI/ML. “An IT training institute at Gachibowli said the course would cost ₹4 lakh, which is the amount Ispent for my BTech,” she adds.
With traditional skill-sets making it difficult to land jobs, both fresh graduates and seasoned professionals alike are approaching IT training institutes to acquire additional skills. 
But experts have a word of caution. “If the quality is good, one can pay such amounts for those courses. One needs to be very careful while choosing the course,” warns a professor at Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad.

 India has more bright people than any other country but it missed the opportunity to be a leader, said FC Kohli, the first CEO of the country’s top IT company Tata Consultancy Services who is known as the father of Indian software industry.
“India is a source of people who are very bright. How come, we are not on top of the world? Is it due to politicians or bureaucrats? Perhaps it is (both) but I don’t want to get in to this. I have nothing against bureaucrats or rulers. Nearly 15 years ago, at a meeting in the US, there was a topic on India has no business to be poor. I agreed,” he said in his speech on receiving Life Time Achievement Award at the CII Connect 2018, a two-day conference and exposition on ICT.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami presented the award to Kohli for his contribution to the software industry at the event’s valedictory function on Wednesday.
India has done well in software exports but not in computerisation within the country. Computerisation in this country was limited to English speaking population, which was not more than 100 million. What happened to the rest? “Even today, I cannot converse with computers in any of the Indian languages. We have developed software, but it is not adequate. We have 700 million people who do not speak English but have some education using computers,” Kohli said.
Almost 20 per cent companies in the US in the computer field are being run by Indians. How come? Everybody to be a successful person need not be abroad. They should also be in India,” he added.
“It is time that we consider computers a necessity rather than a luxury,” he said.
Palaniswami said the State government wants to take governance to the next level by using IT for which various ICT tools have been adopted. “Chennai is the Software as a Service (SaaS) Capital of India. We propose to give a huge impetus to this sector to make Tamil Nadu a global destination,” he said.
Tamil Nadu IT minister M Manikandan said the State is likely to sign MoUs worth ₹15,000 crore in the the IT-ITeS sector in the forthcoming Global Investors Meet to be held early next year. 
CII Connect 2018 chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan said that a FinTech Centre of Excellence will be set up in Chennai. The State government should also consider CoEs in new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence for use in auto and entertainment industries.
Palaniswami replied that he would consider the suggestions made in the event. Natarajan said Connect 2019 will be held in September next year."
98,2018-10-10,TCS,"All eyes on TCS’ Q2 financial performance
 
Thursday is the big day for the Q2 results season. Tata Consultancy Services will announce its quarterly financial performance for the period ended September 2018. Most analysts expect the EBIT margin of the company to improve in the second quarter of FY19 on account of rupee depreciation. Analysts expect sequential growth of about 4 per cent in revenues from the IT major. GM Breweries and specialty chemicals firm Amal will also declare their quarterly results."
97,2018-10-11,TCS,"TCS posts 22.6% rise in Q2 profit; shares sunny outlook for FY19 
India’s largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported a 22.6 per cent rise in its net profit for the quarter ended September 30 to ₹7,901 crore, largely backed by the rupee depreciation and improved business sentiment.
TCS’ second-quarter revenue rose 20.7 per cent YoY basis to ₹36,854 crore. In dollar terms, revenues rose 11.5 per cent to $5,215 million from the year-ago period. This is the first time in eight consecutive quarters that TCS has reported double-digit growth in revenues in constant currency terms.
“This has been a landmark quarter for us,” said MD and CEO Rajesh Gopinathan. “For two years, we have been on a journey to return to double-digit growth. Now that we have the numbers and the momentum, we are confident of continuing on the growth trajectory for the entire financial year.”
TCS, — the Tata Group’s biggest cash cow that typically stays away from giving any outlook, said today it is confident that this fiscal will end with a better momentum than in the previous ones.
Large client wins (in retail and banking sectors), especially in the over-$100 million category, helped TCS grow rapidly during the quarter. Overall, It TCS saw client additions across all the key bands: four in the $100 million+ band, seven in $20 million+, 10 in $10 million+ band and 11 got added in the $l million+.
Digital revenues grew 59.8 per cent YoY. These accounted for 28.1 per cent of the overall revenues in Q2, against 25 per cent in Q1.
TCS posted operating margins of 26.5 per cent, up 140 basis points. “The rupee depreciation helped our margins by 130 basis points, while the rest was helped by improving efficiencies within the organisation,” said V Ramakrishnan, CFO.
While employee growth has been sluggish across the industry, TCS added 10,227 employees on a net basis in Q2, the highest net addition in 12 quarters. Total employee strength at the end of Q2 stood at 4,11,102.
“Our investments in organic talent development and innovative employee engagement initiatives continue to deliver best-in-class HR outcomes,” said Ajoy Mukherjee, Executive Vice-President and Global Head, Human Resources. 
“This quarter, we introduced yet another innovation, democratising the entry-level talent acquisition processes in India with the TCS National Qualifier Test."""

95,2018-10-12,TCS,"With national test, TCS speeds up hiring, gains better access to talent 


 At a time when most IT services companies are trimming their workforce, TCS has hired over 10,000 and continues to add to its team aggressively.
The biggest source of these hires has so far been campus placements. TCS visits 350-400 educational institutions to hire top talent. However, with the business growing based on sporadic increase in demand, hiring needs to be done in a way to ensure access to talent without hiring and putting them on bench.
“We decided to re-imagine the entire hiring process and decided to do a national test so that anyone, anywhere can come in as long as they meet our basic eligibility criteria,” Ajoy Mukherjee, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Human Resources, told BusinessLine.
TCS National Qualifier Test, the first of which was conducted in September, attracted nearly 2.2 lakh candidates. The company plans to give job offers to as many as 28,000.
“We will use the supply chain in a way that today what I need I'm hiring but tomorrow, if my business need is more, I’ll have pre- tested, pre-selected individuals who are in that database, ready to be hired,” Mukherjee said.
The common test, as against tests conducted at various institutes, has reduced the fresher hiring time to six weeks from four months earlier. The national test also means that TCS gets access to smart people who for some reason did not get entry into top institutes.
They don’t have to wait for off campus hiring,” Mukherjee said. 
 The test requires advanced computer science knowledge, creativity among other things. If qualified, the candidates end up getting salary packages almost double of what other candidates get.
TCS is using this to cater to the growing demand for digital talent, which is expensive to hire laterally and tough to search. The company has already retrained about 2.78 lakh of its workforce on digital technologies. Levers such as these are still required to compete aggressively in the market.
In the second quarter, TCS added 10,227 net new employees to its workforce. That’s twice of what it hired in the first quarter. “Hiring for us this year has been about 16,000 net as compared to last year when we did 7,700 for the full year. Net hiring is going up and is also reflected in our business growth. It reflects the demand that’s there and the kind of people that we need,” Mukherjee said.
The company signed deals worth $4.9 billion in the quarter while growing its revenues faster than it has done in the last eight quarters. The revival in demand came from banking and retail verticals, which had been weak for a long time. 
Mukherjee said that these hiring will continue to grow despite the company spending heavily on automation. 
“We are talking about machine-first delivery model at one end and on the other end we are hiring more. That’s because machine-first model doesn’t mean we don’t need people. It just means that there are some tasks that need to be automated and are getting automated. There are certain tasks for which you need intuitive, contexual knowledge and deeper domain and technology knowledge. Those things will remain with humans,” Mukherjee said."
93,2018-10-17,TCS,"IT firms’ buybacks hamper their future biz investment: Moody’s
 Share buybacks by information technology (IT) firms in the country impede their ability to invest for their future business needs, global ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service said on Wednesday.
It can be noted that the last few years have seen a high number of share buybacks from the country’s cash-rich IT companies.
“High levels of cash outflows to shareholders are reducing the ability of Indian IT services companies to respond to business demands, including acquisition of new technology, as well as research and development to meet fast-evolving customer needs,” said Saranga Ranasinghe, Assistant Vice-President, Moody’s Investors Service.
The agency, however, said Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, the top two software exporters, can be an exception to it. “TCS and Infosys, therefore, have the financial strength to invest in their businesses and respond to external pressures, despite their high shareholder payouts,” he said.
According to the agency, TCS and Infosys have cash balances of USD 6.6 billion and USD 4.4 billion, respectively.
However, others who had done buybacks, including Genpact, Marble II (Mphasis) and HT Global IT Solutions (Hexaware), have retained little cash for growth spending after returning large amounts to shareholders, it said. These three firms have a limited ability to incur fresh debt at their current rating levels, the agency added.
In the last year, five of the six IT firms it rates have returned back 130 per cent of cash flow from operations less capital spending to shareholders. 
The agency said it is important for companies to maintain “solid liquidity buffers” to respond to changing business conditions in the face of challenges like rising competition, pricing pressure and increasing employment costs. It expects the Indian IT firms to have a good showing in the next two years, largely due to demand for digital solutions."
94,2018-10-17,TCS,"TCS leads the pack
The stock of TCS corrected sharply by nearly 15 per cent over the past couple of weeks, largely on account of the across-the-board fall in broader markets.
But fundamentally, TCS continues to consistently deliver results that are ahead of market expectations.
During the September period, its revenues grew 3.2 per cent in dollar terms q-o-q. The operating margin sequentially expanded by over 140 basis points to 26.5 per cent. Growth was well-rounded across geographies and verticals. Large-sized client additions were healthy, and digital revenue growth was solid. TCS looks all set to record double-digit revenue growth in dollar terms for FY19.
Markets are willing to accord a substantial premium to the company: TCS’ price-earnings multiple — at 26 times trailing 12-months earnings — is higher than the 16-18 times that peers such as Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies trade at."
92,2018-10-27,TCS,"India’s TCS among top 10 firms to get foreign labour certification for H-1B visas 
Tata Consultancy Services is the only Indian company among top 10 firms to get foreign labour certification for the H-1B visas for the fiscal year 2018, according to data from the US Department of Labour.
The H-1B visas are the most sought-after among Indian IT professionals.
The visa programme allows employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in the US on a non-immigrant basis in specialty occupations or as fashion models of distinguished merit and ability.
London-headquartered Ernst & Young, a multinational professional services firm, has emerged as the top employer to have received the certification.
In fact, Ernst & Young with 151,164 H-1B specialist occupation labour certifications accounted for the 12.4 per cent of all foreign labour certification for the H-1B work visas for the fiscal year 2018 ended on September 30, according to the latest annual report released by the Department of Labour early this month.
Ernst & Young is followed by Deloitte Consulting which received 69,869 H-1B specialty occupations labour conditions programme.
Indian-American-owned Cognizant Technology Corp comes at number three with 47,732 specialty occupations labour conditions programme, the Department of Labour said in its latest annual report.
Cognizant is followed by HCL America (42,820), K Force Inc (32,996), and Apple (26,833).
Tata Consultancy Services or TCS is the only Indian company in top 10 for the year 2018.
According to the Department of Labour in the fiscal year 2018, ended on September 30, TCS had received 20,755 H-1B specialty occupation labour certifications.
Qualcomm Technologies (20,723), Mphasis Corporation (16,671) and Capgemini America (13,517) are the other companies in top 10.
In the 2018 fiscal year the Department of Labour’s Office of Foreign Labour Certification processed 654,360 applications for the H-1B specialty occupations labour conditions programme, of which 599,782 were certified, 8,627 were denied and 45,951 were withdrawn.
It received requests for 1,266,614 position of which 1,223,053 were certified.
Among the positions certified, software developers and applications accounted for nearly one-fourth with 285,963 positions being certified.
This was followed by computer systems analyst (176,025), Computer Occupations (120,736), Software developers, system software (67,262), accountants and auditors (54,2410 and computer programmers (53,727).
California with 309,205 certifications topped the list of States for getting maximum H-1B labour certification, followed by Texas (115,484), New York (95,722), New Jersey (65,232), Illinois (56,196), Washington (52,522) and Pennsylvania (51,471).
According to Department of labour, a specialty occupation requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of specialised knowledge and a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent in the specific specialty (for example, sciences, medicine, health care, education, biotechnology, and business specialties, etc.).
Congress has limited the annual number of qualifying foreign workers who may be issued a visa or otherwise be provided the H-1B status to 65,000 with an additional 20,000 under the H-1B advanced degree exemption.
Before applying for the H-1B visas the employer submits a labour condition application to the Department of labour. Companies can proceed with the H-1B petitions, only after they receive such a certification by the Department of labour."
90,2018-10-30,TCS,"IT’s raining jobs! Sept quarter sees hiring spike
The top three Indian IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro — reported a sharp increase in net employee hiring during the September 2018 quarter following good business wins, high employee utilisation and low bench strength. These were the highest hiring numbers for the three companies in the past 12 quarters.
Cognizant, too, saw good hiring during the quarter, but its number was much less than those of its competitors.
Together, the four companies’ net employee hiring was 34,048, nearly five times as many as in the corresponding quarter last year (6,435). In fact, in the September 2017 quarter, both Infosys and Cognizant reported a decline in net hiring (see chart).
Interestingly, the previous high net hiring for TCS, Infosys and Wipro was during the September 2015 quarter (27,045), when the industry was at its peak. However, from then on the industry has seen a decline in growth rates; recruitment numbers too dropped significantly, according to data collated by BusinessLine.
 








 
Over the last couple of years, IT companies have focussed on improving employee utilisation, reducing bench strength and tuning the existing employees in line with the digital transformation they were experiencing, which resulted in lower intake. However, this year they reported large project wins; average employee utilisation onsite reached a peak of around 90 per cent, and offshore around 85 per cent (excluding trainees). They also experienced higher attrition.
“These firms are showing stronger growth in their digital practices, which require new skills, and are therefore adding workers. Each of the firms has been experiencing high levels of attrition — 15-20 per cent — and have to hire afresh. Digital requires a mix shift in skills, which cannot be accomplished only by retraining, and hence there is increased hiring,” Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO, Everest Group, told BusinessLine.
Bozhidar Hristov, Senior Analyst at Technology Business Research, US, said cyclical changes — driven by rising attrition, demand for professionals with skills in new technologies that can not only execute on traditional outsourcing projects but can also drive design-led opportunities — are compelling Indian vendors to hire again.
Further, companies like TCS and Infosys have signed multi-year large-scale outsourcing deals, and additional resources are needed to support their execution, he added.
Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and Managing Director, TCS, said during an interaction with analysts that a substantial part of the hiring during the quarter was made up of local hires, which was the highest net addition that “we’ve done in the last 12 quarters.”"

89,2018-10-31,TCS,"Tata Sons, TCS violated rules in sacking Cyrus Mistry
 The abrupt sacking of Cyrus Mistry as the chairman and director, respectively, of Tata Sons and its crown jewel TCS violated provisions of the Companies Act, RBI rules and more importantly, Tatas’ own articles of association, RoC, Mumbai said in an RTI reply.
The right to information (RTI) reply, given by Uday Khomane, the assistant registrar of companies (RoC), Mumbai on October 3, is in response to a RTI request filed by the investment arms of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group on August 31.
The reply said the way Mistry was removed from the chairmanship of Tats Sons and also as the director of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), violated the relevant legal provisions under the Companies Act, 2013; the Reserve Bank rules governing NBFCs; and more importantly the rule 118 of the articles of association (AoA) of Tata Sons, the parent of the diversified Tata group, which is registered as an NBFC with the monetary authority.
A Tata Sons spokesman refused to offer detailed comments on the questions sent by PTI, saying, “We do not wish to comment on the matter as the matter is sub-judice.” 
PTI has seen a copy of the RTI reply which is based on the assessment of the documents furnished by the Tatas in the aftermath of the boardroom coup on October 24, 2016 dismissing Mistry as the group chairman.
The report offers an internal view of the RoC, which interestingly is totally opposite of the view taken by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai earlier this year while dismissing the petition filed by Mistry challenging his dismissal from the group.
Background
In a boardroom coup, Mistry was sacked as the chairman of Tata Sons on October 24, 2016, two months short of four years in the corner room of the Bombay House, the global headquarters of the 150-old conglomerate that nets over 65 per cent of its income from outside the country.
Mistry, whose family is the single largest non-Tata shareholder with 18.4 per cent stake in Tata Sons, was nudged to take over the reins of the USD 103-billion group as the second non-Tata chairman, after Nowroji Saklatwala (1934-38), in December 2012, after group patriarch Ratan Tata retired.
Mistry was removed as TCS director with 93.11 per cent votes at the EGM held on December 13, 2016, as per its company secretaries Parikh & Associates which cited section 169(2) of the Companies Act 2013 read with section 115 and 100 (2)(a) for his removal.
But TCS did not send out the complete representation of Mistry to all shareholders, which violates section 169 (4)(b) of the Companies Act, noted the RoC reply.
The RTI reply is based on the queries posed by SP Kumar, western regional director, RoC, Mumbai which has found that Tata Sons violated rule 118 of its articles of its AoA, when it removed Mistry.
The report, exclusively available with PTI, states that “article 118 of the AoA of Tata Sons prescribes that its chairman can be removed in the same process as specified for his appointment i.e. by the selection committee consisting of four persons and based on such recommendation of the removal committee only the board is empowered to remove its chairman“.
It goes on to add that Tata Sons “being an NBFC duly registered with RBI, any management change requires prior approval of the RBI”, which was also not complied with.
The reply also cited several irregularities pertaining to the December 13, 2016 EGM convened by TCS to remove Mistry as a director from its board.
TCS had adopted a letter written by the company secretary and chief operating officer of Tata Sons on November 9, 2016 as a special resolution notice to sack Mistry.
The reply noted that this letter from Tata Sons was sent to TCS without any proof of a board resolution authorising the issuance of such a letter. The report also states that “it appears prima facie that there was no proper ’special notice’ received” by TCS.
The RoC also said that the TCS’ company secretary thereafter “on his own” forwarded the purported special notice from Tata Sons dated November 9, 2016 to Mistry.
 “The letter dated November 11, 2016 written by the VP & CS of TCS is against the provisions of section 169(3) of the Companies Act of 2013 as the power to send such a letter is vested with the board of the company,” noted the RoC report.
 The RoC further noted that “since there was no TCS board meeting between November 9 and 11, 2016, and in the absence of any board resolution authorising the actions of the TCS’ company secretary, such a letter and the resulting actions would be void ab-initio“.
 Additionally, TCS had also failed to send out the complete shareholder representation of Mistry to all shareholders, “in violation of section 169(4)(b) of the Companies Act”, and hence “the consequential resolution of EGM dated December 13, 2016 for the removal of Mistry would also be void“.
 The RoC, Mumbai in a letter dated January 25, 2017 had written to the regional director of the corporate affairs ministry highlighting these concerns.
 “As the verification of the relevant documents further finds that the company has violated the provisions of the Companies Act, and rules there under, I am referring the matter to the regional director to verify the findings in terms of rule 11(2) of the Companies (registration offices and fees) rules of 2014,” the letter read.
 In the reply, SP Kumar, RoC Mumbai, in a letter dated February 17, 2017, stated, “RoC having come to the conclusion that transactions are void [Annexure C point (1) to (4)] has to express in unequivocal words whether the e-form is to be rejected or e-form or document as the case may be, as invalid in the electronic record in terms of rule 10(4) of Companies (Registration Offices and Fees) Rules, 2014.” 
However, it is unclear what further action the ministry took on these observations, it noted.
 Mistry and his elder brother Shapoor Mistry, through their investment companies, are the single largest non-Tata shareholder in Tata Sons with 18.4 percent stake.
The group’s investment companies are currently waging a legal battle against Tata Sons in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal alleging oppression of the minority shareholders and mismanagement at Tata Sons. The tribunal began hearing the case Wednesday in New Delhi."

82,2018-12-11,TCS,"Adobe, Nvidia, Microsoft best tech companies to work for in India: Indeed 
 Adobe tops the list of leading technology organisations to work for in India, followed by Nvidia and Microsoft in the second and third positions, respectively, job site Indeed said Tuesday.
According to the Top-Rated Workplaces: Best in Tech report, as rated by Indian employees on Indeed, multinational companies continued to dominate the list.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) was the highest-ranked Indian organisation at number 10, and the only public sector firm to feature on the list.
Others in the top ten list include, SAP, Akamai Technologies, VMware, Cisco, Intel and Citrix Systems Inc.
“The top five workplaces on the list are multinational corporations (MNCs) — a clear indication that Indian job seekers see greater scope for career advancement and work exposure in large international firms when it comes to the technology sector,” the report said.
Some of the other Indian companies that feature in the top 15 list include e-commerce company Myntra and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).
“In addition to strategic and meaningful workplace programmes, companies that have focused on people management, and contributed to creating a conducive environment for their employees have been highly rated by job-seekers,” Indeed India Managing Director, Sashi Kumar, said.
Kumar further added that “apart from competitive remuneration, companies that work to make their employees feel like they work with and not for the company, create a culture of ownership and instil a sense of loyalty in their employees”.
Top-Rated Workplace lists are determined at Indeed’s sole discretion based on user rankings. Indeed used a proprietary algorithm to rank companies using a variety of factors, such as average rating, number of reviews, and the history of job openings. But in general, companies with a large number of high ratings will place higher in the rankings."
81,2018-12-18,TCS,"TCS collaborates with Red Hat to build digital transformation solutions 


Tata Consultancy Services on Tuesday extended its collaboration with Red Hat to build microservices-based open source solutions and frameworks that will accelerate customers’ digital transformation journeys. 
The collaboration aims to develop industry-specific as well as cross-industry horizontal solutions and frameworks leveraging the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, machine learning algorithms, natural language processing engines, and other Red Hat specific products and technologies. These solutions will help customers accelerate their shift away from legacy monolithic systems, towards more agile, cloud native, containerized applications based on open source technologies, in hybrid environments, TCS said in a statement.
Business 4.0
To be built by TCS’ Global Business Solutions Labs in Cincinnati, the solutions address all four pillars of TCS’ Business 4.0 thought leadership framework – intelligent, agile, automated, and on the cloud. “Together, TCS and Red Hat plan to bring our customers a set of solutions that leverages our contextual knowledge, domain expertise and the Business 4.0 thought leadership framework, and based on Red Hat’s open source technologies. These differentiated, interoperable solutions will help our customers accelerate their digital transformation journeys and succeed in today’s fast paced, outcome-focused digital environment,” said Raman Venkatraman, Vice President and Global Head, Alliances & Technology Unit, TCS.
Technology skills
“Red Hat and TCS’ long standing, successful collaboration is now extending around DevOps, data science, AI/machine-learning, and cyber security. We see tremendous business value in TCS’ solutions on Red Hat’s OpenShift Container Platform. By leveraging TCS’ technology skills to build more secure, intelligent and responsive solutions, we aim to deliver superior end user experiences, offer new growth opportunities to our customers and accelerate their digital transformation journeys,” said Larry Stack, Senior Vice President, Global Accounts and Target Industries, Red Hat."

India’s largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has appointed Hanne Birgitte Breinbjerg Sorensen and Keki M Mistry as additional and independent directors of the company for five years.
They have been appointed with effect from Tuesday, TCS said in a regulatory filing.
The appointment is based on the recommendations of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and subject to the approval of shareholders.
With this latest addition, the board now has six independent directors out of a total of 10 directors.
Sorensen has held various senior-level executive positions within the AP Moller-Maersk A/S Group in Denmark. In her recent executive roles, she was the chief executive officer (CEO) of Damco, a Dutch supply chain management company, from 2014 to 2016.
Currently, she is on the boards of Tata Motors, Jaguar Land Rover Automotive, Delhivery, Ferrovial, LafargeHolcim and Sulzer.
Mistry is the Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Housing Development Finance Corporation and is on the board of Torrent Power Ltd.
“I’m delighted to welcome Hanne Sorensen and Keki Mistry to our board. They are established corporate leaders in their respective fields and TCS will immensely benefit from their deep knowledge and rich experience in business and corporate governance,” said N Chandrasekaran, Chairman of the board of directors, TCS."
79,2018-12-20,TCS,"Digital leap: CA Institute ropes in TCS as SaaS partner
The CA Institute has roped in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to develop and run its prestigious UDIN project, a top official said.
As part of its digital journey, the CA Institute has also decided to adopt the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model in a big way for most of its activities around its members and students and has brought in TCS as the SaaS provider, Naveen Gupta, President, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), told BusinessLine here.
TCS will also automate and maintain the life cycle of CA members and students, implying that engagement of nearly 3 lakh members and 8 lakh students with the accounting body will now be largely online on a digital platform maintained by TCS.
To enable TCS do the data migration and data audit before the UDIN platform becomes mandatory, the Central Council of the CA Institute has now decided to defer the date of UDIN becoming mandatory to February 1 next year as against the earlier announced date of January 1, Gupta said.
Gupta, however, declined to go into the commercial aspects of the TCS contract, which is expected to run into crores.
It may be recalled that UDIN (Unique Document Identification Number) was conceptualised to tackle the menace of forged certifications of financial statements and documents.
TCS estimates about 55 lakh UDINs will get generated and maintained in India
Regulators and banks can use the portal to check the authenticity of the documents. TCS will set up a 24x7 help desk either at Noida/Mumbai/Kanpur with toll-free numbers and 5-7 tele-callers so that no difficulty is faced by any regulator and member regarding UDIN.
As part of slew of reforms on the examinations front, the CA Institute has decided to introduce the concept of “re-evaluation” of answer books.
“We have now initiated talks with the UGC, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Ministry of HRD to help us provide the best practices adopted by universities on this front,” Gupta said. Also, from November this year, digital marking has been introduced in five papers at the intermediate level. This will be expanded to more papers in the next exam. All existing examiners will be required to undergo an online refresher crash course and pass the online test in their respective subjects once every three years."
78,2019-01-08,TCS,"IT sector: secular growth visible
TCS and Infosys are set to kick off the earnings season of Indian IT services companies this week. After a good run through the year so far, the sector is set to face some roadblocks. We look at how it may impact the third-quarter results.
“We expect growth acceleration in Q3, and for all top five IT service providers third-quarter year-on-year (y-o-y) growth should be better than second-quarter y-o-y growth. This is because of large deal wins in the last 12 months across the board, whose benefits will continue to accrue in Q3,” said Pareekh Jain, founder of Pareekh Consulting.
Despite fears of digitalisation cutting down deal sizes, IT companies in the past year were able to crack some of the largest deals in their history. TCS, for example, bagged three multi-year billion-dollar deals, totalling more than $5 billion in revenue since December 2017. Wipro in September won its largest ever $1.5 billion contract from Illinois-based Alight Solutions LLC, a deal spread over 10 years. HCL Technologies signed a five-year deal with Nokia worth over $500 million.
“Gradually improving y-o-y growth rates, anticipated continuum of the same in Q3, FY19 and a strong order book have all been indicators of secular strength in demand for IT Services. Growth is expected to continue accelerating into 3QFY19 (our estimate: 8.9 per cent y-o-y CC), contributed by good progress at each of the top five clients,” said analysts at brokerage firm Motilal Oswalin a note.
“We expect 11.7 per cent y-o-ygrowth at TCS — the highest among tier-I — while TECHM should lag with 4.7 per cent y-o-y CC growth, given sluggish momentum in Communications. We expect growth at INFO to accelerate to nine per cent y-o-y CC from 8.1 per cent in Q2, FY19,” the note added. 
The trade war between the US and China has already seen Apple lowering its revenue guidance for the year. This should be seen a warning sign for the overall IT services industry as growth slowing in the US will have a heavy impact on Indian IT in the long run. 
Analysts are expecting some commentary from the IT services companies on the impact of this likely slowdown in the US, as well as the ramifications of Brexit. The US continues to be the biggest market for the entire Indian IT industry, despite its efforts to expand presence in other geographies. 
“In our view, key monitorables for the street from the Q3 results are likely to be digital growth and deal size trends, outlook for key verticals including BFSI, Retail and Telecommunications and CY19 IT budget outlook. Apart from this, deal flows and order book are critical data points to watch out for,” Harit Shah, research analyst at Reliance Securities said. 
Reliance Securities expects the IT firms under its coverage universe to post a combined 1.4 per cent quarter on quarter rise in dollar revenue in the third quarter.
The rise of Indian currency could also reflect in the upcoming earnings report from the sector. 
Compared to Q2, Rupee appreciated about up to nearly three per cent against major currencies such as the US dollar, Euro, Pound Sterling and Australian dollar in Q3. 
“We expect 50-70 bps adverse impact of cross-currency movement in Q3, FY19 for top-tier IT firms, while for mid-tier IT firms, impact is seen at 25-45 bps,” Shah said. 
According to Reliance Securities, the top five IT firms are likely to post 0.7-2.1 per cent q-o-q dollar-revenue growth (1.3-2.6 per cent q-o-q in CC terms) with Tech Mahindra likely to lead the pack (2.1 per cent q-o-q dollar growth, 2.6 per cent CC growth). Among mid-sized firms, Persistent Systems is expected to out-perform with 6.6 per cent q-o-q dollar-revenue growth led by IP business seasonality, while Cyient is likely to trail (flattish revenue owing to weak DLM seasonality). 
Revenue growth is likely to come in at 2-9 per cent q-o-q, owing to Rupee depreciation, as per Reliance Securities.
On the margin front, Wipro is expected to post 200 bps EBIT margin expansion in its Combined IT Services business led by absence of one-time items and Rupee depreciation. 
Other top-tier firms are expected to post largely range-bound margins with some margin gains likely to be reinvested to sustain revenue growth, going forward."

In a seasonally weak December quarter, TCS managed to deliver a steady set of numbers. On the revenue front, there was little to complain, though margins came in a tad lower, thanks to volatile dollar-rupee exchange rate movement.
But on key parameters, the company delivered broad-based growth across geographies and verticals, increased the count of large-sized clients significantly and continued the thrust on digital offerings during the third quarter.
During the December period, the company’s revenues grew by 0.7 per cent in dollar terms (1.8 per cent in constant currency) sequentially. The operating margin came in at 25.6 per cent, a bit lower than the previous quarter, though on an absolute basis, it is among the highest in the industry.








 
 
All large verticals — BFSI (banking financial services and insurance), retail, CPG and regional markets that together account for 66 per cent of overall revenues — grew for TCS during the December quarter. Other segments, such as communications, life-sciences and manufacturing too expanded at a steady pace.
The digital business grew at a scorching pace of 52.7 per cent year on year (y-o-y) and now accounts for 30.1 per cent of the overall revenues. Revenues from key geographies, including the Americas (North and South) and Europe, increased at a healthy clip. The latter region expanded at a faster pace than the overall company’s revenue rate.
The growth across verticals and geographies suggests that there has been broad-based client traction. In an environment where large deals are rare, the company has managed to add one customer each in the $100-million and $50-million buckets. In the $10-million category, it has added five customers. Attrition inched up a little but was still reasonable at 11.2 per cent.
As TCS looks all set to deliver double-digit dollar revenue growth for FY19 — it has delivered 10-12 per cent y-o-y in each of the three quarters of FY19 — it continues to justify the premium valuations it gets vis-a-vis peers. This growth would be higher than the revenue increase that trade body Nasscom has projected for the industry (7-9 per cent) in FY19.
Also, TCS is likely to be the only player to deliver double-digit dollar revenue growth for FY19 among top-tier software services firms. Barring possibly HCL Technologies, others may significantly lag TCS on the growth front."

TCS MD and CEO Rajesh Gopinathan




TCS had posted a net profit of Rs 6,531 crore in the same period last fiscal as per Indian accounting norms


Mumbai, January 10 IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services reported 24.1 per cent growth in net profit at ₹8,105 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, compared with ₹6,531 crore in the same period last fiscal.
Revenues for the quarter grew 20.8 per cent year-on-year to ₹37,338 crore against ₹30,904 crore. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 12.1 per cent.
TCS said it had a total contract value of $5.9 billion for the quarter, way above the $4.9 billion registered in the July-September quarter.
“We are wrapping up 2018 with a strong revenue growth of 12.1 per cent in the December quarter, which is the highest in 14 quarters, with continued growth acceleration in key verticals and across all geographies,” TCS’ MD and CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said in a statement.
The company is looking at a strong deal momentum and does not expect any medium-term impact from macro economic headwinds, he added.
The digital share of TCS revenue has been on the rise and now accounts for 30.1 per cent of the total, up 52.7 per cent YoY. The UK and Europe registered the strongest YoY growth for the company at 25.1 per cent and 17.6 per cent respectively. Growth in its largest market, North America, stood at 8.2 per cent in constant currency terms.
CFO V Ramakrishnan said despite headwinds from rupee volatility, and the higher cost of doing business in some major markets, TCS’ operating margins have been resilient. Margins were up 40 basis points to 25.6 per cent, but below the company’s stated target of 26-28 per cent.
During Q3, TCS added 6,827 people (net), taking the employee strength to 4,17,929. Attrition rate was at 11.2 per cent on a last twelve months (LTM) basis.
TCS said hiring has been strong in the US. “There is a supply constraint in the US. We are hiring both contractual employees and direct hires to meet demand,” Gopinathan said. The company has declared a third interim dividend of ₹4 per equity share."

The stock went down by 2.45 per cent to end at Rs 1,841.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). During the day, it slipped 2.75 per cent to Rs 1,836.10.
At the National Stock Exchange (NSE), shares of the company declined 2.38 per cent to close at Rs 1,843.45 apiece.
“TCS delivered a mixed bag for 3QFY19, with in-line revenues, but tepid earnings before Interest and Tax (EBIT) margin. Higher other income helped PAT, which was in line with estimates,” Centrum Broking said in a note.
In terms of equity volume, 5.31 lakh shares of the company were traded on the BSE and over 92 lakh shares changed hands at the NSE during the day.
The country’s largest software exporter TCS on Thursday reported a 24.1 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 8,105 crore for the quarter ended December.
The company had posted a net profit of Rs 6,531 crore in the corresponding period of the previous financial year as per Indian accounting norms.
The Tata group firm, which accounts for the lion’s share of the group’s overall profit, reported a revenue growth of 20.8 per cent at Rs 37,338 crore for the said quarter, up from Rs 30,904 crore a year ago."

CMP: ₹1,841.95
Target: ₹2,190
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has reported a decent CC revenue growth of 1.8 per cent q-o-q in 3QFY19, while USD revenue came in softer-than-expected at $5,250 million (+0.7 per cent q-o-q, below our estimate by 0.8 per cent) owing to a higher-than-expected adverse cross-currency impact. Its TCV order bookings grew by a robust >20 per cent q-o-q to $5.9 billion (versus $4.9 billion in 2QFY19), with book-to-bill rising strongly to 1.12x (versus 0.94x in 2QFY19), which signals a strong traction in underlying business growth. On the flip side, its EBIT margin declined by 90 bps q-o-q to 25.6 per cent (missing our estimate by 73 bps) owing to higher wage cost and SG&A expenses. Net profit rose by 2.6 per cent q-o-q to cross ₹8,100 crore (1.5 per cent below our estimate) aided by substantially higher other income (+59.3 per cent q-o-q) on forex gains.
From a vertical perspective, Life Sciences & Healthcare (+2 per cent q-o-q), Energy & Utilities (+2.9 per cent) and Regional Markets & Others (+2.3 per cent) saw decent growth in dollar USD terms. However, BFSI (-0.6 per cent q-o-q in dollar USD terms) and Retail (+0.1 per cent q-o-q) performed below the company average. 
High payouts to shareholders in the form of share buybacks along with good business visibility will ensure the stock to remain at elevated valuations. Trimming our EPS estimates marginally to factor in lower-than-estimated quarterly performance, we maintain our Buy recommendation on the stock with a revised Target Price of ₹2,190 (from ₹2,260 earlier)."

 The recent gains have been narrowly focused this year, with only a handful of stocks, including Reliance Industries Ltd and software exporters Infosys Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, driving the National Stock Exchange’s (NSE) Nifty 50 Index of India’s large caps. That advance has pared, and the gauge is almost back to flat. The benchmark S&P Sensex of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), on the other hand, is still about one per cent higher for 2019, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s gain is seven times stronger. 
As Prime Minister Narendra Modi frets about his upcoming re-election bid, here are other things that have also been on investors minds: A surprise interest-rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). 
While cheaper borrowing costs tend to be a good for stocks, one concern is they could hurt the exchange rate, pushing up inflation.
Some United States (US)-China trade jitters relayed in earnings. Debt concerns plagued conglomerates including IL&FS group, Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group as well as a bankruptcy filing by billionaire Anil Ambani’s wireless carrier and a sell-off that spread to other firms within his group.
In fact, setting aside short-term volatility expected around elections, the votes themselves are not expected to be a key driver for the long-term health of markets even if Modi gets ousted, according to analysts and investors.
Anand Radhakrishnan, Chief Investment Officer of equity at Franklin Templeton Asset Management India Pvt, said at a press conference in Mumbai last week that elections can only boost or dampen sentiment depending on the news flow, but they wont massively impact the underlying earnings and economic growth of the country.
The firm will continue to invest in India’s consumption, infrastructure and reform story for the next 20 years and is betting on banks, automobiles, consumer firms and software exporters to report good profit and revenue growth for the next few years.
“While the formation of a stable government is important for the sake of continuity, previous election cycles have shown neither growth nor reform stall if a government changes. Polls may pose a near-term risk for equities, but beyond that markets will focus on the trajectory of earnings. So far, 31 of the 45 Nifty 50 companies that have reported results this season have beaten or met analyst projections,” Societe Generale SA analysts Kunal Kundu and Rajat Agarwal said in a recent report.
There’s one technical indicator that could give investors something to get excited about. The Nifty 50s 50-day moving average is set to break above its 200-day line to form a technical indicator known as the golden cross. That’s typically seen as a bullish indicator.
At the moment, however, trade concerns are weighing on at least some corporate earnings.
Jaguar owner Tata Motors Ltd sank the most in 26 years on February 8 after reporting the biggest quarterly loss in India’s corporate history due to a slump in Chinas car market that’s affected automakers around the world. The decline dragged the Nifty 50 to a 1.1 per cent drop, its worst since December. On Monday, shares of Tata Motors took another hit after Jaguar Land Rover said that conditions aren’t right for it to borrow from the bond market and that its seeking alternative funding.
That said, India’s equities are otherwise still trending toward stabilization. The monthly average intraday move for the Sensex has slipped for a second straight month in February after spiking at the end of last year."

67,2019-02-25,TCS,"IT firms see spike in sub-contracting costs 


IT employees (file photo).




IT employees (file photo).


As domestic IT players seek to deliver new-generation and digital services, they are looking beyond their in-house talent pools to hire sub-contractors and external professionals. They are willing to pay more for these sub-contractors as the crunch for qualified employees with new-age technical skill-sets gets intense.
Usually, most of these recruitments pertain to on-site (or overseas) locations, though hiring for external professionals happens for domestic operations, too. Issues related to H-1B visas in the US are also leading to an increase in such hiring.
Consider this: for TCS and Infosys, sub-contracting costs increased 25.6 per cent and 38.9 per cent respectively for the first nine months of FY19 compared to the same period in FY18, while their employee expenses rose only 18 per cent and 15.3 per cent respectively.
For mid-tier players such as Mindtree and Zensar Technologies, sub-contracting costs rose a whopping 59.3 per cent and 69.5 per cent respectively, even as their employee costs increased by less than half those levels.
Given that many new digital projects tend to be short-term or one-off in nature, it also helps IT firms to juggle talent based on client requirements.
“Sub-contracting costs have risen due to a combination of issues including the challenge in obtaining H-1B visas for sending employees from India and the crunch for local talent in the US,” says Ashish Chopra, Sr Group VP & IT Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
“While niche skill requirements can be fulfilled by hiring full-time employees, it may take more time, thereby causing a delay in the commencement of a project. Hence companies take recourse to sub-contractors to execute the projects in a timely manner.”
The increase in digital deals won by Indian IT vendors has accentuated the trend. “Digital contracts require on-site delivery and domain specific talent. Also, the size of the digital contracts is rising and so is the demand for talent,” says Amit Chandra, Analyst - IT, HDFC Securities. “Digital as a percentage of revenue for Indian IT firms is around 30 per cent and growing at 32 per cent YoY. Most of the large deals are in the transition stage and sub-contracting is the only option to the fulfil talent gap and timely delivery.”
Harit Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Reliance Securities, adds: “Shortage of trained digital workers is a bigger driver for hiring more subcontractors than the visa issue. Digital projects — whether one-off or slightly long term — need to be adequately staffed with skilled resources.”
Though hiring consultants or sub-contractors for a short duration would have the desirable effect of not adding to the employee count, it does not optimise costs for software vendors. Also, given that they bring niche skills to the table, their price tags are higher.
Chandra of HDFC Securities throws more light on this aspect: “There is a severe talent crunch in the US due to a huge demand for new-age programmers. There are many vacant positions and companies are hiring a lot of freelance programmers to fulfil the demand. The cost is $200,000-300,000, which is way higher than the average size of $90,000-120,000 for a programmer on an H-1B Visa,” he says, adding: “Sub-contracting costs as a percentage of sales have increased by 200-250 basis points and have impacted margins for IT firms.”"

62,2019-03-16,TCS,"Tata Consultancy to celebrate 10 years of association with TCS World 10K


 The 12th edition of the world’s premier Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) World 10K, the IAAF Gold Label Race will be flagged off from the Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru on May 19.
This year as well organisers are expecting the consistency of attracting the best elite runners as well as enthusiastic amateurs from across the globe.
Vivek Singh, Joint Managing Director Procam International said, “This year, the TCS World 10K celebrates the sense of pride the run provides to all stakeholders associated with the event. Additionally, our renewed vision for the Majja Run is in line with the country’s move towards a culture of fitness and the joy of competing with oneself and with each other. As always, the event continues to set new milestones and we are proud of putting Bengaluru on the global running map with the unrelenting support of our city authorities, partners and our runners. #FeelthePride and join in for the twelfth edition of the event.”
Commenting on a 10 year long association with the run, Nagraj Ijari, Vice President & Head, TCS Bangalore Operations said, ""We are always excited to be back - and this year is even more special, because this year we celebrate our tenth year of being associated with this event. An association we feel that has gone by so fast.""
""Within TCS we also take fitness very seriously, and have multiple initiatives that support that vision including Fit for Life, that encourages a lot of people to clock miles. And last financial year we our Bangalore offices clocked about 2.3 million kms among all our associates in Bangalore and are confident to doubling the number with 4.6 million kms already registered,” he added.
Eco-friendly
TCS World 10K over the years has consciously taken steps to be an environmentally friendly and a 100 per cent waste managed race. HasiruDala Innovations, a social enterprise-focused on creating better livelihoods for waste pickers will spear-head and advise on different eco-friendly alternatives to ensure efficient waste management and over-see last mile disposal and consequent recycling plans.
Beyond being a globally acclaimed sporting event that puts Bengaluru on an international racing calendar, the TCS World 10K today is also recognized for the phenomenal impact it creates in terms of social change through the Cubbon Park Rejuvenation Program, Madiwalla Urban Forest and being the largest sporting charity platform in South India. This is what makes Bengalurens proud hosts of a race that is a celebration of sport and spirit of the city.
Registrations
Registrations which open on March 17, will close on April 26 or earlier, depending on availability of running spots, with a priority line-up for the Open 10K participants and dedicated spots for first-time Women runners.
The $2,13,000 race is headlined by the Elite World 10K for Men and Women; amateurs competing in the Open 10K, running enthusiasts in the 5Km Majja Run, the 4Km Senior Citizens Run for participants above the age of 60 and the Champions with Disability.
The Majja Run which through the years has always attracted the highest number of amateur runners, will be introduced in a new avataar this year. The 5KM Run is now a completely timed category and will provide each registered runner with a timing chip in his/her personalised bib as well as a medal of completion on their finish. This initiative by Procam International, keeps with its vision of encouraging a healthier community as well as providing an opportunity for runners from across age categories including as young as 12-years a chance to be part of this mega event."

59,2019-04-10,TCS,"TCS, Google partner to build industry-specific cloud solutions


Tata Consultancy Services on Wednesday partnered with Google Cloud to build industry-specific cloud solutions.

TCS offers a set of cloud enablement services on GCP, applying the Machine-First Delivery Model across advisory, design and build, migration, platform engineering, cloud management, SAP on cloud, and data insight services, amongst others. 
This will be augmented with the new industry-specific cloud solutions, such as retail analytics on SAP HANA, designed to help customers harness the full power of GCP.
TCS’ Data and Analytics Estate Modernization solution is now available on GCP.

56,2019-04-12,TCS,"Infosys, TCS post strong numbers in a usually weak fourth quarter
In a seasonally weak March quarter, the top two IT majors — TCS and Infosys — delivered a robust set of numbers. 
The revenue growth of both the companies was healthy. 
While TCS scored in terms of broad-based traction across key verticals, Infosys reported solid additions to its list of large-sized clients.
Both companies have also reported healthy digital revenues. 
The one aspect that may leave the markets disappointed is the decline in the operating margins recorded by the IT majors.
During the fourth quarter, Infosys’ revenue grew 2.4 per cent sequentially in dollar terms, while TCS reported a 2.8 per cent increase in sales.
The operating margins stood at 25.6 per cent for TCS and at 21.5 per cent for Infosys, a sequential dip of 40 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively.
Digital revenues grew at a solid pace of 46.4 per cent year on year (YoY) for TCS and at 41.1 per cent for Infosys during the March quarter. 
This steady growth indicates that both the companies majors have been able to tap the digital spends of clients on a significant scale.
During the period, Infosys managed to add two clients to the $100-million bucket and one in the $50-million category. 
TCS reported additions only in the relatively smaller bands of $20 million and $10 million. However, the company witnessed broad-based growth across various verticals including banking and financial services, retail, communication and manufacturing, which reported faster growth compared to the company’s overall revenue rate. 
Infosys’ growth, on the other hand, was more narrowly led, with only the communication and hi-tech verticals reporting solid traction.
Attrition, which was at 20.4 per cent during the quarter, continues to rise for Infosys 
For TCS, attrition was recorded at 11.3 per cent.
Infosys ended FY19 with a revenue growth of 9 per cent, while TCS finished with an 11.7 per cent growth in sales.
With a strong deal momentum, Infosys does look set to meet the upper end of its revenue guidance (7.5-9.5 per cent) for FY20. 
With TCS too appearing on course to achieving double-digit growth in the new fiscal, the IT industry is likely to be on a high for the next year or so. 
Of course, the margins could come under pressure while chasing large deals. 
However, there still appears to be considerable headroom to manoeuvre for the top two players.
TCS continues to command premium valuations, trading as it does at over 25 times its trailing 12 months per share earnings.
Infosys has delivered well under the new management for much of 2018-19. 
But it may take a couple of more quarters of solid performance from Infosys — which trades at a price-earnings multiple of 21 times — before markets accord the company the same valuation multiple that it assigns to TCS."

Tata Consultancy Services, the country’s largest software firm, has posted a 17.7 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at ₹8,126 crore during the conventionally soft fourth quarter. The company witnessed a broad-based growth in most of the verticals for the quarter ended March 31.
TCS had posted a net profit of ₹6,904 crore during the comparable quarter in the previous year.
For the reporting period, revenues rose by 18.5 per cent to ₹ 38,010 crore, compared with ₹32,075 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.
“This is the strongest revenue growth that we have had in the last 15 quarters. Our order book is bigger than in the prior three quarters and the deal pipeline is also robust. Despite macro uncertainties ahead, our strong exit positions us well for the new fiscal,” TCS Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Rajesh Gopinathan said in a press conference. Industry-wise, BFSI grew at 11.6 per cent, Life Sciences & Healthcare at 18.2 per cent, Energy & Utilities at 11.3 per cent, Communications & Media at 10 per cent, Retail & CPG at 9.9 per cent and Manufacturing at 9.2 per cent per cent. All major markets posted a strong growth momentum, with UK leading with a 21.3 per cent growth.
For the 12-month period ended March 31, TCS posted a consolidated net profit of ₹31,472 crore, up 21.9 per cent compared with ₹25,826 crore in the same year-ago period on revenues of ₹1,46,463 crore (vs ₹1,23,104 crore).
“It is a very satisfying finish to a year marked by steady growth acceleration and order book expansion every quarter. The expanding scale and scope of our cognitive business operations engagements have been central to our growth,” N Ganapathy Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer, said.
Total employee strength stood at 4,24,285 on a consolidated basis as of FY19, following a net addition of 29,287 employees during the year. Its proportion of women in the workforce rose to 35.9 per cent in Q4, and the total number of nationalities stood at 147."

In a departure from the past year, entry-level hiring is robust in India’s top two software exporters.
TCS and Infosys, which both posted their annual results today, said that net additional hires for the year were more than 50,000. 
TCS hired 29,287 employees and Infosys hired 24,016 techies in the 2018-19 fiscal. 
TCS total employee headcount was 4,24,285 and Infosys closed 2019 fiscal at 2,28,123 employees.
In comparison, both the IT majors added a total of around 11,000 employees in 2018 fiscal.
Further, Infosys said that it has crossed 10,000 employees in the US, which includes re-badging of people. Re-badging is industry terminology for transferring people from a customer to an incoming supplier for projects.
Other software exporters, such as Wipro, HCL and Cognizant are expected to announce their results this month. 
This development comes in the backdrop of IT companies handing out pink slips in 2017-18 as a result of lack of projects, automation, migration to cloud computing and others.
The shake-up has passed, and it augurs well for the future, said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder, TeamLease and President, Indian Staffing Federation.
Industry watchers believe that the transformation of Indian software exporters, coupled with success in digital business are some of the reasons for this uptick in hiring. 
Also, the IT sector has performed well in the past 12 months on the back of currency tailwinds with the Dollar hitting the 70 mark recently.
“The market is definitely better off this year when compared to the last one,” said Kris Lakshmikanth, CEO, Head Hunters India.
A bulk of the hiring is happening at the entry-level, according to industry watchers. According to a cutshort.io report, Bangalore, Pune, Delhi and Hyderabad constitute roughly 65 per cent of the talent pool of full stack developers.
“Also, with this hiring numbers, companies are showing that they are seeing confidence in the near future and this is an effort to beef up the bench,” said Lakshmikanth.
Infosys has also doled out 2,500 promotions. Salary hikes offshore were 6 per cent, and onsite hikes were in the range of 1-1.5 per cent, said COO Pravin Rao."
55,2019-04-14,TCS,"TCS says ‘hungry’ for acquisitions, eyes further acceleration in growth 


TCS COO, N Ganapathy Subramaniam




TCS COO, N Ganapathy Subramaniam


 India’s largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is “hungry” for acquisitions and is scouting for assets that can bring in intellectual property and widen market reach to further accelerate growth.
Speaking to PTI, Chief Operating Officer N Ganapathy Subramaniam said TCS had acquired two entities -- W12 and BridgePoint Group -- last year and both of them have been integrated well with the Mumbai-based firm.
“We continue to remain open and hungry for acquisitions. We have one of the best track records in terms of acquiring companies and integrating them... the approach is that clearly, we are in the market looking for the right asset which will add certain amount of IP (intellectual property), market reach or client addition,” he said.
TCS, which had acquired French SAP service provider acquire Alti SA for 75 million euros (about ₹ 533 crore) in 2013, has been focussing on organic growth even as its global and domestic rivals went on an acquisition spree.
Infosys acquired consumer insights agency WongDoody for USD 75 million last year. Wipro’s investment in the digital space includes entities like Designit and Cooper.
TCS, in November last year, announced the acquisition of W12 Studios (for an undisclosed amount). A digital design studio based in London, the acquisition of W12 was part of TCS’ efforts to bolster its digital and creative design capabilities.
In the same month, TCS acquired the business of BridgePoint Group, LLC, a US management consulting firm (for an undisclosed sum).
Asked about the opportunities in the market, Subramaniam said there are options, especially among startups.
“Some of the startups are doing very well, blockchain is an area where lot of firms have come up. There are many who are working on future of financial services, future of cash, future of payments... so we continue to watch closely some of those technologies and startup firms, how their business models are emerging,” he said.
Subramaniam asserted that if TCS found the right framework, it “will not hesitate” to make an offer.
“It has to make sense in terms of both value and the combined value of TCS and the asset that we are acquiring should really be great,” he added.

54,2019-04-21,TCS,"TCS modernises 1.5 lakh post offices under multi-year deal with India Post
 The IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) said it has deployed an integrated solution for India Post that has helped modernise a network of more than 1.5 lakh post offices in the country.
 In 2013, the Mumbai-based company had announced receiving an over Rs 1,100- crore multi-year contract from the Department of Posts (DoP) for an end-to-end IT modernisation programme. The partnership was aimed at equipping India Post with modern technologies and systems to enable it to offer more services to the customers in an effective manner.
 “At the heart of this transformation is the Core System Integration (CSI) program designed and implemented by TCS. This involved deploying an integrated ERP solution that caters to mail operations, finance and accounting, and HR functions, and connects its vast network of more than 1.5 lakh post offices, making this the largest distributed e-postal network in the world,” TCS said in a statement.
 The integrated solution supports requirements of over five lakh employees, services over 40,000 concurrent users, and processes over three million postal transactions a day, making this one of the largest SAP implementations globally, it added. On the front-end, TCS said, it has implemented its Point of Sale (PoS) solution across 24,000 post offices with over 80,000 PoS terminals and has also built a web portal with consignment tracking capabilities, and set up a multi-lingual call centre for customer support.
 “An important objective of the transformation is to use the department’s nation-wide reach to drive financial inclusion and accessibility of citizen services in remote areas. “This is being accomplished through over 1.3 lakh DARPAN 1 hand-held devices that Gramin Dak Sevaks use to provide postal, banking, insurance, and cash management services in remote villages, even those without network connectivity,” TCS said.
 TCS Business Group Head (Public Services) Debashis Ghosh said postal services across the world are reinventing themselves to stay relevant to a new generation in the digital era. “We are proud to have partnered with the Department of Posts in this pioneering, mission mode initiative to build a world class, future-ready digital platform that the nation can be proud of. With this, the department can offer smart postal services, enriched customer experiences, and innovative value-added services to the citizens of India,” he added."
53,2019-04-30,TCS,"‘Theft’ case may leave Brand TCS bruised
Tata Consultancy Services is facing yet another lawsuit in the US, this time for allegedly stealing trade secrets that could severely dent the firm’s image in its largest market. 
Last week, Computer Sciences Corp (CSC), a former client of TCS, alleged in a lawsuit that TCS America has been stealing its trade secrets.
In its filing with the US District Court of Northen District of Texas-Dallas Division, CSC has claimed that TCS is using its trade secrets to build a competing software platform, as part of TCS BaNCS, in the life insurance market.
“Defendants (TCS) are unfairly competing with CSC in the US in the life insurance and annuities administration and processing market. Rather than invest the substantial time and resources to compete legitimately and develop the complex software system required to administer and market US policies, the defendants are accessing and using CSC’s software source code and documentation, and its confidential, proprietary and trade secret information to do so,” said CSC in a preliminary statement filed with the court.
“Unless TCS is stopped from proceeding with these unjust efforts, they will be able to develop and launch a life insurance and annuities platform that is based on business and software solutions brazenly stolen from CSC,” noted CSC in the statement. 
Reacting to the development, a TCS spokesperson said: “TCS is aware of CSC’s court filing. Our legal team is reviewing the allegations and will respond appropriately. TCS BaNCS is a comprehensive product, with several successful implementations globally. TCS will strongly defend its position before the court.”
TCS faced a similar lawsuit five years ago, from software firm Epic Systems. TCS was asked to pay Epic $940 million, which was later reduced to $440 million. TCS is still contesting the claims. 
“IT firms need to be at an arm’s length from their software divisions, and create a separate legal entity for them. Not only does the software unit require to be a separate legal entity, but the company should also ensure that the employees and management are totally independent. Unless, that happens, such allegations cannot be ruled out,” said Sanchit Gogia, CEO of Greyhound Research.
Industry watchers said that in the short term, those opposed to the outsourcing model could use the TCS case to make a case for captive expansion, rather than using third-party vendors. But in the long term, discerning clients can always see through the case. The noise levels would be higher than the actual impact. 
“Overall, this will have some impact on the Indian IT industry, as many IT service providers are developing their own products and platforms. It will raise IP concerns in the minds of customers with competing products,” said Pareekh Jain, CEO at Pareekh Consulting. 
The lawsuit has been filed against TCS America. CSC had licensed its software to its customer Money Services Inc (MSI) in 1994. In 2014, MSI onboarded TCS to manage IT services. 
MSI is now owned by Transamerica, with whom TCS announced a $2-billion third party administration deal in 2018. TCS also rebadged 2,200 Transamerica employees post the deal. CSC claims that the current employees who had access to the CSC code were involved in the breach."

Top Indian IT services companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Cognizant and Infosys — have significantly increased their net employee additions during the March quarter, compared to the same period last year.
Wipro, however, bucked the trend with a contraction.
 










 
The improved hiring is in the backdrop of anticipated business growth and higher attrition rate — in the range of 10-20 per cent .
TCS led the pack in hiring, followed by Cognizant and Infosys.
“To support our growth, we continue to tap into talent pools across the world and add to our ranks. During this quarter, we added 6,356 employees on a net basis, bringing the total net addition for the year to 29,287. Our focus on diversity and inclusiveness continues to yield results,” V Ramakrishnan, CFO, TCS, had told analysts.
Salil Parekh, CEO and MD, Infosys, had said : “I think the overall demand environment is strong and therefore, the talent availability is constrained across the board, especially in the US. We have been able to fulfil the demand through fairly aggressive recruitment.” Over 50,000 new hires join the company in fiscal 2019, he had told analysts.
“We ramped up hiring in fourth quarter — and then in the beginning of March quarter — for the anticipated growth this year. It is hard to pull down the hiring. But once you have people on board you need the revenue to provide support,” Karen McLouhglin, CFO, Cognizant Technology Solutions, told analysts."

Responding to Computer Sciences Corp’s (CSC) trade secrets lawsuit against it, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)has said that the US-based firm was attempting to “disrupt” its deal with insurer Transamerica. The deal, signed in January 2018, is worth $2 billion. 
At the heart of the issue is Vantage, an insurance product from CSC, which claims that the software source code for Vantage was used by TCS to build its own insurance product. CSC had licensed Vantage to Transamerica, with the insurer's employees having access to the software's code to operate the system.
“Likely upset about Transamerica’s decision to transition from Vantage to TCS’s BaNCS Platform, CSC appears determined to disrupt the legitimate business relationship between Transamerica and TCS,” said TCS in a filing with US District Court of the Northern District of Texas.
As a part of TCS’s January, 2018 agreement with Transamerica, TCS hired about 2,000 people who were formerly employed by Transamerica in the US.
According to TCS, CSC was aware that “re-badged” employees of TCS would have access to CSC information and would use that information for the benefit of Transamerica.
“CSC was fully aware that TCS employees on the Transamerica Vantage Team had to routinely access and consult Vantage source code to support Transamerica’s ongoing needs. CSC’s employees participated in this conduct and shared the source code on emails with the Transamerica,” TCS said in a filing, a copy of which is seen by BusinessLine.
In a February/March 2019 email chain, TCS claimed, CSC employee Ashish Barnwal himself forwarded the Vantage software code to TCS and Transamerica employees to resolve an issue related to how certain calculations were performed, in order to inform Transamerica employees about implementation of BaNCS Platform. 
“Defendants (TCS) are unfairly competing with CSC in the life insurance and annuities administration and processing market. Rather than invest the substantial time and resources to compete legitimately and develop the complex software system required to administer and market US policies, defendants are accessing CSC’s confidential and trade secret information to do so,” said CSC in a filing with the US District Court of the Northern District of Texas.
TCS claimed that the email chain presented as evidence of misappropriation by CSC is simply a routine request from Transamerica to the Transamerica Vantage Team requesting support services for the Vantage Platform.
“CSC demonstrates that a limited group of people at TCS (the Transamerica Vantage Team) accessed allegedly proprietary CSC information — which is the same access they had as Transamerica employees — and that such information was used for the benefit of Transamerica, which Plaintiff has admitted is permitted,” they said.
“TCS has never used CSC’s proprietary data for TCS’s own benefit and certainly has not used any such information to develop a competing product. The team of software developers responsible for updating and customising TCS’s existing BaNCS Platform to provide functionalities as requested by its customers, including Transamerica, is located in Kolkata. This team has never had access to or used CSC’s proprietary data to develop its system,” said TCS’ memo to the US court."

 TCS has signed a new strategic partnership with Scandinavia’s leading airline, SAS, the flag-carrier of Sweden, Norway and Denmark.
The long-term partnership, which started in 2012, included an always-on IT platform and a digital e-commerce platform. TCS also worked with SAS’ Innovation Lab to deliver quality customer service across innovative channels, such as Turi, a new artificial intelligence (AI) -powered personal travel agent chatbot.
SAS’ new partnership with TCS will help provide an improved experience for SAS’ customers. At the same time, the technology platforms TCS will develop with SAS, will help the business to grow and transform effectively.

N Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Group. Pic: Debasish Bhaduri


 Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran on Thursday said there has been some improvement when it comes to group companies working together, but there is both the need as well as the room for more collaboration between them.
Addressing the annual general meeting of TCS, Chandrasekaran said group companies work at an arm’s length and there is full transparency, but exhorted the need to work together more.
 “We have seen some improvements, but we need to improve a lot more,” Chandrasekaran said.
It can be noted that since taking over in February 2017, Chandrasekaran has embarked on a strategy for increased integrations between group companies, which includes getting companies from a particular vertical together such as defence, and also merging companies--as he did with Tata Chemicals and Tata Global Beverages.
 The $ 100-billion plus group is working on a comprehensive plan to get down its water usage and carbon footprint, he said.
 Chandrasekaran, a career TCSian who rose to the top of the group, said there is a case for senior employees at the largest software exporter to be paid more.
Replying to shareholders’ queries on a rise in the number of employees drawing a salary of Rs 1 crore and above, he said the staff cost is only 53 per cent of the revenue, which is very low compared to the peers.
 To a specific query on his brother and TCS chief operating officer N Ganapathy Subramaniam getting an extension, he said all the related party decisions are done at the appropriate fora.
 He said while TCS has a retirement age, the presence of extraordinary skillsets essential to negotiate the market landscape has resulted in 10-15 employees like Ritu Anand and Barindra Sanyal and others getting extensions.
 Chandrasekaran said while TCS has adequate women representation on the board and also 36 per cent of the over 4 lakh employees are from the fairer sex, there is a need for more diversity among the management team.
The company has thousands of patents, but those are largely to claim rights over new technologies such that they can be deployed for customers, he said, adding TCS is not looking at licensing the patents now.
 He said it is the shift to digital which is at the core of driving the business and that the company has invested in retraining all employees in the past few years.
 “We are seeing beginning of a new cycle, demand environment will be strong. TCS is in for a multi-year cycle, help customers and grow its revenue,” he said.
TCS managing director and chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan said digital revenue has been growing at 50 per cent annually and constituted over $6 billion of the overall $20 billion revenue in FY19.
 He said the company was able to close new deals of over $21.9 billion in the last fiscal.
 On the demand situation, he said it continues to be robust structurally but there are “lingering issues” on various fronts like Brexit or trade wars, and added that technological investments are high.
 There is volatility in deal pipeline, but the overall trend is strong, he said.
On the massive rise donations to political parties, by the Tata Trusts in the just concluded hustings, he said all the group firms contribute for the trusts ahead of an election every five years and the combined pool is split between political parties as per their strength in the Lok Sabha.
 It can be noted that the Tatas gave around Rs 600 crore in political funding in the 2019 hustings, which is over 20 times of what it had given for the 2014 polls. Of this, as much as Rs 220 crore was contributed by TCS.
 The company expects the new finance minister to present a growth-oriented budget and re-ignite the digital India initiative with investments in technology, he said."

Old Mahabalipuram Road in Chennai houses a large number of IT companies with an estimated four lakh employees, apart from the local population
   -  Dhiraj Singh


 IT companies in Chennai have long had a policy centred around BYOD (bring your own device — such as laptops). Now, in response to a severe water crisis that has the city and its suburbs in its grip, the companies have embraced a BYOP policy for those bringing food from home. That’s Bring Your Own (Disposable) Plates.
A software engineer working with a large IT company in Sholinganallur said that until last week, employees were provided with plates to eat. However, due to water scarcity, the supply of plates was stopped. 
Instead of keeping multiple use-and-throw paper cups at each water station, there is just one reusable cup, which is kept chained, he said.
The IT Corridor along Old Mahabalipuram Road houses a large number of IT companies with an estimated four lakh employees, apart from the local population. However, this stretch faces a severe water shortage, with protests reported every day demanding water supply.
In the total absence of piped water supply, large IT campuses and companies in big IT parks have set up water-recycling plants and arranged for supply from private tankers. However, smaller companies are at the mercy of Chennai Metrowater and private tankers, which are expensive, industry officials said.
Companies such as Tata Consultancy Services and Cognizant Technology Solutions have water treatment plants at their campuses at Siruseri IT park. In fact, TCS has a large pond within the campus that serves as a good reservoir. “We don’t have any water problem,” said a TCS official.
Cognizant has adopted innovative water-saving methods by installing special nozzles into washbasin taps; these nozzles reduce the water flow to a mist by atomising the water into fine droplets, bringing down water consumption by 80 per cent and preventing wastage, said a company spokesperson.
The company has switched over to biodegradable plates in all its cafeterias, temporarily closed the shower facilities at its gyms, and minimised the washing of utensils in campuses by cafeteria vendors. 
Due to these measures, the company has been able to further optimise water consumption. Cognizant has also created an online forum for employees to share ideas and best practices around water conservation, he said.
Nagaraj Mylandla, Founder and Managing Director of Financial Software and Systems, located at the Siruseri IT Park, said the company gets water supply from SIPCOT central services and from private water tankers, and uses recycled water for toilets. 
None of the companies to whom BusinessLine spoke have asked their employees to work from home due to water shortage.
An official of an industry association said that having all the companies located in a single location like OMR will accentuate the water shortage. “Companies need to spread their wings across the State to avoid such problems,” he said.
Chennai’s total water requirement is 830 MLD (millions liters per day). Chennai Metrowater currently supplies about 525 MLD through various sources such as groundwater, lakes/reservoirs) and desalination plants. This leaves a supply deficit of around 300 MLD every day. 
Water supply to South Chennai, where OMR is located, is met through Veeranam lake and Nemmeli Seawater Desalination Plant, said a senior Chennai Metrowater official."

Tata Consultancy Services on Tuesday reported 10.8 per cent growth in consolidated net profit to ₹8,131 crore for the quarter-ended June 30 from ₹7,340 crore in the year-ago period.
Revenue of the Tata group company grew 11.4 per cent to ₹38,172 crore in the June quarter, compared to ₹34,261 crore in the year-ago quarter.
Digital revenue accounted for 32.2 per cent of the topline, growing 42.1 per cent in the said quarter. BFSI, the largest vertical for TCS, grew 9.2 per cent year-on-year.
“We have had a steady start to the new fiscal year. We see customers continuing to spend on their growth and transformation initiatives, and that is showing in our strong order book and deal pipeline this quarter,” TCS CEO and MD Rajesh Gopinathan said.
However, operating margin saw a 90 basis point drop at 24.2 per cent against 25.1 per cent in March quarter and 25 per cent in the same quarter last year. Net margin for the quarter was 21.3 per cent. The company said the drop in margins was mostly due to the strengthening of the rupee.
While increased scrutiny on H1B visas has pushed up salary bills for most IT services companies, who are forced to increase their hiring in the US, TCS declined to give details of the cost impact of its hiring in the US nor the number of people it has employed in the US. The company, however, said that it was one of the biggest employers in the US, pointing out that hiring in the US has not had a major impact on the company’s financials.
Overall, TCS said it had issued joining letters to over 30,000 fresh graduates and about 40 per cent of them have been on-boarded in June quarter while the rest are expected to join by September. The company had a net employee addition of 12,356 — the highest in five years — taking the total headcount to 4,36,641.
Among geographies, growth was led by the UK (up 16 per cent), India 15.9 per cent) and Europe (15 per cent). Other markets, too, showed good momentum: North America (up 7.7 per cent), Asia Pacific (9.5 per cent), MEA (6.4 per cent) and Latin America (6.4 per cent).
The earnings per share (EPS) stood at ₹21.67, up 13 per cent year-on-year. The board has recommended a dividend of ₹5 per equity share for the June quarter.
“Our margins this quarter fully reflect the annual increments that we effected across the board in April. Sustained rigour in operations helped deliver strong cash conversion and EPS expansion,” TCS CFO V Ramakrishnan said."

 TCS iON, a unit of IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), on Wednesday said it has partnered with All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to provide students with a digital learning course to equip them with career skills.
TCS iON has curated a free, 20 hour-career skills course that will cover topics like corporate etiquette, effective e-mail writing, impactful presentations and IT awareness that will be available to students throughout the duration of their degree course.
The course, which will be available for students of more than 10,000 AICTE approved institutions, can be accessed on TCS iON Digital Learning Hub through any device.
“We are one of the largest recruiters of engineering graduates in the country. We have noticed that there is a gap in students’ competencies in terms of career skills. While students may have strong academic performance, the lack of basic soft skills such as effective communication and interpersonal skills may result in these students missing out on job opportunities,” TCS iON Global Head Venguswamy Ramaswamy said.
Through the partnership, TCS, together with educational institutions, intends to help students develop better career skills, he added.
Ramaswamy said the company had last year selected 63,000 students from over 2.8 lakh applicants through its National Qualifier Test, but could extend offer letters to only about 30,000. Many of those not selected lacked these career skills.
“With this programme, we want to enhance the quality of talent pool. It is not only for us but will help the industry at large,” he said.
AICTE Chairman Anil D Sahasrabudhe said the course will empower students with career skills to help them stand out in the competitive hiring scenario.
“The unique course will help improve placement opportunities for our institutions, thereby initiating a strong start to the professional careers of the students. The guidance provided by TCS iON will prepare students for their professional endeavours and help cultivate a highly qualified, competent, and proficient workforce,” he said.
AICTE is the national-level apex advisory and regulatory body for technical education."

 “TCS’ Q1 FY20 result was a tad below estimates on both revenue growth and margins.

35,2019-07-10,TCS,"Will focus on cost management, efficiency: TCS CEO


After achieving a double-digit growth in the first quarter, IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) wants to reflect on internal processes and ensure its investments are returning value. In a conversation with BusinessLine, TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan talked about how he is taking a strategic call to divide management focus and work on improving efficiencies. Excerpts:
Your growth in BFSI and North America has slowed. What are the challenges that you’re facing? 
There is moderation on the capital markets side. People are uncertain about how it is going. We had called it out last quarter. That softness is actually increased during the quarter. A lot of impact in North America is coming from BFSI and retail. Manufacturing is doing very well for us in North America. Overall, I would say there is weakness volatility in the environment. We hope retail will bounce back next quarter. We’ll wait and watch BFSI.
You’ve talked about focussing on stability instead of growth. Why? 
It’s not that we are not pushing for growth. In the last couple of years, we were completely focussed on getting to double-digit growth to capture the opportunity as well as to address credibility issues. We made big strategic calls that were counter-intuitive to the industry. That credibility has been established. Now, we need to step back and look at the efficiency paradigm. Our customers are faced to work on demand, efficiency and growth altogether. We will also focus on cost management part.
Earlier, we were leveraging investments for growth, now we’ll see whether the productivity benefits are coming through from our investments. 
To me double-digit was a milestone. I’m not interested in pushing that up. Our strategic agenda is now broader. 
When Digitate was set up, TCS said it had the opportunity to be a $2-billion business. How is it living up to that expectation?
Let’s take the first product they’ve launched — Ignio has already crossed $60 million in revenue. It is the fastest growing software product in that category. It will be a meaningful part of TCS portfolio but it will take time. 
Digitate has been set up as a separate entity. They act independently, but are strongly linked to TCS. We have worked for a Canadian retailer who was not a customer of TCS. Ignio worked with them independently as product vendor. We hardly have any services business with them but Digitate is at the front lines without the dependency on TCS. Two of our competitors are service providers and we are, in fact, training their people to use the product. 
On the flip side, we have set up our intelligent enterprise automation group, which works with Digitate and other vendors across a spectrum of automation tools. 
Last year, TCS talked about plans to bifurcate digital revenues into specific technologies such as cloud, cyber security etc. When can we expect to see that?
It is a long standing demand. Given the level of flux, we are not yet ready to talk about it. Coming out with numbers every 13 weeks itself is a burden. Disaggregating it further, I want to keep on doing it to a level where it is value adding for us also. 
There is a lot of pressure on margins. You’ve mentioned impact from rupee and cost related to hiring, is it that or there’s more to shrinking margins?
If you don’t innovate, you lose price resiliency. Constant innovation and investment gets reflected in the ability to hold prices and your competitive position. That’s reflected in our best-in-class industry margins in an industry that has been struggling to maintain growth and margins. By our historical trends, margins are slightly lower, impacted by external events such as currency and political events.
Do you think investing internally as against acquiring companies has worked for TCS?
To me, it is always better to fund from P&L than from the balance sheet. We are very disciplined not to use our balance sheet. We have been systematic about it. 
 Digitate and Ignio are works in progress. The fact that it is homegrown, has given us the confidence to constantly change."

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Friday launched the Advanced Drug Development (ADD) Site Feasibility Platform, which provides life sciences companies with a single, integrated platform.
The platform digitises the site selection and activation processes, and facilitates data-driven decision-making while assessing site feasibility for multi-site clinical trials.
When planning a clinical study, the following aspects have an impact on the outcomes:
1. Selection of the right sites for the clinical trials
2. Patient population
3. Investigator profiles
4. Treatment facilities and other parametres
Yet, this critical activity was done manually, resulting in sub-optimal site choices that can result in significant delays and costs.
In a statement, TCS said that its Site Feasibility Platform addresses this critical problem currently faced by life sciences companies by leveraging the power of digital technologies to drive superior clinical outcomes.
The new platform consolidates data currently residing on multiple systems within the enterprise into a central knowledge repository from which it derives insights that can be used to identify the sites best suited for a given study protocol, with the most appropriate patient population and investigators.
It digitises and automates the entire assessment and selection process, enabling the efficient and coordinated management of hundreds of concurrent clinical trial feasibility studies.
Moreover, the platform is fully integrated with the TCS Connected Clinical Trials e-Survey Platform, providing customers with an end-to-end solution for conducting site surveys and analyzing the survey responses.
TCS said a leading life sciences company is the first customer to go live with its ADD Site Feasibility Platform.
“We are leveraging our deep knowledge of the life sciences industry to continually expand the capabilities of the TCS ADD suite of cloud platforms. The Site Feasibility platform will help our customers digitally transform the most critical study design aspects of their clinical trials and drive superior outcomes,” said Debashis Ghosh, President, Life Sciences and Healthcare, TCS."

27,2019-08-10,TCS,"Weekly Trading Guide 
SBI (₹291.3)
SBI continued the fall for the fifth consecutive week. The stock tumbled 5.5 per cent last week. With this fall, the stock has plummeted 21.4 per cent over the last five weeks. On the charts, there is room for the fall to extend further in the coming days. The levels of ₹304 and ₹307 are the key near-term resistances which can cap the upside. There is possibility of a sideways consolidation between ₹285 and ₹307 (200-day moving average) in the near term. But a strong rise past ₹307 looks less likely now as the broader bias continues to remain negative. As such, SBI is likely to decline eventually below ₹285 and extend the current downtrend to ₹275-273 or even ₹269. The broad region between ₹275 and ₹269 is a strong support zone, which can halt the current fall. A corrective rally to ₹290-300 is possible from this support zone on short-covering. But if SBI declines below ₹269, it will come under more pressure. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹245-240 or even ₹230.










ITC (₹254.2)
ITC fell about 4 per cent last week breaking below the support level of ₹263 (200-week moving average) as expected. The downtrend remains intact. However, ITC is coming closer to an intermediate support level of ₹250. If it manages to bounce from this support, a corrective up-move to ₹260 or ₹265 is possible. ITC may, thus, remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. However, a strong rally beyond ₹265 looks unlikely. An eventual break below ₹250 will see the stock resuming the downtrend to ₹240 — possibly the last leg of move in the current downtrend. The level of ₹240 is a strong long-term trend support, which can halt the current downtrend. A strong bounce from ₹240 can take the stock up to ₹260-265. There is possibility of the stock forming a base by consolidating between ₹240 and ₹265. A decisive break above ₹265 can start a fresh rally, targeting ₹290-300 over the medium term. But if ITC declines below ₹240, the fall can extend to ₹230-228 band.










Infosys (₹790.1)
Infosys has remained stuck between ₹755 and ₹805 over the last four weeks. Within this range, the stock rose about 2 per cent last week. The near-term outlook continues to remain unclear. The up-move in the past week looks weak. This reduces the possibility l of the stock breaking above ₹805 — the upper end of the range at the moment. The stock can reverse lower again towards ₹765 and ₹755 and maintain the sideways move t for some more time. A breakout on either side of ₹755 or ₹805 will determine the direction of the next move. If Infosys manages to break above ₹805, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break will indicate the resumption of the broader uptrend. It will then take the stock up to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if Infosys breaks the range below ₹755, it can come under pressure. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹740. A further break below ₹740 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending towards ₹715 and ₹700 on profit-booking.










RIL (₹1,162.0)
RIL tumbled over 7 per cent intra-week to a low of ₹1,095.65. However, the stock has managed to claw-back sharply from the low. But this bounce-back is just a short-covering rally which may not last long. A further rise to test the immediate resistance level of ₹1,190 is possible in the near term. A break above ₹1,190 will extend the corrective rally to ₹1,220. However, a further rise past ₹1,220 is less likely as fresh sellers can emerge at higher levels. Also, the indicators on the charts are bearish. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average. This is a bearish signal, indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, RIL is likely to reverse lower either from ₹1,190 or ₹1,220. It will then take the stock lower to ₹1,100-1,090 levels again. Inability to break below ₹1,090 can keep the stock sideways between ₹1,090 and ₹1,220 for some time. But the bias will continue to remain negative and RIL is likely to decline below ₹1,090 eventually. Such a break will then drag the stock lower to ₹1,050 and ₹1,030










Tata Steel (₹362.3)
Tata Steel is on a free fall and has declined to ₹360 as expected. The stock tumbled 11.4 per cent last week. Tata Steel has plummeted over 28 per cent in the last six weeks. An immediate support is at ₹358. If Tata Steel manages to bounce from this support, a corrective rally to ₹385 or ₹400 is possible on short-covering. A rise past ₹400 is unlikely now as fresh sellers can emerge at higher levels and keep the broader downtrend intact. As such, an eventual break below ₹358 will see the current fall extending to ₹330 and ₹325. As cautioned last week, from a long-term perspective, the current downtrend which had begun in 2018 is looking strong. This downtrend may have the potential to drag Tata Steel to ₹250-230. An intermediate halt and a corrective bounce is possible from the ₹310-300 support zone before the targets of ₹250-230 are achieved.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and GM on Monday announced that TCS will acquire certain assets at the GM Technical Center – India (GMTC-I) that could help it boost its automotive engineering capabilities.
Tata Sons’ most profitable firm, TCS already works with several major automotive companies in areas such as connected vehicles, autonomous driving technologies and vehicle analytics system.
The acquisition of the GMTC-I in Bengaluru will also include the two companies’ partnership, wherein TCS will support its global vehicle programmes with engineering design services over the next five years.
The deal includes over 1,300 employees of GMTC-I being transferred to TCS, including teams focussed on propulsion systems, vehicle engineering, controls development, testing, creative design and special projects.
TCS has been working for GM on various projects for the past 16 years.
GM Vice-President electrification, controls, software & electronics, Dan Nicholson said, “We are pleased to evolve our partnership even further, as we work to deliver on our commitment to create a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.”
“TCS is excited to be part of GM’s efforts in next generation mobility, helping them design and engineer world class vehicles that set new benchmarks in driving experience, safety and emissions,” said Regu Ayyaswamy, Global Head, Engineering and Industrial Services Practice, TCS.
“Next generation automotive R&D is a key focus area for TCS, given the criticality of product innovation and connectedness in the Business 4.0 world. This new partnership with General Motors is a testament to our willingness to invest in the relationship for the longer term,” said Susheel Vasudevan, Global Head, Manufacturing Business Group, TCS.

This partnership will make both companies stronger: GM will benefit from the scale and cross-sectoral knowledge of TCS, while TCS will benefit from the influx of world-class engineering talent.”
The transaction and handover are expected to be completed by the end of September."
25,2019-09-23,TCS,"Corporate tax cuts: Stocks that gain the most
Earnings growth for India Inc, which has been on first gear in recent times, is all set to receive a boost from lower tax outgo, with the reduced corporate tax rates. For many manufacturing companies, the savings on this front could give them room to reduce prices or improve other spends, thereby spurring demand. Many companies in sectors such as infrastructure, capital goods and FMCG stand to gain. Some others in the auto, steel, oil and gas, and real-estate segments could also get a leg-up. IT companies may be better off under the current regime though, given the lower tax incidence at present.
Most companies in the information technology space will not be enthused by the corporate tax rate cuts announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. There are two reasons. Many companies have an effective corporate tax rate below 25.17 per cent (including surcharge and cess) and they get the benefit of profit-based deductions for exporting their services from special economic zones in India.
Also, IT and software companies that build their own intellectual property get a weighted deduction under the income-tax laws on the R&D expenses that they have incurred to build their IP.
Now, such companies might have to pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) calculated on their book profits.
The Finance Minister has slashed MAT from 18.5 per cent to 15 per cent. That puts the effective tax rate, including surcharge, for companies paying MAT at 17.5 per cent compared with 21.6 per cent earlier.
This means that IT companies that get tax deductions on their export revenues earned from operating in SEZs, and pay MAT, wouldn’t want to opt out of claiming these deductions. They would also have to forego the weighted deduction on R&D that brings down the effective corporate tax rate.
Besides, if they opt for the lower effective corporate tax rate of 25.2 per cent, they will have to take a one-time charge of any MAT credit that might be in their books.
In 2018-19, out of the top-tier IT companies in the S&P BSE IT Index, only Infosys (26 per cent) had an effective tax rate of over 25 per cent at the standalone level, while TCS (21.3 per cent), HCL Technologies (23.7 per cent), Wipro (23.02 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (19.6 per cent) had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
Even most mid-tier IT companies such as Mphasis (20.5 per cent), Hexaware (22.3 per cent), Mindtree (24.9 per cent), L&T Infotech (21.7 per cent) and L&T Technology Services (24.2 per cent), had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
In all, IT companies won’t be rushing to opt out of their export-based tax incentives until the benefit of paying lower taxes on export revenues runs out.
With major players such as Hindustan Unilever, Nestle, Britannia, GSK Consumer and Colgate-Palmolive suffering an effective tax of 32-36 per cent, the FMCG segment could be a beneficiary of the new 25.17 per cent tax rate.
At the same time, home-grown companies such as Dabur, Jyothy Labs, Godrej Consumer, Bajaj Consumer and Marico may not choose to move to the new regime, considering that their effective tax rates are either on a par with or lower than 25.17 per cent.
Overall, for shareholders in FMCG stocks, this move could result in the 2018-19 profits of listed FMCG players, on an aggregate, inching up by 9 per cent.
However, FMCG companies can choose to retain a portion of the benefits to increase advertising spends and/or pass it on as price cuts to boost demand. In the quarter-ended June 2019, for instance, major FMCG companies clocked single-digit growth in sales due to poor volumes.
Going by the 2018-19 numbers, Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motors and Maruti Suzuki and Eicher Motors have an effective tax rate of 29-33 per cent and could benefit from the reduced rates. However, the rates of Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland, are much lower. Taking M&M ‘s reported tax expenses (standalone) for 2018-19, the effective tax rate is only at 24.17 per cent (21.3 per cent, considering the current year's tax expense alone).
The company also has a MAT credit of ₹1,116.35 crore in its books as on March 31, 2019. Ashok Leyland’s effective tax rate, given the reported tax expense for 2018-19, is 20.6 per cent (15.14 per cent taking the current year's expense alone). The company has availed itself of benefit to the extent of ₹233 crore on tax concessions and tax holidays in 2018-19 and has MAT credit on its books.
In such cases, companies may choose to continue under the current regime till the tax holiday/concessions exist. Since MAT also continues at a reduced rate of 15 per cent, these companies can choose to pay tax as per normal rates or as per MAT, whichever is higher — as has been the case until now. MAT credit can also be set off against the tax liability in future years.
Among auto ancillaries, MNC players such as SKF India, Goodyear and Bosch that have high effective tax rates of 33-36 per cent could be major beneficiaries. Put together, listed companies in the auto and auto ancillaries space may see a 3-5 per cent addition to their profits of 2018-19, if they choose to avail themselves of the 25.17 per cent tax rate.
For infrastructure companies, the effective tax rates in FY19, after taking into account all eligible exemptions and tax holidays, work out to 27-35 per cent of their standalone PBT. For companies such as Engineers India, Ircon International, Ashoka Buildcon and RITES, availing themselves of the lower tax rate of 25.17 per cent could translate to a 14-18 per cent jump in earnings, going forward. Whereas, giants such as Larsen & Toubro and IRB Infra developers could witness only a 2 and 5 per cent rise in PAT led by tax savings.
Among the pure construction players, NCC, Welspun and Sadhbav Engg could benefit. Certain companies have effective tax rates of less than 25 per cent, which can be on account of payment of minimum alternate tax, or availing themselves of benefits of differential depreciation on fixed assets under the IT Act. The effects of the amendments announced will hence have to be evaluated on a case-to-case basis.
For instance, Dilip Buildcon has an effective tax rate of 16 per cent in FY19 on account of MAT provisions (inferred from the annual report). Hence, the lowered MAT rates could bring down its effective tax rate further, and the company would also get the existing MAT credit entitlement.
On the other hand, Adani Port and SEZ now enjoy an effective tax rate of 21 per cent, after availing itself of deductions under Section 80IAB of the Income Tax Act for 10 years, with effect from FY07-08. This apart, it has several subsidiaries and joint ventures that can get tax holiday benefits under Section 80IA.
The company is also likely to benefit from the grandfathering of taxes on buyback, as the management had made a public announcement of the share buyback of ₹1,960 crore on June 4, 2019.
Among the cement manufacturers, the effective tax rate in FY19 for most companies (on a standalone basis) is less than 25 per cent — they may refrain from foregoing their exemptions and deductions. This includes large players like Ultratech and Shree Cement. However, there could be savings in PAT in the range of 11-15 per cent for Himadri, Deccan and India Cements if they opt for the subsidised rates, as their current effective tax rate is more than 25.17 per cent.
The impact of the lower corporate tax on the steel industry is expected to be mixed, at least in the near future.
The tax incidence on companies such as Tata Steel, Kalyani Steels and Jindal Stainless Hisar in FY19 was 39 per cent, 33 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively. Note that these are the tax rates after taking into account the tax exemptions that the companies are eligible for. Thus, these companies stand to gain in a big way if they opt for the reduced tax rate of 22 per cent (25.17 per cent including surcharge and cess).
Companies such as JSW Steel and Tata Metaliks with effective tax rates of 20 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, may not opt for the reduced tax rate immediately. Meanwhile, SAIL, Jindal Steel and Uttam Galva had zero current tax for FY19. This could be either due to companies making losses in FY19 or accumulated losses from previous years, setting off the year’s profits. If the new reduced tax rate is opted, setting-off of losses will not be possible, making it unattractive. However, in the long run, when the companies turn profitable or become eligible to pay MAT, they can opt for the new tax rates, which could reduce their tax outgo.
The move to reduce corporate tax seems largely positive for real-estate companies reeling under pressure due to tight liquidity in the market. For most realty companies, the effective tax rate is higher than 25.17 per cent (including cess and surcharge), based on standalone profit before tax. For instance, for Oberoi Realty and Ashiana Housing, the current tax rate is 29 per cent, while for Kolte-Patil, it works out to around 45 per cent.
These companies, if they adopt the new corporate tax regime, could improve their earnings, even if they forego their exemptions and MAT credit.
If players pass on the benefit to home buyers, it could spur demand in the market.
But for companies such as Sunteck Realty and Prestige Estate Properties, for which the effective current year tax rates work out to less than 5 per cent, and Brigade Enterprises and Sobha with 23 per cent rate, continuing with the existing tax structure may be better.
For the oil and gas sector, the cut in corporate tax rate seems largely positive. Going by their FY19 standalone financials, the effective tax rate for most companies in the sector is higher than the 25.17 per cent rate (including surcharge and cess) that will apply to them now. For instance, in FY19, the current tax provision of city gas distributors Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas was about 31 per cent of their profit before tax.
The effective tax rate for the PSU hydrocarbon explorers, ONGC and Oil India, and gas transmitter GAIL (India) was 27-28 per cent, while it was about 29 per cent for PSU refiner HPCL. The highest tax rate — about 32 per cent — was borne by Gujarat-based gas transmitter GSPL. For the above companies, the new tax rate of 22 per cent plus surcharge of 10 per cent and cess of 4 per cent — totalling 25.17 per cent — should translate into lower tax outgo. Even if these companies have to give up some investment-based tax exemptions and credit of minimum alternate tax carried forward from earlier years, they should be better off under the new tax rate regime.
On the other hand, there are a few companies such as Reliance Industries, PSU refiners Indian Oil and BPCL, and gas importer Petronet LNG that may not benefit from the new tax rate. In FY19, the current tax provision of Reliance Industries, Indian Oil and BPCL was about 20 per cent of their profit before tax — this is lower than the new effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
It is the same case for Petronet LNG, which had an effective tax rate of about 24 per cent last year. For these companies, it may be worthwhile continuing with their existing tax structure, taking the benefits, if any, of investment-based tax exemptions, and carried forward MAT credit and carried forward loss.
In the case of Reliance Industries, for instance, while the applicable tax rate in FY19 was 34.94 per cent, it was able to reduce the effective rate (excluding deferred tax adjustments) to about 20 per cent, thanks to exempted income, and additional allowances net of MAT credit.
The company may likely find it more beneficial to continue with this arrangement until the tax breaks that keep the effective tax low are exhausted.
Later, it could shift to the new regime with the effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman opened the liquidity tap for corporates on Friday by announcing a sharp tax cut and leaving more money in their hands for capacity expansion. The statutory tax rate for corporates has been lowered to 22 per cent from 30 per cent. This benefit, though, is only for companies that wish to give up their tax exemptions. Given that most tax incentives and exemptions have been phased out over the past few years, companies may prefer to forego the few they enjoy now, and opt to be taxed at the lower rate of 22 per cent.
New manufacturing companies incorporated after October 1, 2019, can benefit from an even lower rate of 15 per cent tax if they don’t claim the tax benefits they are eligible for. India Inc will also get relief on MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax). The Finance Minister has reduced MAT to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent. This would benefit companies located in SEZ developers, infrastructure, cement companies, companies with units in specified locations in the North-East and exporters. There is also relief on buyback tax.
The 20 per cent tax on buybacks by corporates, which was announced in the Budget on July 5, 2019, would not apply to companies that announced them before the Budget day. According to data from nseinfobase.com, companies, including Sasken Technologies, Greaves Cotton, Welspun Corp, Star Cement and Eris Lifesciences, whose issues are on the way, but were announced before July 5, and for companies such as Infosys, which had buybacks ongoing in July, will benefit from the change. Wipro is also set to benefit as it announced its buyback on June 5.
Companies that pay corporate taxes under the new rates of 15 and 22 per cent will be charged a flat surcharge of 10 per cent, irrespective of their taxable income. The companies that choose the existing regime, availing exemptions and deductions, will have to pay a surcharge only if their total income exceeds ₹1 crore. The rates of surcharge for them will continue to be at 7 per cent and 12 per cent, for total income between ₹1 crore and ₹10 crore and more than ₹10 crore, respectively.
The stock market on Friday cheered the Finance Minister’s move to cut taxes. While companies that are currently paying lower rates due to various deductions and exemptions, such as many information technology players, are unlikely to shift to the new regime, there are many companies across sectors that are likely to see their tax incidence move lower, thus translating to higher profits. If the lower tax incidence is passed on to customers in the form of price cuts, it can help spur demand.
 








 
Ever since the late Finance Minister Arun Jaitley kick-started the process of a phased reduction in corporate tax in 2016-17 and elimination of exemptions, the effective tax rate for India Inc has only gone up.
This is because, while smaller companies were given the benefit of a lower tax rate each year, the phasing out of some tax deductions began impacting the tax outgo of larger companies.
Further, in 2015-16, the Finance Minister also increased the surcharge on corporate tax. That year, for companies with income of up to ₹10 crore, the surcharge was increased to 7 per cent from 5 per cent, and for firms with income above ₹10 crore, it was increased to 12 per cent from 10 per cent. Thus, the effective tax rate in 2017-18 came to 29.49 per cent; it was 23.22 per cent in 2013-14. This increase — evident in the numbers of the past one year — was due to larger companies coughing up more.
In 2017-18, the effective tax rate for companies making profit of more than ₹500 crore was 26.3 per cent; in 2016-17, it was 23.94 per cent. The effective tax rate for smaller companies making profit of ₹1-10 crore came down to 27.38 per cent from 29.2 per cent. So far, withdrawal of tax exemptions has made the effective tax rate of larger companies move higher. It is from here on that these companies will start benefiting.
Now, all companies that are willing to give up their tax incentives can pay taxes at a fairly lower rate of 22 per cent.
 
India is now among the countries that have a low corporate tax rate, and can compete better globally. For the current year, KPMG data show that the statutory tax rate in Myanmar is 25 per cent; in Malaysia, it is 24 per cent; 25 per cent in Indonesia and Korea and 28 per cent in Sri Lanka. Even Chinese companies cough up more — as they pay a tax of 25 per cent — and in Brazil, it is 34 per cent.
The global average corporate tax rate is 23.79 now, and the Asian average is 21.09 per cent. That said, the current move to cut taxes is going to make a hole in the government’s tax kitty. Last year, as per the Budget estimates, the revenue foregone by the Centre on various tax incentives was ₹1.08-lakh crore. Now, with tax cuts, there will be an additional revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore.
 
Bond investors who have been basking in the double-digit return glory over the past year may be in for a bumpy ride ahead. While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s corporate tax rate cut has cheered India Inc and the equity market, the move is a dampener for bond markets.
This is because the revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore owing to the cut will throw the Centre’s fiscal deficit target off track. The RBI’s surplus transfer to the Centre, at best, makes up for the existing shortfall in income tax and GST collections. While higher proceeds from disinvestment and some tax buoyancy (towards the end of the fiscal), on account of the growth-boosting measures, can aid revenues, for now, the ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue loss appears to have left a big hole in the Centre’s kitty. The fiscal deficit target could well move up to 4 per cent (from the projected 3.3 per cent), implying additional borrowings.
Based on the Controller General of Accounts’ (CGA) provisional figures for FY19 (in which income tax grew by a modest 7 per cent), the estimated growth in income tax collections for FY20 works out to 23 per cent. For April-July, CGA data suggest that the growth in net income tax was just about 6 per cent. There is also a significant shortfall in GST collections.
The surplus transfer by the RBI as recommended by the Bimal Jalan Committee has offered a much-needed respite to the Centre in the current fiscal. Excluding the ₹28,000-crore interim dividend already paid by the RBI to the Centre last fiscal, the net transfer in the current financial year amounts to ₹1,48,051 crore. But while optically, the surplus transfer appears to be a massive figure, essentially, it is about ₹60,000 crore above what was estimated in the Budget. Hence, this additional bonanza can help make good the shortfall in tax revenues.
On the disinvestment front, the Centre has set a target of ₹1.05-lakh crore (above the ₹85,000 crore achieved the previous year), which may be achievable. But given that the Centre has been missing its target on spectrum, it is unlikely to meet its estimate of ₹50,500 crore for FY20.
On balance, before the corporate tax rate cut, the Centre could have still pulled off the 3.3 per cent (risk of missing GDP growth assumptions though remained). The substantial ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue foregone on account of the corporate tax rate cut is an additional burden for the Centre that can take its fiscal deficit target to 4 per cent levels.
The joker in the pack is still the underlying growth in the economy. While the real GDP growth has fallen from 8 per cent last year to 5 per cent this fiscal in the April-June quarter, the sharp fall in nominal GDP growth from 12.6 per cent to 8 per cent during this period is worrisome.
The Centre’s fiscal deficit target assumes a 11 per cent growth in nominal GDP growth for FY20 (from the Central Statistics Office’s FY19 estimates), which is a tall task. If growth falters further, the fiscal deficit target can even move beyond 4 per cent levels.
The biggest overhang for Indian bond markets has been the huge gross market borrowings by the Centre pegged at a high ₹7.1-lakh crore in the current fiscal (from ₹5.71-lakh crore last year). But given that the borrowing calendar has been front-loaded, the market was factoring in the easing of supply of bonds in the second half of the fiscal.
For the April-September 2019 period, issuance of government securities amounts to ₹4.42-lakh crore; the balance ₹2.68-lakh crore of gross borrowings will come in the second half. But the supply of bonds in the second half could go up now. The stimulus announced by the Centre would lead to additional borrowings, which implies more supply of bonds and higher yields (bond prices and yields are inversely related).
Going ahead with the foreign sovereign bond issuance could be a saving grace. The ₹70,000-odd crore of foreign sovereign bonds pegged in by most economists can help lower bond yields in the domestic market.
Even though the RBI cut its policy repo rate by a notable 35 basis points in its August policy, Indian bond yields have only inched up. From 6.3 per cent levels in the beginning of August, the yield on 10-year government bonds has increased to 6.6 per cent levels, already factoring in expectations of a fiscal stimulus from the Centre. Post the FM’s move on corporate tax rate, the yield has moved up by another 20 basis points.
Given that expectations of fiscal slippage has been factored into bond yields to some extent, bond yields could remain range-bound in the near term, until there is more clarity on foreign sovereign bond issuance, GST collections and the disinvestment agenda. Expectations of the RBI cutting rates further, given the sanguine inflation trends, may also cap the upside in bond yields. That said, notable rise in yields cannot be ruled out in the coming months, given the significant slip on fiscal deficit and volatile rupee.
Given the uncertainty around various factors impacting bond yields, investors must cap their expectations and tread with caution. Long-term gilt funds as a category has delivered 15-16 per cent returns over the past year, thanks to the sharp rise in bond prices. A rise in yield (fall in prices) hereon can impact returns.
Hence, investors should avoid duration and credit risk in their portfolio. A chunk of your debt fund investments should be in short-term debt funds that carry less volatility in returns. Short- and medium-duration debt funds having a duration of up to 3-4 years are ideal for investors with medium risk appetite. Opt for corporate bond funds that invest a chunk of their assets in high-rated debt instruments."

22,2019-10-01,TCS,"Q2 outlook: Infosys, TCS set to perform better 
Infosys and TCS are expected to put up a good performance during the second quarter results while Wipro might come out with weak revenue growth.
Analysts tracking the domestic IT sector said EBIT margin is expected to decline for all companies except Wipro on a year-on-year basis because of increase in US cost structure, investments to grow a digital business and transition costs in large deals.
In an interview with BusinessLine, Cognizant CEO, Brian Humphries said while the IT sector growth will remain robust in the coming years, most of the market is rapidly shifting to digital. “The overall numbers are changing and within those pillars, the traditional business is either flat to slightly declining while the digital business is growing 10 to 12 per cent,” Humphries said.

But analysts pointed out that the slowdown in BFS spending and client-specific challenges are soft spots. “Revenue growth will be mixed and driven by seasonal strength and client-specific challenges,” Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to its investors said.
Kotak said it forecasts 3.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth for Infosys with 60 basis points contribution from Stater acquisition. It said strong revenue growth in Infosys will be aided by the ramp-up of large deals and broad-based strength across verticals. It said there could be a 2.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter revenue growth for TCS with challenges in financial services and retail verticals. But despite a seasonally strong quarter, Wipro is likely to disappoint with 1.2 per cent quarter on quarter revenue growth for the September 2019 quarter.
Revenue growth for HCL will be powered by the completion of the acquisition of select IBM products. Underlying organic growth will likely be weak at 0.7 per cent QoQ due to productivity commitments in large IMS projects and relatively high base of the previous quarter. We expect modest growth of 1.7 per cent in Tech Mahindra with weak growth in the enterprise segment. Hexaware will lead revenue growth in mid-tier companies helped by consolidation of Mobiquity acquisition."

Macroeconomic issues and a slowdown in the banking sector in the US and Europe, along with delays in retail sector deal executions, slowed down TCS’ second-quarter profit growth to a mere 1.8 per cent.
India’s largest IT services firm on Thursday reported consolidated net profit at ₹8,042 crore for the quarter ended September 30, against ₹7,901 crore in the year-ago period. Sequentially, the profit dipped 1 per cent. TCS’ operating margins for the quarter stood at 24 per cent, while net margins came in at 20.6 per cent.
Revenues grew 5.8 per cent to ₹38,977 crore in the July-September quarter, against ₹36,854 crore in Q2 FY19, as concerns remained in its largest vertical, BFSI.
“Our numbers (in Q2) were lower than what we had expected at the start of the year,” acknowledged TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan. “We’ve seen an increase in both deal sizes as well as duration, which is good for long-term growth. But it’ll take time for it to convert into revenues. We would need to deliver H2 much higher than H1 to get to double digits.”
Achieving a better H2, however, will not be easy for TCS. For one, H2 is seasonally weak for IT services, and BFSI is not showing any signs of improvement. Although a further weakness in the rupee could help TCS make up for the lost growth in Q2, it may not be enough to carry it to double-digit growth.
“Insurance, regional European banks and small banks are doing well, but large banks in Europe and the US are under pressure, and there is pressure across the board. In retail, deals have been pushed further than expected. However, since there are no cancellations yet, we hope to convert them in the next few quarters,” Gopinathan said.
From Q1 to Q2 this fiscal, weakness came from retail in US and Europe and markets like India, Japan and APAC, he added. 
There were some greenshoots, however. Digital revenues grew 28 per cent, making up for 33 percent of overall revenues for the quarter. UK grew 13.3 per cent year-on-year, continental Europe grew 16 per cent and the life sciences vertical grew 16 per cent YoY, but not enough to balance the slow growth of 5.3 per cent in the US and 8 per cent in BFSI.
In terms of corporate tax cuts announced by the government, TCS said it will not have any impact on the company as it has decided to continue availing other tax benefits that the government gives. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, TCS has announced to give out ₹40 per share special dividend along with a regular ₹5 dividend this quarter. The statement comes after the government announced a 20 per cent tax on share buyback. TCS said its capital allocation mechanism will be optimised depending on the regulatory framework. 
TCS hired a net 14,097 employees in the quarter, the highest ever onboarded in a quarter. This took the total employee count to 450,738 at the end of the quarter."
20,2019-10-11,TCS,"Why TCS missed Q2 targets 


Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported weaker than expected Q2FY20 on both revenues and margins. The increasing complexity of deals, the impact of e-commerce on IT spends by traditional retail players in the US and higher costs related to hiring locally are weighing on the IT company, according to analysts. 
“Though order intake was at a six-quarter high, including in the BFSI vertical, increasing the complexity of deals is driving a slower conversion into revenues. Deal sizes are increasing but so are deal durations, which again skews the revenue conversion,” said analysts at ICICI Securities. 
TCS reported a disappointing performance in 2QFY20 with USD revenue growing by just 0.6 per cent to $5.51 billion. Poor Retail performance (-0.8 per cent QoQ in USD terms) was one of the reasons that led to the revenue miss. “Retail vertical saw orders getting pushed out, a reflection of stress partly due to the Amazon effect and the continued closure of retail stores in the US,” said analysts at Reliance Securities. 
This is the second successive quarter when the IT major has missed estimates on both revenue and margin.

Lower revenue from the UK (-0.7 per cent) and India (-4.4 per cent) dragged its overall revenue. Service-wise, digital revenue rose 3.7 per cent QoQ in USD terms (slowest sequential growth since 2QFY17), while YoY growth decelerated to 25 per cent (slowest since 4QFY17). Digital services contributed 33.2 per cent to total revenue in 2QFY20 compared to 32.2 per cent in the previous quarter.
“Continuing from 1QFY20, the management called out incrementally cautious commentary led by weak BFSI outlook and worse-than-expected Retail headwinds. The current quarter will see similar trends as well. In such an environment, double-digit growth is a mirage and growth expectations must be watered down, particularly in the context of slowing (albeit still healthy) Digital growth,” said a report from Reliance Securities. 
“ While TCS continues to see healthy orders, conversion to revenue is taking time, partly due to participation in clients’ digital journeys and rising deal sizes leading to the involvement of more executives in decision-making,” it added. 
Margins were weaker on capacity creation as TCS inducted 30,000 campus hires in H1FY20 and should recover going forward but are expected to remain lower than prior expectations.
Large banks across the US and Europe and capital markets segments continue to be the principal sources of weakness. EBIT margin declined by 20bps QoQ to 24 per cent . Employee cost within Selling, General & Administrative Expense (SG&A), which captures bench for TCS has increased by 90bps to 13 per cent of revenues from 12.1 per cent in Q4FY19 driven amongst other things by the induction of 30,000 freshers in H1FY20. Overall headcount increased by 3.2 per cent QoQ in Q2FY20 with a net addition of 14,097 employees being highest ever in a quarter,” said ICICI Securities. The build-out of the offshore bench as the industry continues to see increased offshoring also added to the pressure. 
“September’19 quarter confirm the risks to the company’s earlier suggested outlook of double-digit growth, and we would reckon that the street will align FY20 revenue growth to <9% YoY constant currency growth post these results,” said Emkay Research."
19,2019-10-14,TCS,"Software products are booming: TCS COO 
TCS, India’s largest IT services company, is charting a new course for itself that could lead to its becoming the country’s largest software product company, with revenues already surpassing the billion-dollar-mark.
Three years back, TCS created a new unit Digitate, a pure-play software products company, with its own HR rules, start-up culture, and different pay scales. Even as Digitate is on its way to touching the $100-million revenue mark, TCS’ other software products already generate over a billion dollars in revenues, TCS’ Chief Operating Officer, NG Subramaniam, told BusinessLine.
According to Subramaniam, TCS’ overall products business is way above billion dollars already, and the company could, one day, even list some of these product units on the stock exchange as independent firms.
“We have multiple products companies and our intent is to keep them within TCS. If an opportunity comes to list them separately, we will. But right now we are building products and services to be a strong services company that also has products,” said Subramaniam.
Apart from Digitate which, according to Subramaniam, is one of the fastest growing pure-play software products company in the world, the chunk of revenues come from TCS BaNCS.
“Our BFSI platforms is big business right now... TCS BanCs today has close to 500 clients that run their day-to-day core operations on our platform,” said Subramaniam. For the past few years, TCS has been investing heavily in three Ps — products, platforms and patents. While all three help the company future-proof its services business, it also allows TCS to create new capabilities that can be sold at much higher margins.
As on September 30, the company has applied for 4,874 patents, including 192 during the quarter. It has been granted 1,121 patents, with most of it deployed for software products. Subramaniam acknowledged that the benchmark set for the products businesses is much higher when it comes to margins. So while it may not reflect in the overall company profitability, the high investments being poured into it are aimed at bringing in higher margins and an ability to offer unique capabilities.
“Digitate is a strategic unit; TCS Financial Services that runs TCS BanCS is a separate business unit, and TCS BFSI platform is a separate business unit. We call them strategic growth businesses. We have kept them separate because fundamentally they work differently from services. Pure-play services business remains separate,” said Subramaniam.
So far, Digitate has only one commercial product — Ignio, a cognitive automation tool that competes with the likes of IBM Watson. Other software products from TCS include digital learning tool TCS iON; TCS Algo Retail, a product for retailers; and the largest being TCS BaNCS, a core banking software product suite. To accelerate the growth of the products business, TCS is also using other channel partners now, starting with selling Ignio.
“So far we had been selling Digitate through our own internal sales team and integrated Ignio into our solutions.
“Now we have taken a conscious decision to appoint channel partners to accelerate sales. We have started onboarding partners in the last two quarters. In this quarter, we onboarded three more partners,” said Subramaniam.
To avoid any conflict of interest with clients, TCS is keeping the software products divisions completely away from the services unit. “Opportunity for us is to make, for example, TCS Financial Services a pure products company and outsource implementation to the services team (within TCS) as a systems integrator,” said Subramaniam."

India’s top three IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro — have significantly increased their net employee hiring in the September quarter compared with the previous quarter. The three companies together hired 28,157 employees (net) compared with 16,687 in the first quarter, an increase of 59 per cent.
The increased hiring comes in the backdrop of better business forecast. The hiring, which started to decline from the third quarter of last year, started to gain traction in the first quarter of this fiscal. In the second quarter, it rose further.
Industry leader TCS saw the highest hiring in the September quarter, breaking its own record. The company’s net addition of 14,097 employees was the highest ever in a quarter — breaking the previous record of 12,356 employees set in Q1.
 










 
Sanjeev Hota, Head of Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said: “IT companies see good demand environment going ahead. Deal wins have been robust in the last few quarters. Localisation initiatives in key geographies is also driving recruitment.”
“Our order-book and deal pipeline are very well distributed across verticals and geographies, which gives us confidence from a medium- to long-term perspective,” Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and MD, TCS, told financial analysts while discussing the company’s second-quarter results last week.
“We have been building capacity and gearing up for growth. Our investments in organic talent development continue to help us build up unmatched scale and depth in new technologies. As of September 30, we have trained over 3,22,000 employees in emerging technologies and over 3,91,000 employees in agile methodologies,” V Ramakrishnan, CFO, TCS, added.
Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys, said that the company delivered another strong quarter in Q2, and the performance was robust across multiple domains. The company reported double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter; strong growth in digital; improvement in operational parameters, especially employees utilisation and onsite-offshore mix; large deal signings; and reduction in attrition.
“The hiring is consistent with what we have done in the past. So I do not see any material change to that. Our hiring will be dependent on the growth and we have already factored that in the guidance,” said Pravin Rao, Chief Operating Officer, Infosys."
16,2019-10-16,TCS,"TCS iON launches command centre to monitor exam venues in real-time 


TCS iON, a strategic unit of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) inaugurated its Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Command Centre in Chennai on Wednesday that can monitor more than 6,000 of its unique examination venues across the country, in real-time. 
By layering a digital monitoring platform on the newly developed physical infrastructure, TCS iON aims to provide a superior experience to exam administrators for the fair conduct of exams along with transparency of the exam operations. Based at TCS’ Sholinganallur facility, this Command Centre has the following features:
- Monitoring the exam process through a set of over 150 parameters to prevent, predict and post incidents as alerts for efficient management of the exam 
- Tracking the movement and the devices carried by every candidate at any exam centre via a live CCTV feed
- Predicting the readiness of the centre based on past incidents and the current live feed of events at the exam centre
- Issuing alerts about any malpractice attempts based on the learnings from the malpractice patterns of the past
- Tracking the readiness of all devices being used for conducting the exam, by leveraging TCS’ IoT framework
The Command Centre is engineered to empower TCS iON and its customers to issue proactive automated directions for any observations that warrant immediate action, through instant alerts against anomalies like exam interruptions, unusual behavior on server or candidate systems and the performance of devices being used for the exam process, TCS said in a statement. 
The TCS iON Command Centre is also equipped with a remote Energy Management Solution, which monitors critical power parameters during assessments. Sensors collect real-time data and the temperature of servers and UPS rooms, thereby allowing near real-time monitoring and data analytics for preventive maintenance. This solution will issue instant notifications highlighting critical events for early fault detection, therefore enabling proactive measures to avoid disruption due to power failures or other such issues during exams. 
Venguswamy Ramaswamy, Global Head, TCS iON, said, “The TCS iON Command Centre @ Chennai is truly a benchmark for real-time monitoring of multiple events during high-stake exams. This is our next leap to reimagine the exam monitoring process and assure fair and free exams at scale, even in the remotest locations within and outside India. This is aligned to our vision of making examination processes in the country secure and scalable. The real-time monitoring of the end-to-end examination process has been made possible through an interplay of digital technologies covering cloud, analytics, artificial intelligence driven algorithms, IoT frameworks and other high-end computational and image processing algorithms. By providing such 360-degree assurance, we aim to raise the bar for monitoring large scale exams.” 
TCS iON caters to education boards and recruitment bodies to conduct large-scale and high-stake examinations in India through its Digital Zones. Till date, TCS iON has conducted 3,180 exams for more than 200 million candidates in 6,444 exam venues across 643 cities."

TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan




TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan


 The September 2019 quarter has brought good tidings for both Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys.
Both the firms reported a record Total Contract Value (TCV) — the size of deal struck with customers — of $9.2 billion (combined). TCV reflects an IT company’s ability to win large deals, including renewals.
TCS reported a TCV of $6.4 billion in Q2 — the highest in the last six quarters. Similarly, Infosys recorded a TCV of $2.8 billion, the highest-ever for the company. 
Wipro has not provided the deal numbers. These numbers suggest that the environment is turning positive for the IT sector. 
Sanjeev Hota, Head of Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said that early investments, ability to stitch together large multi-service deals, and participation in clients’ digital transformation journey are the factors that helped TCS win large deals. 
He added that Infosys had made incremental investments in people and digital capabilities in the previous year, which is yielding results now.
Both Infosys and TCS are doing well in terms of deal wins. “We believe that this is a confirmation of the strong order booking for offshore IT services players as digital spending is becoming mainstream and global corporates are investing in terms of their mid-office and back-office transformation,” said an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services. 
The analyst added: “The Tier-1 players have been talking about increased scope and size of deals over the past 18-24 months and the order intake numbers announced in September quarter are a validation of the same.” 
TCS’ CEO Rajesh Gopinathan shared the same view at a recent analysts call. 
“The strong order closure and deal pipeline is an indicator of our growing traction within the customer innovation spends. Our investments in research and innovation and our large portfolio of intellectual property are positioning us well to help customers scale up their innovation efforts,” he said.
Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys, told analysts while discussing the financial results that client metrics remained strong with the company adding 96 new clients during the quarter. 






Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys    -  PTI  
The number of $50-million clients increased by 2 to 61, and the company won 13 large deals with the TCV of $2.85 billion, which is the highest ever. 
Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys    -  PTI 
“While a large part of this was renewals, these renewals solidify our position significantly in our existing client base. Large TCV is up by 75 per cent in the first half of 2019-20 over the same period last year,” he added."

NG Subramaniam, COO, TCS




NG Subramaniam, COO, TCS


The rise of digital technologies and rapid change in skillset requirements are forcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to take a complete relook at talent acquisition and retention.
TCS has been trying to re-imagine hiring in order to attract top talent in large numbers to support its growth. Last year, the IT services firm launched the TCS National Qualifier Test, which attracted nearly 2.2 lakh candidates. The process eliminated the need for campus visits and cut down hiring time to six weeks from the four months.
Of the 2.2 lakh candidates, TCS made offers to 30,000. But in the process, it was also able analyse who the potential outliers of these 30,000 were.
“We are offering the top people who took our national test another test. If they clear that test, we call them Hot Talent and they are offered double the salary,” Milind Lakkad, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Human Resources, told BusinessLine .
“In addition, we decided to do the same for internal employees. We’ve done it for employees with three years of experience. We’re giving them the same digital test,” Lakkad said.
The National Qualifier test shrank the company’s recruitment cycle by 2/3rds and allowed TCS access to talent that wasn’t necessarily studying in top colleges.
“We have understood that the IT industry is in transition. Since two years, we’ve been systematically operating to change the paradigm in terms of talent hiring, recognising top talent and recognising how we should work with customers in a more open and agile way,” said NG Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer at TCS.
“The people who clear the test are absolutely hot digital talent and they are the kind of people who probably would go work for investment banks or Google,” he said.
The hot talent test is going to be one of the toughest tests in the industry, says Subramaniam. “If they are able to show that they can play at that level and they can code at that level, they deserve that (high) salary,” Subramaniam said.
Of the 30,000 people who got selected in the national test, TCS has identified 1,300 to take a more advanced test that could prove them to be the hot talent. For internal employees, while it is still work in progress, some 2,500 people have already been identified.
“For people coming from outside, the compensation will double if they clear the test. For internal employees, based on their experience, they’ll get a significant hike,” Lakkad said.
TCS is also trying to speed up training time to make fresh recruits productive from their first day of work. Online training through the FrescoPlay platform is helping TCS accelerate the shift towards digitalisation. Now, instead of teaching generic computing skills to everyone, TCS can customise training as per individual strength and business requirement."

IT services companies are not typically known for their fat pay packages. That leaves them scrambling for the smartest engineers since product companies like Google and Microsoft end up absorbing top talent with their fat offers.
But India’s largest IT services firm TCS is now willing to pay double the normal fresher salary if you prove yourself to be a ‘hot talent’ that can help the company leapfrog into the digital future. Here’s all you need to know about what ‘hot talent’ means:
The objective of the Hot Talent test (also called the ‘Digital test’) is to identify High-Talent freshers who can take on the more challenging assignments in TCS’ growth and transformation initiatives. The test is tougher, identifies higher-order talent and is typically conducted subsequent to the TCS National Qualifier Ninja test. The selection process also includes a higher-order panel interaction.
Read: Now, TCS will double pay of company’s ‘Hot Talent’
The selection process is gamified across ‘levels’. Toppers from TNQT are given a chance at the Hot Talent/Digital Test. Toppers are identified through multiple lenses, not just straightforward scores. Toppers from TCS’ contest-based drives are also selected into the Hot Talent pool.
The Hot Talent test has already been extended to recent joiners in TCS in a democratised model, following a similar selection format as the Digital Test for freshers
The selection process evaluates higher-order skills in the areas of innate aptitude, programming logic, hands-on coding skills and expertise in top digital areas such as cyber-security, digital infrastructure, software automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and engineering. TCS also look at traits such as (a) passion to explore technology (b) industry awareness and participation, (c) design / creative skills and (d) the ability to articulate one’s point of view / create one’s personal brand – skills that are extremely critical for growth and transformation initiatives."

Innovation hubs to leverage 5G


Indian IT services companies TCS and Tech Mahindra are seeing huge opportunities in the 5G space. While TCS has partnered Qualcomm to set up an innovation hub in Hyderabad, Tech Mahindra, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Business Finland, a government agency directed by the Finnish Minister of Employment and the Economy, for research and development in 5G and 6G. Tech Mahindra will set up an innovation lab in Finland to foster growth and innovation."
3,2019-11-24,TCS,"The outlook for Indian IT companies
For the past few quarters, some of the large- and mid-tier IT services companies have been growing at a fair clip and bagging large deals. Digital deals have started to form a larger part of their revenues while core services for most large- and mid-sized players have seen tepid growth; most of the information-technology services companies’ revenue growth was supported by digital.
But the global economic slowdown and the US-China trade war have had a direct impact on many Indian IT services companies. Except for HCL Technologies, which has increased its revenue guidance (Infosys upped the lower-end of its revenue guidance), most Indian IT services companies have cut their FY20 guidances.
With the first half of FY2019-20 behind us and the global headwinds beginning to hit, let’s take a look at the IT services companies investors can bet on. But before we do that, it’s important to look at the levers pulling these companies in different directions.
One segment where client spends are slowing for almost all IT services providers is banking and financial services. Clients are delaying operationalising some deals that were signed in previous quarters. This is especially true of large banking deals in Europe and capital markets- related projects in the US.
While this slowdown might be transient in nature, it allows investors to take a peek at what the clients are thinking about the future prospects of the economy, and as an extension, its impact on IT services companies. Some mid-tier companies that have been growing at a faster pace than their larger peers, have been impacted by large clients delaying spends to achieve cost savings.
With respect to specific verticals, Infosys, TCS and Wipro saw weakness in client spends in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) which led to slower revenue growth in the quarter ended September 30. In the US, capital- market clients, in particular, are putting the brakes on the spends. But digital projects seem to be providing some succour to most players in this vertical.
Another vertical where revenue slowed in the quarter ended September 30 was manufacturing. The revenue growth of Tech Mahindra, Wipro and HCL Technologies slowed in this segment. Retail clients, such as large-format department stores, of the two largest IT services companies — Infosys and TCS — are holding back their spending, which has led revenues to slow sequentially in the September quarter.
Among the mid-sized IT companies, L&T Infotech has seen its banking and financial services vertical’s revenues slowing for the past three quarters. The segment makes up for nearly 27 per cent of the firm’s total revenues.
The company’s group peer L&T Technology Services’ revenues from the telecom and hi-tech verticals have been slowing for three consecutive quarters (its makes up for over 20 per cent of the firm’s revenues).
The retail, consumer packaged goods and manufacturing verticals of Mindtree, which is also part of the L&T Group now, posted a tepid growth for three consecutive quarters.
In terms of geographies, except for Infosys and HCL Technologies, growth in revenues from Europe seems to have slowed in the past few quarters for the large Indian IT players. The macro challenges in continental Europe — with its largest economy Germany slowing — have taken a toll. While TCS’ revenues from Europe have slowed, it’s tepid growth in North American revenues seems to have surprised investors — revenues from North America grew a mere 0.6 per cent during the September quarter to around $2.8 billion.
Wipro’s European revenues have been hemmed in for the past four consecutive quarters mainly because large banks have been delaying spends due to the uncertain economic environment. Revenue growth from Europe during the quarter was muted. However, the company’s North America revenues bounced back after a tepid June quarter.
Muted growth in its manufacturing vertical impacted Tech Mahindra’s Europe revenues. This in turn was impacted by the macro headwinds being faced in Europe, as the EU economy is slowing down in face of the US-China trade war. The firm’s European revenue growth also took a hit because of cross- currency headwinds.
However, after a couple of quarters of tepid growth, Americas helped Tech Mahindra grow in the September quarter — revenue from Americas grew 5.2 per cent to $ 624 million.
Infosys’ European revenues grew, helped by its acquisition of Stater (mortgage services provider) earlier this year, while HCL Technologies’ growth was helped in part by its acquisition of IBM suite of products, which it completed in the quarter ended September. HCL Technologies’ North America revenues were flat in the September quarter, growing just 0.1 per cent sequentially to $1.6 billion. Infosys posted a decent sequential revenue growth of 2.2 per cent in its North America revenues.








 
On the margin front, the September quarter was always going to be a tough one for IT players with pay hikes being doled out to employees. However, among the top IT companies, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra managed to increase their margins sequentially. A rise in sub-contracting costs for TCS led to margins falling quarter-on- quarter.
In the mid-sized IT space, Mindtree and Mphasis managed to better their September quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins compared with the June quarter. Hexaware Technologies, L&T twins (Infotech and Technology Services), among others, saw their margins shrink during the quarter. Most of these companies reported a fall in margins on a year-on-year basis due to a mix of rising sub-contracting costs and adoption of new lease accounting standards that led to higher amortisation expenses being recognised on the books.








 
Also, pay hikes doled out during the first half of 2019-20 impacted margins on a y-o-y basis. Both large- and mid-sized companies have hired a large number of freshers for future projects. Till the projects come on stream and the newly hired are aligned to those projects, there could be an impact on margins due to lower employee utilisation.
There have been news reports that many IT companies, including Infosys, are looking to cut the flab in their mid-level employee hierarchy. If so, it could help improve margins. The point to note here is that the quarter ending December usually sees many employees in the US take off on furlough, which could also shrink margins a bit (this has an impact on revenue as well).
Infosys’ attrition levels have been above 20 per cent for three consecutive quarters now. In the quarter ended June (seasonally higher attrition), the number had spiked to 23.4 per cent. The management has assured that it would try to curb the runaway attrition rate of employees.
Higher attrition pulls down margins as companies have to hire from outside the company to meet short-term demands for talent. This also leads to an increase in sub-contracting costs. TCS’ attrition is one of the lowest in the industry and has been hovering at 11.2-11.6 per cent over the past four quarters. The company is training its employees in digital technologies and has been busy hiring people to meet its future needs when projects come on stream.










Wipro has managed to bring down its attrition to 17 per cent, from nearly 17.9 per cent in the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Tech Mahindra’s attrition has stayed constant at 21 per cent for four consecutive quarters — it’s one of the highest in the industry, just below Infosys. The company’s sub-contracting costs have been rising for five consecutive quarters — it rose 12.2 per cent sequentially in September.
Among the mid-sized IT companies, the hostile takeover of Mindtree by Larsen and Toubro caused disruption and saw many senior employees leave. This can be seen in the steady rise of Mindtree’s attrition rate, from 13 per cent in September 2018 to 16.5 per cent in September 2019. The hope is that now with the takeover complete, the management would tackle this spike in attrition as it could impact margins going forward.
Hexaware has managed to bring down its attrition rate to 17.3 per cent. It had been hovering at 18.2 per cent for the past two quarters. L&T Infotech has seen its attrition spike in the September 2019 quarter to a 12-quarter high of 18.4 per cent, while its group peer L&T Technology Services has seen its September quarter attrition come in at a seven-quarter low of 13.4 per cent.
The deal pipeline of most IT companies does reduce some of the pessimism about their prospects. But most of the pessimism has already been built into the stock prices.
Of the large IT companies that declared the value of deals signed in the September quarter, TCS bagged $6.4 billion, Infosys $2.8 billion and Tech Mahindra its highest ever quarterly deals of $490 million.
Among the mid-sized firms that declared the value of the deals they bagged in the September quarter, L&T Infotech won deals worth $ 100 million, Mindtree $307 million and Hexaware won net-new deals of $36 million (excluding renewals). The point to note here is that these deals — many of which relate to digital transformation — are a necessity. The clients might postpone the spends in face of uncertainty and macro headwinds, but these deals are eventually essential to the clients’ businesses as they will improve efficiency of operations. As an when the deals ramp up, there will be an increase in revenue visibility.
 
The BSE IT index has had its ups and downs over the past 12 months despite rising 10.6 per cent over the period. Compared with their respective three-year trailing price-to-earnings (PE) multiples, HCL Technologies, Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra and L&T Infotech are all trading at a higher 12-month trailing PE multiple. But Wipro, Mindtree, L&T Technology Services, Hexaware Technologies and Mphasis’ 12-month trailing PE are below their three-year average PE.
While picking stocks to invest in the IT sector, it is important to note the cash flow conversion of the companies and the amount of cash these companies return to investors. A high dividend- yielding company, such as TCS, despite being more expensive than its peers, is any day better than one that has lower conversion of profits into cash.
That’s one of the reasons why TCS trades at such a premium to rest of the pack. HCL Technologies, despite its double-digit revenue growth, is valued at a discount to TCS. One of the reasons is the lower conversion of profits to operational cash flow.
TCS’ diverse capability to implement projects in various domains also helps it stand out, but its revenue growth expectations have come a cropper in 2019-20 due to a tepid first half. However, even though we don’t have a call on TCS, it’s still a good bet for investors because of its high payout ratio (80-100 per cent of free cashflows.) This is what keeps its price elevated compared with its peers.
HCL Technologies is also a good pick because it has managed to organically grow in double digits even with macro headwinds, and has upgraded its revenue guidance after the first half of 2019-20. Investors can consider buying TCS and HCL Technologies in the large-cap space and L&T Infotech and Mphasis in the mid-cap space."
2,2019-12-07,TCS,"Growth pangs in TCS. Should you buy it? 
For investors in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the September quarter results were a bit of a dampener. Although in rupee terms TCS’ revenues grew 2.1 per cent quarter-on-quarter, dollar revenue growth was a modest 0.6 per cent.
With investors having built in double-digit dollar revenue growth for the current fiscal, the subdued growth in the September quarter, after a weak June quarter, has somewhat dampened expectations. The stock did correct post results, but still continues to trade at a premium vis-à-vis other large IT players.
At the current price, TCS trades at a 12-month trailing price- earnings multiple of 24.55 times. This is higher than its three-year average PE multiple of 22.91. Peers Infosys and HCL Technologies trade at a 12-month trailing PE multiple of 19.9 times and 15.1 times, respectively. While near-term risks to growth persist, the premium valuation of TCS is likely to continue.
 








 
Superior EBIT margins, high dividend yield, the company policy of returning 80-100 per cent of its free cash flows to investors and high rate of conversion of net profits into operating cash flows are key positives that augur well for the company, given the weak demand environment. Investors can hold on to their shares and accumulate in declines.
The deceleration in revenue growth in the first half of 2019-20 has been disappointing. TCS had reported 11.4 per cent growth in dollar revenues in FY19.
In the June quarter of FY20, revenue growth in dollar terms was 1.6 per cent q-o-q, moderating to 0.6 per cent in the September quarter. With dollar revenue growth of 7.2 per cent in the first half of FY20 (vs same period last year), expectations of a double-digit growth have taken a knock.
A seasonally weak second half can aggravate the growth slowdown. But TCS’ robust business, a large portfolio of services and investments ahead of deals coming on stream augur well for its long-term growth prospects.
TCS made a net addition of over 26,000 people in the first half of FY20. The company has consistently bagged several large deals in the recent quarters. In the quarter ended September, it bagged deals worth $6.4 billion. But the slow ramp-up of these large deals, impacting growth, is worrying.
The slower revenue growth has also led to lower margins. However, some of the slides in margins were caused by investments made by the company ahead of projects coming on stream.
Also, the firm is still seeing clients spending on their digital transformation. TCS’ digital revenues are growing at a fair clip and now constitute 33 per cent of its total revenue as of September 2019 compared with 19.7 per cent two years ago. With traditional services’ growth turning anaemic, digital services have helped cushion some of the blow on the overall revenue growth.
 








 
 
In rupee terms, TCS’ total revenues in the September quarter grew 2.1 per cent quarter-on-quarter to ₹38,977 crore; dollar revenue grew 0.6 per cent to $5.5 billion. EBIT margins came in at 24 per cent in the September quarter compared with 24.2 per cent in the June quarter.
The net profit in the September quarter fell 1.1 per cent to ₹8,042 crore as higher employee costs due to pay hikes and rising sub-contracting costs weighed on earnings. But high generation of cash from operations, at over 108 per cent of net profit, holds TCS in good stead to tide over near-term volatility.
The retail and consumer packaged goods vertical is witnessing a broad-based slowing of spends by clients. This has led to sequential slowing of revenue growth in recent quarters. Apart from that, the BFSI vertical is also seeing customers cut back on spends. In the US, this is being led by capital-market clients, while in Europe, it is the big banks that are reducing spends.
Manufacturing also saw slow growth during the September quarter. Regional markets such as India, Japan, West Asia and Asia Pacific saw growth shrinking into negative territory sequentially.
The management has been surprised by the slowdown in retail and hopes that the holiday season spending by consumers will boost growth and offset some of the weakness in retail and CPG client spends."
1,2019-12-18,TCS,"Tata Group stocks tank after NCLAT restores Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons head 


Cyrus Mistry




Cyrus Mistry




 Shares of various Tata Group companies on Wednesday plunged up to 4 per cent after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) restored Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons Chairman.
 Tata Global Beverages tanked 4.14 per cent, Tata Coffee plunged 3.88 per cent and Tata Motors dropped 3.05 per cent on the BSE. Tata Motors was the top loser among the BSE Sensex constituents.
 Also, Indian Hotels Company dipped 2.48 per cent, Tata Chemicals fell 1.65 per cent, Tata Investment Corporation 1.22 per cent and Tata Power Company 0.98 per cent.
 In contrast, Tata Consultancy Services stock rose marginally by 0.07 per cent, Tata Metaliks gained 2.07 per cent, Tata Communications 1.68 per cent, Tata Elxsi 1.53 per cent, Tata Steel 1.16 per cent and Titan Company 0.09 per cent.
 In a big win for Cyrus Mistry, the NCLAT on Wednesday restored him as executive chairman of Tata Sons and ruled that appointment of N Chandrasekaran as the head of the holding company of salt-to-software conglomerate was illegal.
 The NCLAT, however, stayed the operation of the order with respect to reinstatement for four weeks to allow Tatas to appeal.
Mistry, a scion of wealthy Shapoorji Pallonji family, was in a coup removed as Chairman of Tata Sons in October 2016. 
Mistry, whose family owns 18.4 per cent stake in Tata Sons, challenged his removal in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)."
0,﻿2019-12-22,TCS,"Weekly Trading Guide: Infosys breaks out of the range
The resumption of the bull trend looks evident as SBI closed the week above the resistance band between ₹332 and ₹335. The stock began the week on the back foot, slipping to the support level of ₹325. This support also coincides with the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bull trend. The stock took support at this level and began to rally. The bullish stance is corroborated by key oscillators. The relative strength index in the daily chart shows a fresh uptick following the rally in price. 
 










 
Also, the moving average convergence divergence indicator is on the verge of entering the positive territory. Thus, traders can continue to take a bullish view and initiate long positions on corrections. The initial stop-loss can be placed at ₹320 and subsequently revised upwards by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock moves upward. The immediate resistance is currently at ₹351 currently — its previous high. The subsequent resistance is at ₹362.
The prevailing bear trend, which has been in place since the beginning of November, appears to be limiting the upside in the stock. The stock of ITC gave up its entire intra-week gains. In the past week, after breaking out of the resistance at ₹243, the stock faced resistance at ₹247.5, and started to decline from that level. This level coincides with the 38.2 Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend, making it a significant resistance. 
 










 
However, fresh short positions are not recommended at the current levels even though the stock is trading with a bearish bias, as the risk-reward ratio is not favourable. Importantly, the moving average convergence divergence indicator in the daily chart shows signs of recovery as it has moved into the positive region. Moreover, the price level of ₹235 is a strong support. Hence, unless the stock breaks either ₹235 or ₹247.5, the trend will be unclear. Until then, traders can adopt a range- trading strategy. The resistance above ₹247.5 is at ₹252; the support below ₹235 is at ₹228.
After consolidating since the beginning of November, the stock of Infosys moved out of the range between ₹690 and ₹725. It rallied past the upper boundary of the range at ₹725 and closed the week at 731.5, confirming the breakout. Thus, the medium- term outlook for the stock has become bullish. Adding to the positive bias, the daily relative strength index has formed a new high, following the breakout. Also, the moving average convergence divergence in the daily chart is exhibiting bullish bias. 
 








 
 
The 21- and 50-DMAs are currently at the same level, ie, ₹710, and the stock is trading well above that level — another positive indication. From the perspective of trading, one can initiate fresh long positions on dips with a dynamic stop-loss. While the initial stop- loss can be placed at ₹700, move it upwards by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock advances. The primary target can be at the resistance level of ₹760 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. On further appreciation, the stock can rise to ₹800.
The stock of Reliance Industries (RIL), which has been in an uptrend since August, has been consolidating within a range for the past month. But recently, it bounced from the 21-day moving average and registered a fresh lifetime high of ₹1,617.55. Thus, the bull trend seems to be gaining traction after the pause. But it should be noted that, despite making new highs, the relative strength index (RSI) and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are showing a lack of momentum. In fact, we can spot a bearish divergence in the RSI, hinting at the possibility of a trend- reversal. 
 








 
 
However, the stock has a solid base at ₹1,534, and unless the price breaks below it, the trend-reversal cannot be confirmed. Also, the 21-day moving average is acting as a reasonable support. So, traders can be cautiously bullish and buy the stock on declines. Place a trailing stop-loss at ₹1,550 and raise it by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock appreciates. The short-term targets are at ₹1,665 and ₹1,700.
Extending the bull run, the stock of Tata Steel surged last week. It breached a crucial resistance at ₹434. Thus, it has formed a new peak in the daily chart, denoting a good upward momentum. Substantiating the bullish bias, the moving average convergence divergence indicator in the daily chart continues to advance, implying considerable strength in the uptrend. 
 
 








 
 
However, while the bull trend is backed by several factors, it may not be favourable to buy the stock at the current levels as ₹460 is a crucial resistance. Also, the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level is at ₹470. So, the price band between ₹460 and ₹470 might act as a resistance band, where the stock can witness some profit- booking. From a trading perspective, it can be approached in two ways. Either initiate fresh long positions on a close above ₹470 with the stop-loss at ₹445 or buy the stock if the price moderates to ₹440 with the stop- loss at ₹425. The potential targets on the upside are at ₹495 and ₹515."
