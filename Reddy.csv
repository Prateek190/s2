 Indivior Plc got a breather on Friday as a US court extended a restraining order blocking a rival from launching a generic version of its best-selling opioid addiction treatment in the US. Dr Reddy's and US-based Mylan NV received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier this month to launch a generic version of Suboxone Film, which generates 80 per cent of Indivior's revenue, forcing the UK company to file an injunction against the decision.
Indivior said its temporary restraining order (TRO) issued on June 15 had been extended for another 14 days, during which time the US court for the District of New Jersey will consider the application and issue a ruling on the injunction. Shares of Indivior, which was spun out from Reckitt Benckiser in 2014, rose as much as 1.9 per cent in early trading, but had edged back to stand little changed by 0730 GMT.
Both Morgan Stanley and Jefferies analysts said the extension was a positive, though the final ruling remained unpredictable. The stock had lost about a third of its value after Dr Reddy's said earlier this month it would launch its new drug regardless of the legal stand-off.
The company warned earlier that the Dr Reddy's launch could result in a rapid and material loss of US market share for Suboxone Film, which is placed under the tongue to suppress cravings. The market share of the drug had declined to 55 per cent by the end of April from 60 per cent last year, the British firm said last month.
Generic rivals in tablet form are already on the US market, which is grappling with an opioid addiction epidemic that killed 33,000 people in 2015. Indivior said it would consider a potential launch of its own generic product if Dr Reddy's launched a copycat version.
Indivior's contingency plans would also focus on optimising the launch of Sublocade, a once-a-month injectable drug to suppress opioid craving launched in the US in February. It tempered expectations for initial sales of Sublocade at the launch, saying it did not want investors to be unrealistic about its prospects in its first year.
The company stuck to its 2018 revenue guidance despite Dr Reddy's getting the go-ahead for its product launch, but said it would revisit the forecast if the move goes ahead. Indivior is set to report first-half results on July 25. Jefferies analysts said reassurance from the company on the progress of Sublocade will be key to sentiment and share price support."

 Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is recalling from the US over 2.36 lakh bottles of Atorvastatin Calcium tablets used for lowering cholesterol, according to a report by the US health regulator.

According to USFDA, a class II recall is initiated in a “situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.” 
A class III recall is initiated in a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences."

It is difficult to predict how long pricing pressures in the US market will continue, according to K Satish Reddy, Chairman, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.
In a joint letter to the investors along with Co-Chairman and CEO GV Prasad, Reddy said the company’s task is to overcome this reality.
“The only way of doing so is to have a strong pipeline of difficult to manufacture complex formulations that address key therapeutic needs,” he said, adding that such launches should step-up to combat the price erosion in some products. 
During FY2018, the Hyderabad-based drug-maker filed 19 new Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) and new drug application with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA).
As on March 31, 2018, the company had 110 generic filings pending approval from the US regulator comprising 107 ANDAs and three NDAs. “Out of these 107, 63 are Para IV of which we believe 30 have first-to-file status,” he said.
Regulatory issues
While saying that the company was “fully committed” to standards of quality, Reddy said in the recent past the company had “significantly enhanced” the standards and procedures.
It has also requested the USFDA to schedule an inspection of the oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada.
Dr Reddy’s sees opportunities in the emerging markets which are now on the long-term upswing.
“We should be able to increase revenues from these geographies through greater sales of simple and complex generics as well as hospital and institutional sales of oncological biosimilars,’’ he said."

36,2018-07-16,Reddy,"Dr Reddy's plunges to 5-week low
Shares of Dr Reddy's Laboratories plunged as Indivior has won a preliminary injunction against the company. The stock nosedived as much as 10.8 per cent to a five-week low of Rs 2,069.95.
A US court has granted Indivior a preliminary injunction blocking Dr Reddy’s Laboratories from selling cut-price versions of the British drugmaker’s best-selling opioid addiction treatment in the United States.
The ruling comes days after Indivior scrapped its full-year guidance citing an “accelerated” loss in US market share to the cheaper version of star drug Suboxone launched by the Indian firm. Dr Reddy's and the US-based Mylan NV had received USFDA's nod last month to sell versions of Indivior's opioid addiction treatment Suboxone Film.
The injunction would adversely impact Dr Reddy's as the company would have to await an appeals court's decision. By that time, more competitors could gain approval, says Nomura. It has retained “buy” rating and a price target of Rs 2,704.
Jefferies analysts say that the injunction is a negative surprise for Dr Reddy's and the risks for FY20-22 EPS estimates have increased after the ruling. The brokerage has retained “underperform” rating, and it has cut the price target to Rs 1,850 from Rs 1,910.
The brokerage adds that the injunction also raises concerns on the company winning '305 patent case’ which will impact FY20/21 EPS for which Suboxone contributes more than Rs 20, in its estimates. Dr Reddy’s stock had fallen 3.9 per cent this year as of last close."

Revenues from India also showed 1 per cent YoY growth at ₹2,330 cr




Revenues from India also showed 1 per cent YoY growth at ₹2,330 cr




 Pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has retrenched a couple of hundred employees in the past few months.
According to sources, those who lost their jobs were mostly from the mid-manager level upwards, including high salaried executives. Those given the pink slip were also from across units and geographical locations. Performance-related issues and cost-cutting were the key reasons cited for the retrenchments.
Falling revenue
The Hyderabad-based company has been facing pressure from falling revenues in the US and on the pricing front there. For instance, the revenues from the US declined to ₹6,360 crore in FY17 from ₹7,545 crore during FY16. 
In addition, it has been at the receiving end of several regulatory issues, especially with the US Food and Drug Administration including inspections of production units..
The company also had a relatively muted fourth-quarter performance. According to GV Prasad, CEO & Co-Chairman, this was mainly on account of the headwinds in the US markets and a temporary drop in sales in Russia, attributable to a shift in the channel purchasing pattern.
Revenues from India, too, showed 1 per cent YoY growth at ₹2,330 crore.
In an effort to handle these challenges, the company appointed a top executive from Teva, Erez Israeli, as the COO in April. He succeeded Abhijit Mukherjee, who retired after a 15-year tenure.
Dr Reddy’s HR issues have been drawing attention with the many exits and retirements “creating some gaps in management team,’’ according to an investor who did not want to be named. However, while responding to queries recently, Prasad said: “I don’t think that we ever had a gap in our team. We replaced the people who left, with even better people.’’
Last year, Chandrasekhar Sripada, President & Global Head of HR, quit Dr Reddy’s. The position was filled by Archana Bhaskar, who is now Chief Human Resources Officer. 
Company’s response 
When asked about retrenchments, Dr Reddy’s spokesperson said: “We are focussing on optimising costs as an organisational priority in multiple areas of our operations. We would not like to comment on the specifics of these initiatives at this point in time.’’
The number of employees on the rolls of the company, however, had gone up to 23,524 as on March 31, 2018 (including 904 on contract) compared to 22,681 in the previous year."
31,2018-07-26,Reddy,"Near 8-fold jump in Dr Reddy’s Q1 profit 
Pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories’ consolidated net profit increased to ₹456 crore in the first quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared with ₹59 crore in the same period last year as per the International Financial Reporting Standards. 
The revenue has gone up by 12 per cent to ₹3,721 crore, its Chief Financial Officer Saumen Chakraborti told newspersons here on Thursday.
“The contribution from generic Suboxone in the US market, forex gain and operative leverage of manufacturing drove growth,’’ he said, adding that the business was in the “right direction”.
G V Prasad, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said focus on operational efficiencies had helped improve margins significantly. 
As part of “organisational redesigning’’, the drug-maker identified about 150 to 200 senior employees for retrenchment, the process was on, he added. During the period under review, revenues from North America increased 10 per cent at ₹1,590 crore driven by contribution from new products primarily Suboxone (at about $15 million, according to market reports as company did not disclose) and partly offset by competitive pressures on some key molecules. 
The revenue from emerging markets increased 16 per cent at ₹664 crore, while in India, it had increased 30 per cent at ₹607 crore. In Europe, price erosion led to 3 per cent dip in revenue. 
R&D spend
The Research & Development (R&D) expenditure in the quarter was little lower at ₹416 crore. “But absolute R&D spend will be at historical levels,’’ Prasad said.
As on June 30, 2018, cumulatively 112 generic filing were pending with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) including 109 ANDAs and three New Drug Applications. Out of 109 ANDAs, 61 are Para IV, out of which 30 have ‘First to File’ status.
Outlook
Going forward, Dr Reddy’s will give priority to a favourable judgement in the ongoing Suboxone litigation, new products, successful resolution of issues with USFDA (on Duvvada Plant) and cost efficiencies.
The company is now waiting to hear from the US regulator after inspection of the plant. 
It had to stop selling Suboxone after three days of sales in the US when it was temporarily restrained by a US court. Over margin trend is “positive’’, according to Prasad."

 Pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories today reported a nearly eight-fold jump in consolidated net profit to Rs 456.1 crore for the first quarter of 2018-19 year mainly on account of robust sales. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 59.1 crore for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories said in a filing to BSE.
 Consolidated revenue stood at Rs 3,720.7 crore in the April-June quarter this year against Rs 3,315.9 crore for the same period year ago. Dr Reddy’s Co-Chairman and CEO, G.V. Prasad, said the first quarter results were boosted by the launch of ‘gSuboxone’, which is indicated for treatment of opioid dependence. The company’s focus on operational efficiencies has helped in significantly improving its margin profile, he added.
“Looking ahead, while we may continue to experience price erosion in the North America generics market, we will also continue to drive growth and cost efficiencies, at the same time, enhancing our quality management systems and building healthy portfolios across the markets we serve,” Prasad said.

30,2018-07-27,Reddy,"Dr Reddy’s Laboratories: Boosted by launches
Pharma major Dr Reddy’s has delivered a stable set of numbers in the first quarter of 2018-19, primarily driven by strong sale of newly launched products in the US coupled with healthy performance in emerging markets. 
Year-on-year, the company’s consolidated net profit for the quarter grew 672 per cent to ₹456 crore from ₹59 crore in the same period last year, thanks to the low base in the same quarter last year due to GST disruption and windfall gain from the sale of Suboxone drug in the US now. 
Consolidated total revenue of the company rose 12 per cent to ₹ 3,721 crore during the quarter from ₹3,326 crore in the year-ago period.
The company’s US business, that contributes 43 per cent to the overall revenue, grew 6 per cent Y-o-Y during the quarter. The new launches particularly, Suboxone, drove growth in the US. This partly offset the pricing pressure in the base business.
In mid-June 2018, the company had launched the Suboxone generic drug (indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence) in the US and enjoyed a windfall gain of $15-20 million till the company received a temporary restraining order from the US court. 
The US District Court of New Jersey had granted a preliminary injunction against Dr Reddy’s, preventing it from selling Suboxone drug in the US while a patent-infringement lawsuit is pending. 
Though the company appeals against the order, the delay in monetisation would lower its revenue in future quarters as more competitors are likely to enter the market.
 
The company’s domestic business that contributes around 16 per cent of the overall revenue, reported a strong growth of 30 per cent Y-o-Y in the first quarter due to a low base of last year, which was impacted on the back of GST implementation. 
Revenue from the emerging markets, including Russia, registered 16 per cent Y-o-Y growth during the quarter, primarily driven by new launches and volume traction in some of the key molecules.
Consolidated operating profit margin expanded significantly to 20 per cent during the quarter against 9 per cent in the first quarter of FY18 due to better product mix and higher Suboxone sales.
The company has guided for 15 more generic drugs approvals in the US in FY19. However, there seems to be a low visibility on lucrative product launches in the near term in the US due to delay in key product launches such as Nuvaring and Copaxone as well as the restraint on Suboxone. 
On the regulatory front, while the company has requested USFDA for inspection at Duvvada facility, the data investigation and analysis at Srikakulam site are expected to be completed by September 2018. On the domestic front, the company expects double-digit growth in India business. The company also plans to grow its biosimilar portfolio in the Indian market."

Our Bureau Hyderabad, October 26 Pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd’s consolidated net profit increased 77 per cent to ₹504 crore in the second quarter ended September 30, 2018 compared to ₹285 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.
The total revenue of the Hyderabad-based company increased 7 per cent at ₹3,798 crore as against ₹3,546 crore in the year-ago period as per International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Announcing this at a press conference held here on Friday, its Chief Financial Officer Saumen Chakraborti attributed the increase in profits to higher sales in the emerging markets such as India, forex gain and increase in other income, among others.
Other income included a gain of ₹46.4 crore on account of sale of rights relating to Cloderm brand (including its authorised generic) and profit on sale of antibiotic manufacturing facility in Bristol, US.
Dr Reddy’s had a flat sales in the US and drop in European business. “But, whatever decline we had seen in the US and Europe was made up by growth in emerging markets and India...” he said. 
Revenue from emerging markets including Russia, CIS countries, Romania and Rest of the World increased 36 per cent due to a spurt in offtake in some of the key molecules.
In India, revenue increased by 8 per cent driven by new products and improvement in base business. Revenues from North America under the global generics segment declined 0.4 per cent.
Following a litigation, the Hyderabad-based company could not sell suboxone in the US during the quarter under review and is now waiting for the judgement.
“Going forward, Dr Reddy’s will focus on on execution, operational efficiency and cost optimisation and resolving pending regulatory issues with the US Food and Drug Administration,” Erez Israeli, Chief Operating Officer, said. 
The USFDA is currently conducting its audit of the Duvvada facility. 
On the future business trend, the COO said emerging markets were expected to “do well” along the US in view of the pipe of the products. 
Dr Reddy’s scrip gained marginally by 0.40 per cent to end at ₹2,403.90 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Friday."

12,2019-02-03,Reddy,"Dr Reddy’s Laboratories: Signs of recovery - Buy
The past few years have not been promising for Indian pharma companies, especially those exporting to the US market. Regulatory tightening, coupled with multiple headwinds in the US and other key markets, have not augured well for Indian drug makers.
However, in recent quarters, there has been a recovery in the business growth of a few pharma players, thanks to subsiding regulatory woes and healthy revenue growth in key markets.
Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is one such company. The pharma major seems set for a rebound from the decline seen over 2015-2017. The last three quarters registered a sequential improvement in its revenue and earnings, driven by growth in its businesses in India, Russia and active pharmaceutical ingredient products.
The company’s operating margin improved significantly in the third quarter of 2018-19 to 23 per cent, from 16 per cent recorded in Q4 FY18, due to optimisation of costs and growth in emerging markets.
Going ahead, Dr Reddy’s is expected to generate better numbers, with improving approval momentum in the US, new launches and product-level cost optimisation. Any early regulatory resolution will improve the company’s earnings.
Investors with a long-term horizon can consider buying the stock.
At the current price of ₹2,787, the stock trades at about 21 times its estimated 2019-20 earnings, compared with its three-year historical average of 35 times. This PE multiple is lower than the valuations that peers such as Lupin and Cipla enjoy — 23 times and 22 times, respectively.
Dr Reddy’s earnings over the last few years have been adversely impacted due to regulatory clampdown, competition in some key products and delay in drug approvals.
Its key facilities — Srikakulam, Duvvada and Miryalaguda — received a warning letter in November 2015 from the US drug regulator for the significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations. The delay in the remedial measures has weighed on the overall performance.
While the company was able to address the issues with Miryalaguda facility, the other two plants continue to remain under a scanner. Lately, in January 2019, the company’s Srikakulum Unit I received Form 483 from the US regulator with four observations. Further delay in regulatory clearance will continue to impact the earnings.
In mid-June 2018, the company launched the blockbuster Suboxone generic drug (indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence) in the US and enjoyed a windfall gain of $15-20 million till the company received a temporary restraining order from the US court.
The court prevented the company from selling Suboxone drug in the US while a patent-infringement lawsuit is pending. The timeline of relaunch is not clear so far. Dr Reddy’s may relaunch the product, if the district court denies the innovator’s appeal for a re-hearing. The Suboxone business in the US will be a four-player market if delayed, albeit Dr Reddy’s is expected to gain around $25 million per quarter from its sale in the next few quarters, once launched.
Dr Reddy’s US business contributed 39 per cent to the total revenue (as of Q3 FY19) and grew by 12 per cent CAGR over the last five years, thanks to the new generic launches. However, its US business has been under trouble in the last few years due to regulatory tightening and price erosion in the base products. Price erosion in key molecules in the US is likely to continue in the next few quarters which would impact its gross margins. Delays in niche product launches are also risk to earnings in the near term.
However, its US business is well-positioned for growth from the generic pipeline in the medium to long-term with niche generic launches, including Suboxone, Copaxone and Nuvarin.
 










The company has guided for two-three launches every month as the portfolio has been accumulated over the last few years.
The pending pipeline in the US comprises 103 pending approvals (59 Para IV filings and 33 first to file) including three NDAs under the 505 (b)(2) route.
While the European business is witnessing a steep pricing pressure for the company in the recent quarters, the business from emerging markets, including Russia, India, Brazil and China show strong traction. The company has indicated that it would leverage its hospital portfolio in emerging markets, which would allow it to build a self-funded model for biosimilar development.
The business from the emerging markets is expected to be strong on the back of a stabilising currency, geographical expansion, robust biological portfolio and ramp-up in institutional business.
In Russia, Dr Reddy’s expects a healthy performance from the tender-driven biosimilar business. This region contributed around 20 per cent to total sales.
The company’s India business contributes 18 per cent to total sales. It has revamped its management for the domestic business and is looking to build mega brands.
The company plans to launch new products, including clinically differentiated products. Its domestic acquisitions have enhanced its presence in the fast-growing chronic segments, including dermatology, respiratory and paediatrics diseases.
China is another growth driver for the company over the long run as the regulatory changes allows for participation in the market by leveraging on its pipeline for the US.
Currently, the company has a high-margin product portfolio in China and has identified around 70 products that would meet local requirements and will help ramp-up its product registrations. In FY19, the company expects R&D spending to be 12-13 per cent of sales. Around 60 per cent of the R&D amount is spent on API and generics and the balance on proprietary products, biosimilars, etc.
For the nine months ended 2018-19, Dr Reddy’s consolidated net sales were ₹11,369 crore, up 7 per cent over the same period last year. Consolidated net profit was ₹1,445 crore, up by 113 per cent Y-o-Y."

 “Businesses can be a force for the good,” said GV Prasad, Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories. 
 He was speaking at the graduation ceremony of the 2019 batch at the Indian School of Business (ISB) on Friday. 
“It can make life easier for customers, meet unmet needs, and bring life-changing inventions to society,” said Prasad.
Exemplifying further, he said the US was currently facing a nationwide problem of overprescription of opioid painkillers, which is leading to serious addiction to the drug. 
“In stark contrast, we have also companies such as Merck in the US that literally gave away profits as they made their revolutionary treatment for river blindness available for free to approximately 18 million afflicted in West Africa and South America,” said Prasad. 
Referring to the success of his own company, he said it was built on three pillars of science and technology, people practices, and good governance. The need for high-quality management professionals at every level in Indian businesses was ever increasing, said Prasad.
In his address, Rajendra Srivastava, Dean, said ISB was among the world’s top institutions with a focus on entrepreneurial research.
“We are No 1 in India in research rankings with just 51 residential faculty. In per capita productivity of faculty, ISB comes No 2 among institutions outside North America.”

Analysts were mixed on Dr Reddy’s Laboratories despite the company reporting a two-fold jump in net profit on Friday.
However, the stock, on Monday, closed 1.48 per cent higher at ₹2,795.25 on the BSE.
Dr Reddy’s Laboratories on Friday announced that its consolidated net profit doubled to ₹1,093 crore in the second quarter ended September 30, against ₹504 crore in the previous-year period. Its total revenue grew 26 per cent at ₹4,800 crore (₹3,797 crore).
However, its global revenue grew 7 per cent, primarily driven by Europe, emerging markets and India. But revenue from North America remained flat at ₹1,426 crore. Price erosion, lower volumes, the impact of a voluntary recall of Ranitidine and temporary logistics issues during the quarter adversely impacted revenue growth in North America, the company said.
According to Emkay, its Q2 adjusted EBITDA at ₹880 crore (excluding one-offs) was 10 per cent above its estimate, driven by lower R&D spends. Adjusted gross margins were flat q-o-q as a sharp recovery in PSAI gross margins was offset by lower gross margins in the generics business. However, it maintains ‘Sell’ recommendation on the stock with a target price of ₹2,580, due to potential disappointments on three key molecules — gSuboxone, gNuvaring and gCopaxone — with higher competition and approval delays. These three account for about one-third of FY21E EPS, it said.
On the other hand, IndiaNivesh Securities recommended a buy on the stock with a target price of ₹3,370. It said “for FY20E, we project US sales to come in at about $940 million with improving launch momentum (30 planned for FY20 with only 10 launched till July-19) to support revenue growth over the next few quarters. While we agree that the CRL on gNuvaring does mean that the earliest possible launch will be in mid-FY21 (with higher probability of competition), we believe Dr Reddy’s launch pipeline should help offset the base business erosion and help maintain gross margins of the US business.”
Motilal Oswal Securities said the company has been progressing well in terms of revenue growth across markets, except the US, and cost reduction initiatives are also fructifying to an extent. However, it maintains ‘Neutral’ NEUTRAL rating with a price target of ₹2,590, reduced from earlier ₹2,620. “We cut our FY20/21 EPS estimate by 11 per cent/3 per cent to ₹107/₹126 to factor in product recalls/associated expenses, deferred key approvals and the delayed pick-up in the gross margin,” Motilal Oswal added.
Similalry, Morgan Stanley maintains ‘Equal Weight’ on the stock with a price target of ₹2,804, Credit Suisse reiterates its outperform stand and a price target of ₹3,055 share.
Edelweiss Securities also maintains a ‘Buy’ recommendation with a target price of Rs 3,400. “With a focused management, promising complex pipeline, 21 per cent earnings CAGR and compelling valuations, the stock remains on strong growth trajectory over FY20–21,” it said.
Though in the last one year, the stock gave a point-to-point return of 15.41 per cent, over three- and five-year periods, it produced a negative return of 9.16 per cent and 12.12 per cent. But on a 10-year scale, the returns are positive at 162.43 per cent, slightly better than BSE Sensex’s return of 153.28 per cent."

Prasco has announced the authorised generic launch of gNuvaring (etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring used to prevent pregnancy). Nuvaring brand’s sales currently stand at about $800 million.
This is the second generic launch for the product within a week’s time (following the launch of Amneal on December 16, 2019). The drug is one of the key expected launches for Dr Reddy’s in FY21. However, launches by competitors earlier than the company could affect the product economics.
 DRRD currently has a complete response letter on the product from the USFDA, although the launch timeline is not clear. In our base case, we assume H2FY21E launch with a contribution of $60 million in FY21 (10 per cent of FY21E EBITDA). This could be at risk, if there is a further delay in the launch or launch by its other competitors in advance. Mayne and Teva are the other known filers.
