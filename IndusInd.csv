The board of IndusInd Bank and Bharat Financial Inclusion (erstwhile SKS Microfinance), approved the merger of the two entities, in an all-stock transaction. Shareholders of Bharat Financial Inclusion (BFIL) will get 639 shares in IndusInd Bank for every 1000 shares held. The share swap ratio implies 11-12 per cent premium to the BFIL’s current price and a multiple of over 6 times its book value as of June 2017 quarter. Kotak Mahindra Bank and IDFC Bank acquired microfinance businesses at 1.9-2.0 times trailing book to value. This makes IndusInd’s acquisition of BFIL an expensive one, leaving very little upside in the near term for IndusInd shareholders; BFIL shareholders, though have been handed a sweet deal.
But expensive acquisition aside, the success of the deal rides on the potential earnings synergies, which we believe is riddled with long term challenges and risks. While IndusInd would benefit from BFIL’s dominant market position and higher yielding loan book, it exposes itself to the vagaries in the MFI space; the underlying structural risks withiin the industry became pronounced post demonetisation.
Given that IndusInd Bank on a standalone basis itself, is trading at a steep valuation of 4.4 times one year forward book, upsides will be limited in the stock over the medium term.


Headwinds in MFI business


While BFIL is the largest MFI in terms of gross loan portfolio (Janalakshmi Financial Services which was the largest MFI, recently received final licence to set up a small finance bank), growth challenges that have emerged post-demonetisation within the MFI industry is a cause for worry. BFIL’s gross loan portfolio stood at ₹9,631 crore as of the June 2017 quarter, a growth of 14 per cent year-on-year. In the same quarter last year, BFIL had registered 76 per cent YoY growth.
Post demonetisation, cash crunch and rising defaults have impacted growth for MFIs. While the sector is slowly limping back to normalcy, it may not return back to high growth of 50 per cent levels anytime soon. Many of the MFIs that have transitioned to small finance banks have been trying to diversify away from MFI lending, given the risks within the portfolio.
BFIL recognises more than 8 weeks overdue loans as NPAs (against RBI’s 90-day norms). In the June quarter, GNPA stood at 6 per cent of loans. While the company has been conservative on provisioning and the management has stated that it has taken much of the hit in the June quarter itself, returning to pre-demonetisation levels of GNPAs looks unlikely.
Acquiring an MFI business, when the sector is facing headwinds could weigh on IndusInd Bank’s earnings.


Many ifs and buts in synergies


Microfinance forms about 2.5 per cent of IndusInd’s loans, which would inch up to about 7 per cent of loans, according to the management. The increase in IndusInd’s market share in microfinance should boost its overall growth. IndusInd’s decision to transfer BFIL’s employees and operations into a wholly owned subsidiary, making it a captive business correspondent, is also a positive. BFIL has a cost to income ratio of around 52 per cent (as of June 2017), higher than that of IndusInd’s at 45-odd per cent. Hence keeping physical assets in a separate entity, makes sense. Lower risk-weights for MFI portfolio in IndusInd (75 per cent) as against BFIL’s 100 per cent, should also free up some capital.
But earnings synergies could be long-drawn and weighed by structural risks.
Key benefits of the merger touted by market players are improvement in yields, margins and hence return ratios. BFIL’s gross yield as on June 2017 stood at 19.7 per cent as against IndusInd’s 11.5 per cent (11.2 per cent as of September 2017). Hence there would be an improvement in yields post-merger. There could also be a fall in cost of funds (by 3 per cent as indicated by the management).
But the cost to comply with cash reserve (CRR) and statutory liquidity (SLR) requirements, could eat away some of the margin gains. BFIL’s weaker asset quality would also increase the cost of provisioning.
One of the biggest arguments in favour of the merger, has been the leveraging of BFIL’s large customer base for deposits. But mobilising deposits from existing MFI customers will be a tall task, given the weak savings pattern within this segment. Other MFI players transitioning into small finance bank such as Bandhan etc. have faced similar challenges. Incremental cost savings could accrue if IndusInd, is able to raise lower cost bulk deposits to replace BFIL’s current borrowings, which would be long-drawn.
Also, IndusInd has been growing its loan book by 25-30 per cent over the last couple of quarters. Funding BFIL’s loan book through its existing customer deposit base would be difficult."
59,2018-01-08,IndusInd,"Paytm Payments Bank, IndusInd tie up for FD facility
Paytm Payments Bank today said it has partnered Induslnd Bank to introduce a facility to create a fixed deposit when the customer balance exceeds Rs 1 lakh at the end of day.
Paytm Payments Bank customers can redeem their deposits instantly, anytime without paying any pre-closure or miscellaneous charges and can earn up to 6.85 per cent annual interest, the company said in a statement. Additionally, if a customer becomes a senior citizen before the maturity period, the account will be auto renewed under the senior citizen scheme, thus earning higher interest, it added.
“Majority of Indians prefer safer investment options that offer them higher earning potential. Our offering will add the much-needed convenience of zero paperwork, instant redemption and no charges to one of India’s most preferred investment methods,” Paytm Payments Bank MD and CEO Renu Satti said."

IndusInd Bank on Monday said it has concluded a $500-million three-year syndicated term loan facility from a group of overseas lenders. The private sector lender said the proceeds of the loan will be used for general banking purposes.
""This funding along with the funds raised during this financial year from multilateral institutions -- Asian Development Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corporation -- will help the bank in expanding its lending to clients,"" said IndusInd Bank in a stock exchange notice."
66,2018-01-08,IndusInd,"BFIL merger with IndusInd: A testimony to rural banking’s potential
IndusInd Bank’s takeover of Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd (BFIL) is indicative of the potential in rural banking and of microfinance, which now appears to have become a viable model for financial inclusion.
The merged entity will have over 3,600 branches and outlets and a customer base of 16.3 million. IndusInd Bank will have an increased outreach of 1,400 MFI outlets and 6.8 million borrowers, as per available data. The net worth of the merged entity will be ₹23,921 crore while total assets will stand at ₹2 lakh crore. IndusInd Bank (IBL) has a comfortable Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 16.18 per cent, and the corresponding figure for BIFL is 31.8 per cent.
IBL is now likely to focus on rural banking as it transfers BFIL’s employees and operations into a wholly-owned captive Business Correspondent subsidiary.
For BFIL, which, in its earlier avatar as SKS Microfinance Ltd, lost out on a chance to become a small finance bank — the RBI had denied it a licence in 2015 — the merger with IBL has proved a ‘short-cut’. BFIL’s clients will now have access to all the benefits of a ‘universal bank’, said MR Rao, its Managing Director and CEO.
The cost of funds has been coming down for BFIL in the recent past, allowing the micro lender to charge the lowest interest rates among NBFC-MFIs. As part of IndusInd Bank, it can now look forward to lower cost of funds.


A new journey begins


For BFIL, the deal marks the end of a roller-coaster ride, if one takes into consideration its journey to fame and prominence as the country’s first MFI to go public. Before it morphed into an microfinance institution, SKS was an NGO founded by Vikram Akula, who later became a poster boy for the MFI sector.
But soon, crisis enveloped SKS and other MFIs due to allegations of harassment of clients by recovery agents in Andhra Pradesh, and the high rates of interest charged. The AP Regulation of Money Lending Act 2010 and subsequent shrinking of the MFI sector contributed to SKS’ tumble.
Incidentally, Saturday was the seventh anniversary of the Andhra Pradesh MFI Act, which created mayhem in the sector but brought about much-needed protection of the poor borrowers into focus. The legislation helped weed out irregularities in the sector. The RBI, too, chipped in with a new regulatory regime. Both actions restored the credibility and viability of the MFI model.
But SKS survived all these, and staged a comeback by a slew of measures aimed at cost-optimsation, better corporate governance and self-regulation.
With the merger, the microfinance model is on the threshold of a new journey. With corporate lending under a cloud due to NPAs and micro-loans exhibiting a near-99 per cent repayment rate, others players will surely be watching."

56,2018-01-16,IndusInd,"IndusInd Bank: A well-diversified portfolio pays off


Romesh Sobti, MD and CEO, IndusInd Bank




Romesh Sobti, MD and CEO, IndusInd Bank


IndusInd Bank has been registering 25-30 per cent earnings growth in the last couple of quarters and it kept up its performance in the latest December quarter as well, reporting a 25 per cent rise in net profit.
Above-industry loan growth, healthy uptick in fee income, and robust traction in low-cost deposits sum up IndusInd’s third quarter performance.
But for the slight increase in bad loans — from 1.08 per cent of loans in the September quarter to 1.16 per cent in the December quarter — it has been business as usual for the private lender. The rebound in commercial vehicle financing, a third of its retail loans, has been a key driver for the bank’s loan growth.
After clocking a modest 11 per cent growth in 2016-17, growth in the CV segment has been inching up over the past three quarters; in the December quarter, CV loans reported a 23 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) growth.
Over the past year, even as asset quality concerns emerged across several private sector banks, IndusInd’s performance remained resilient.
A well-diversified portfolio has led to the bank reporting above-industry loan growth.
In FY17, for instance, even as growth in commercial vehicle financing slowed, other segments within retail, such as car loans, credit card and loan against property kept loan growth in good stead.
Within corporate loans too, a broad portfolio helped. The bank’s largest single exposure is capped at 5.4 per cent, to the gems and jewellery sector.
Given that IndusInd is one of the largest CV financiers in the country, consistent uptick in commercial vehicle loans augurs well for its earnings in the coming quarters.
IndusInd reported a strong 25 per cent growth in loans and, in turn, a healthy 20 per cent growth in its net interest income during the December quarter. The healthy growth of 17 per cent in the bank’s fee income has further aided earnings.
The marginal fall in net interest margin from 4 per cent in the September quarter to 3.9 per cent in the December quarter has been on the back of decline in yields on advances. However, given that the bank has a relatively higher proportion of fixed rate loans (70 per cent), margins have remained more or less stable over the past year.
A healthy traction in low-cost CASA deposits has also aided margins. The bank’s one-year MCLR has fallen from 9.45 per cent as of December 2016 to 8.85 per cent as of December 2017. The 60-odd basis points fall in yields over the past year has been offset by the commensurate fall in cost of deposits.
IndusInd’s bad loans have been under check, despite the stellar run in loans.
The slight increase in bad loans during the December quarter has been broad-based and not specific to any one particular account.

Sportstar"
55,2018-02-11,IndusInd,"IndusInd Bank: Noteworthy performance - Buy
The stellar rally in the stock market over the past year or so appears to be losing ground. Much of the euphoria has been led by mid- and small-cap stocks, where valuations have sky-rocketed, without any significant turnaround in fundamentals. There are, however, other stocks that have commanded a higher premium in valuations, thanks to sound financials and steady earnings growth, in an otherwise lacklustre environment. In the ongoing market correction, such stocks offer good buying opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon.
IndusInd Bank, that has been consistently delivering 25-30 earnings growth in the last several quarters, despite challenges within the sector, is a good bet for investors over the long run. The stock’s valuation has gone up significantly since our last buy call last January, along with the broader market rally.
From a three-year historical average of three times the one-year forward book value, the stock has been trading at 3.8 times on an average in the past one year. But an above-industry loan growth, robust traction in low-cost deposits, stable margins and steady asset quality, lend comfort to the notable rise in valuations.
 
The stock as such had gained a little over 33 per cent in the last one year up until the Budget — only slightly outperforming the market indices.
Hence, the run up in the stock, given its strong underlying fundamentals, is not a concern. But given that the market has only now begun correcting and can see some more pain in the near term, investors would do well to accumulate the stock in dips over the next couple of months.
Bad loans under check
IndusInd Bank has been able to ward off sudden shocks and nasty surprises on the asset quality front which, given the widespread concern in the banking system, is noteworthy. Since December 2015 (RBI’s asset quality review), the gross non-performing assets have remained within a narrow range of 0.8 per cent to 1.1 per cent of loans.
Underlying strong growth in credit has helped mitigate the increase in bad loans in absolute terms. In the latest December quarter, while GNPAs have slightly inched up to 1.16 per cent from 1.08 per cent of loans in the September quarter, it has been broad based and not specific to one account. The RBI’s divergence report on the Annual Risk Based Supervision for FY17 however is still awaited. Nonetheless, the bank’s well-diversified loan portfolio, a small restructured book (0.15 per cent of loans) and lower exposure to stressed sectors, lend comfort on the asset quality front.
Strong growth








 
A well-diversified portfolio has also helped the bank deliver above-industry loan growth. In FY17, for instance, even as growth in commercial vehicle financing slowed, other segments within retail such as car loans, credit card and loan against property kept loan growth in good stead. Within corporate loans too, a broad portfolio has helped.
One of the largest CV financer in the country, IndusInd’s consistent uptick in commercial vehicle loans, augurs well for its earnings in the coming quarters. In the December quarter, CV loans have reported a 23 per cent Y-o-Y growth.
Overall, IndusInd’s loan book grew by a robust 25 per cent Y-o-Y in the December quarter, driven by 26 per cent growth in corporate loans and 24 per cent in retail.
Stable margins
Despite the sharp fall in lending rates over the past year, the bank has been able to maintain margins at 4 per cent levels.
The bank’s marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) has fallen by 60 bps between December 2016 and December 2017.
But the bank’s relatively higher proportion of fixed rate loans (70 per cent) and a healthy traction in low-cost CASA deposits has aided margins.
Going ahead, with interest rates in the economy expected to rise, pressure on yields should ease.
As such, IndusInd has already increased its one-year MCLR by 10 bps in the past month. This should provide some cushion.
Aside from a healthy growth in core net interest income, the bank’s strong growth in fee income is a key positive.
The bank boasts of a robust return on assets of 1.9 per cent and is well capitalised to fund its robust loan growth."
54,2018-02-20,IndusInd,"No direct or indirect exposure to cos floated by Nirav Modi: IndusInd Bank


Private sector lender IndusInd Bank today said it has no direct or indirect exposure to firms floated by scam-tainted Nirav Modi.
The bank, one of the most active lenders in the gems and jewellery sector, however has a “small” exposure to Gitanjali Gems, promoted by Modi’s uncle Mehul Choksi which is also an accused in the Rs 11,400-crore fraud.
“IndusInd Bank has no direct credit exposure to Nirav Modi nor any indirect credit exposure in a statement.
“As regards Gitanjali Gems, the bank has a small, two- digit exposure, not linked to any LoUs,” it added without revealing the amount.
The statement comes more than a week after PNB disclosed that conduct of its officials at the Brady House branch in the financial capital had resulted in a potential fraud of $1.7 billion.
IndusInd Bank statement said the fraud has taken place due to non-adherence of procedures and norms laid down. It termed this as a “stray incident” which will not have any contagion effect on its overall gems and jewellery lending business.
Citing a Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council, India (GPEC) press statement, IndusInd Bank said there are stringent norms for bank finance to the gem and jewellery trade stipulated by the Reserve Bank of India and the Government of India.
“The present incident has taken place due to non-adherence of procedures and norms laid down and this stray incident is not expected to have any contagion effect on the overall gems and jewellery business,” it said.
On Wednesday last week, PNB had said it detected a fraud in which diamond merchant Nirav Modi allegedly acquired fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs) from one its branches for overseas credit from other Indian lenders, and is being probed by CBI and Enforcement Directorate among other agencies."

Net profit for the fiscal 2017-18 rose by a similar 26 per cent to Rs 3,605.99 crore compared with Rs 2,867.89 crore in 2016-17.


 Private sector lender IndusInd Bank has reported a 27 per cent increase in its net profit at Rs 953.09 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, led by an uptick in net interest income.
Net profit for the fiscal 2017-18 rose by a similar 26 per cent to Rs 3,605.99 crore compared with Rs 2,867.89 crore in 2016-17.
IndusInd Bank, which is the sixth largest private sector lender, also reported a 20 per cent increase in net interest income at Rs 2,0007.59 crore in the fourth quarter. For the whole of 2017-18, its net interest income grew 24 per cent to Rs 7,497.45 crore.
Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans stood at 1.17 per cent at end-March, compared with 1.16 per cent in the previous quarter and 0.93 per cent a year earlier.
“We are tracking well on the first year of our Planning Cycle four,” said Ramesh Sobti, Managing Director and CEO, Indus Ind Bank.
Addressing reporters, Sobti said the bank expects to integrate business with Bharat Financial by July. “We have already received NoC from the Competition Commission of India and the Reserve Bank of India,” he said, adding that the bank is now awaiting approval from SEBI, following which it will also require clearance from the National Company Law Tribunal.
Sobti also said that IndusInd Bank has not faced any issue of currency shortage and all its ATMs are working properly.
“We just had cash shortage in Karnataka but we flew money from elsewere. There is no cash shortage in other places,” said Sumant Kathpalia, head, consumer banking, IndusInd Bank."
49,2018-04-19,IndusInd,"Bad loan divergence weighs on IndusInd Bank’s performance 
 
It could be because the market was driven to boredom by banks reporting bad loan divergences now and then. Or the late assessment of fiscal 2016-17 at a time when all eyes are on the performance in 2017-18. Whatever the reason, the market’s somewhat indifferent reaction to IndusInd Bank reporting ₹1,350 crore of bad loan divergences pertaining to 2016-17, comes as a bit of a surprise.
True, with some of the accounts already repaid in full or classified as NPAs before the divergence report, the actual impact of the divergence has been much lower in the latest March quarter. But given that the bank had reported gross NPAs of ₹1,054 crore for 2016-17, divergence amounting to nearly 130 per cent of the reported NPA numbers is a matter of concern. The impact this would have had on the bank’s GNPA ratio in 2016-17 would have been similar to the one seen in the case of Axis Bank – a much bigger bank and a corporate lender.
What’s of concern?
 
 








 
In 2016-17, IndusInd Bank had reported just 0.93 per cent GNPA ratio. However, if one were to take the divergence into account, the GNPA ratio would have been a much higher 2.1 per cent of loans. Considering that the bank’s GNPA has been a maximum of 1 per cent of loans over the past four to five years, the notable spike could have rankled investors.
Axis Bank or YES Bank, which had reported steep bad loan divergences pertaining to 2016-17, in the second quarter of 2017-18, were hammered 7-9 per cent post announcement of results. Most of IndusInd Bank’s divergences reported in the fag end of the fiscal have either been repaid in full or declared as NPAs already by the bank in the last one year, thus reducing the impact of the divergence to a mere ₹186 crore in the March quarter.
Nonetheless, the numbers in terms of spike in GNPA ratio are almost as bad as of its peers. Axis Bank had reported ₹4,867 crore of divergences pertaining to 2016-17, implying a 1.3 percentage points jump in the GNPA ratio than that reported by the bank then; IndusInd Bank’s divergence also indicates a similar 1.2 percentage points increase in its GNPA ratio for 2016-17.
Also, on sequential basis, GNPAs in absolute terms have grown by 14 per cent. Despite a 42 per cent sequential increase in provisions, the coverage ratio has slipped to 56 per cent in the March quarter, from 60 per cent in the December quarter."

According to the scheme of arrangement for the merger, which was announced in mid-October 2017, BFIL shareholders will receive IBL’s shares as consideration.

47,2018-05-31,IndusInd,"IndusInd, UCO Bank withdraw advisories on Iran trade
In a major relief to exporters of goods to Iran, IndusInd and UCO Banks have withdrawn their advisories instructing that all export transactions with the Islamic republic be completed by October this year.
This follows intervention by the Commerce Ministry, which pointed out to the Department of Financial Services that such restrictions are uncalled for, given India’s position on the US sanctions against Iran.
“Our exporters have confirmed that both UCO Bank and IndusInd Bank have withdrawn their advisories. Now the panic amongst exporters will be over and the situation can return to normal,” said Ajay Sahai, Secretary General, Federation of Indian Export Organisations.
Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj had said on Monday that India recognises only the sanctions announced by the UN, and not by individual countries.
IndusInd and UCO Bank, which handle all the transactions between India and Iran, had issued their advisories after the US decided to withdraw from the nuclear accord that Iran had reached with the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany in 2015. Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow international inspectors in return for the lifting of economic sanctions that the Western economies had imposed on it.
“Since the US gives a 90-day grace period to countries to finish off their business with a country against which it applies sanctions, IndusInd and UCO Banks got anxious and gave a timeline of October to Indian businesses. Since UCO Bank has hardly any exposure in the US, there was no need for it to panic. However, the matter has been resolved with the Department of Financial Services stepping in,” Sahai said.
The Centre, however, is watching developments surrounding Iran keenly and is trying to work on a contingency plan in case there is more trouble.
Iran is India’s third largest supplier of oil and the economic sanctions imposed by the West against Iran a few years back had sent the country into a tizzy. India’s export to Iran in 2017-18 was at $3.37 billion while its imports were at $11.11 billion."

Romesh Sobti, CEO and MD, IndusInd Bank


Private sector lender IndusInd Bank, on Tuesday, registered a 23.7 per cent increase in net profit in the first quarter of the fiscal at ₹1,036 crore.
It had registered a net profit of ₹837 crore in the first quarter of 2017-18 and ₹953 crore in the fourth quarter of last fiscal.
Total income grew to ₹6,369.75 crore in the reported quarter, compared to ₹5,302.77 crore in the year-ago period.
The core net interest income rose 20 per cent to ₹2,122 crore with a 29 per cent loan growth, while the non-interest income moved up to ₹1,301 crore from ₹1,167 crore in the year-ago period.
There was a marginal increase in bad loans as gross non-performing assets (NPAs) stood at 1.15 per cent of gross advances as on June 30, 2018, against 1.09 per cent in the same period a year ago. However, it was marginally lower than the 1.17 per cent at the end of the fourth quarter of last fiscal.
In absolute terms, gross NPAs or bad loans stood at ₹ 1,740.62 crore, compared to ₹1,271.68 crore a year ago.
Net NPAs in the first quarter stood unchanged at 0.51 per cent, the same as in the previous quarter. It was, however, marginally higher than the 0.44 per cent in the first quarter of last fiscal.
The bank also made a provision of ₹350.01 crore for the June quarter for bad loans as well as contingencies, against ₹309.97 crore a year ago.
“We have had all-round robust performance with good through put on all three drivers of our growth,” said Romesh Sobti, CEO and MD of the bank, adding that the overall asset quality also improved with NPAs at one of its lowest levels.
Corporate advances increased 30 per cent and retail lending grew 28 per cent in the first quarter. Vehicle loans also grew by over 50 per cent, and Sobti predicted robust growth for the next two years.
The growth in corporate advances was diversified, with insolvency resolution loans, power transmission and renewables being the largest users of credit, he said, adding that the bank is open but cautious to project finance.
Net interest margin was marginally lower at 3.92 per cent in the first quarter of the fiscal from 3.97 per cent in the previous quarter because of repricing of the loan book and rise in cost of deposits.
Sobti said the return on assets for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, improved to 1.91 per cent against 1.86 per cent a year ago.
The bank also made mark-to-market losses of ₹86 crore on account of the hardening of yields of government securities and has made full provision for it.
Merger with BFIL
Sobti further said that the merger with Bharat Financial Inclusion (BFIL) has received most approvals, and should be completed in the next three months. “We will file for approval from the National Company Law Tribunal next week,” he said.
The bank is also working on the acquisition of IL&FS Securities Services and hopes to complete it by the end of the current quarter.

41,2018-07-10,IndusInd,"IndusInd Bank: Starts year on a positive note 
A loan growth above industry average, healthy growth in fee income and steady asset quality have helped private lender IndusInd Bank kick off the earnings season on an upbeat note.
The concern over bad loan divergence that had weighed on the bank in the March quarter appears to have abated for now.
The bank’s gross non-performing assets stood at a comfortable 1.15 per cent of loans in the June 2018 quarter. But for the slight fall in its net interest margin, IndusInd’s core performance seems to have checked all the right boxes.
CV financing
For IndusInd, which has a well-diversified loan portfolio, growth has not been an issue. After clocking a robust 28 per cent growth in loans in FY18, the bank began the current fiscal too on a strong footing.
The 29 per cent Y-o-Y growth in credit in the June quarter has been driven by healthy traction in both corporate and retail loans. What has particularly aided the bank’s core performance over the past three to four quarters has been the steady up-tick in commercial vehicle financing that took a knock in FY17.
After clocking a modest 11 per cent growth in FY17, CV loans reported a 27 per cent Y-o-Y growth in FY18.
The growth has further moved up to 33 per cent in the latest June quarter. Broad macro indicators only suggest steady traction within the CV space, going ahead.
Other segments within retail are in any case firing on all cylinders. Corporate loans, too, have seen strong growth, aiding overall loan growth.
In the June quarter, IndusInd witnessed a marginal dip in its net interest margin. One reason could be the strong growth in corporate loans (vis-à-vis retail loans), which carry a relatively lower yield.
Two, IndusInd’s relatively higher proportion of fixed rate loans (70 per cent) that aided margins in a falling rate scenario, could weigh somewhat on margins as deposit rates continue to rise.
That said, the bank’s healthy share of low-cost CASA deposits and strong loan growth should keep margins within a narrow band.
Over the past year, steep bad loan divergences reported by banks – both public and private sector banks – have been a cause for worry.
In the previous March quarter too, IndusInd had reported ₹1,350 crore of bad loan divergences pertaining to FY17.
The RBI’s February circular on stressed accounts that has done away with all the old restructuring schemes has somewhat narrowed the possibility of sharp divergences, going ahead.
Nonetheless, the divergence report for FY18 will be a key factor to watch for to assess the big picture on asset quality. IndusInd’s GNPA ratio has been around the 1 per cent mark over the past four to five years. A notable spike could unsettle investors."

39,2018-08-08,IndusInd,"Why the run up in private banks may need watching


The fundamental performance of private sector banks does not mirror the market’s exuberance.




The fundamental performance of private sector banks does not mirror the market’s exuberance.


 It is not unknown that private sector banks—with better earnings visibility and a somewhat more resilient show—have been the darlings of the market in the recent past. In the last one year, while the stock prices of PSU banks have fallen sharply, a few private sector banks have continued their strong run. With too much money chasing too few stocks, valuations of some of the private bank stocks are at historical levels.
But interestingly, the fundamental performance of private sector banks does not mirror the market’s exuberance. For one, over the past four quarters, the core net interest income of private sector banks, has been moderating. Slowing loan growth in some of the larger banks, pressure on margins and sudden shocks on the asset quality front have impacted banks’ core income from lending. Two, bad loans have been creeping up too, leading to higher provisioning, impacting earnings. Three, the rise in government bond yields have led to treasury losses, eating into their core income. All of this has led to profit shrinking on a yearly basis for two consecutive quarters for the entire pack.
Core income moderates
While private banks have managed to grow their loan book through market share gains (as their PSU counterparts consolidate balance sheet), strong retail and SME focus and healthy capital base, the growth in core interest income has slipped. From 16 per cent levels in the June quarter last year, growth in net interest income slowed to 12 per cent in the March quarter. While growth has managed to inch up to 14 per cent in the June quarter, a low base and some one-off recoveries in few banks has helped. Sustainability of the trend needs to be seen.
For HDFC Bank, despite the healthy traction in loans, the growth in the bank’s net interest income has slowed in the last two quarters. From 24 per cent YoY growth in the December 2017 quarter, net interest income grew by a slower 17.7 per cent in the March 2018 quarter and by 15.4 per cent in the latest June quarter. For IndusInd, growth has slowed from 31 per cent levels in June quarter of last year to 20 per cent in the June 2018 quarter. From a robust 30-40 per cent growth last year, net interest income growth moderated to 23 per cent in the latest June quarter for YES Bank.
A consistent moderation in growth, not priced into valuations can weigh on stock prices, if markets turn volatile.
Big daddy banks under pressure
Axis Bank and ICICI Bank—two large private sector banks—have weighed heavily on the performance of the entire pack. Core income growth for these banks has in any case been tepid—at flat to low single-digits. Axis Bank’s net interest income growth that inched up to 12 per cent in the June quarter, has been aided by a one-time impact of interest realisation from recovery on an IBC account.
On the asset quality front, after the one-time hit in the March quarter, on account of the RBI’s diktat on stressed assets, slippages still remain elevated for both Axis and ICICI Bank. For Axis Bank, addition to its stressed assets pool remains a concern. For the rest of the private bank universe too, bad loans have been on the rise over the past four quarters.
YES Bank reported sharp divergences in the September 2017 quarter. There has also been a notable rise in gross slippages in the latest June quarter. IndusInd Bank, had reported bad loan divergences pertaining to 2016-17, in the March quarter.
HDFC Bank too has been reporting additions (though modest when compared to peers) to its bad loan book. While the GNPAs for the bank, in absolute terms, has gone up by 30-40 per cent YoY over the past few quarters, a healthy growth in loans has kept delinquency ratio at bay. 
Hence, the divergence report for FY18 will be a key factor to watch for, to assess the big picture on asset quality for private sector banks.
Overall the profit growth for private sector banks fell sharply from 23 per cent in March 2017 quarter to single digits in the December 2017 quarter. In the March and latest June 2018 quarter, profit has shrunk by 37 per cent and 16 per cent respectively for the entire private bank universe. Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, South Indian Bank, Karur Vysya Bank—all recorded a steep fall in profit in the latest June quarter."

Private sector lender IndusInd Bank posted a subdued 4.6 per cent increase in net profit at ₹920.25 crore for the second quarter of the fiscal due to a one-off prudential contingency provision of ₹275 crore on exposure towards troubled Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services group.
“This is a precautionary measure which can be clawed back, and is based on a worst-case scenario judgement. We hope the resolution plan comes by the end of the month,” said Romesh Sobti, Managing Director and CEO, IndusInd Bank, after announcing the second quarter results of the lender on Monday.
“Advances granted to various companies belonging to a group in the infrastructure sector...are classified as standard,” the lender said in a statement.
While declining to give the exact exposure to IL&FS and group firms, Sobti said it is in the nature of loans, including one to a special purpose vehicle, which is AAA-rated, and is expected to be among the first to be sold off.
The bank’s management is monitoring the developments and implications of the resolution plan.
In the normal course of business, without making the provision, IndusInd Bank would have registered a 25 per cent increase in net profit, said Sobti.
The bank had registered a net profit of ₹880.10 crore in the quarter ended September 30, 2017.
Net profit for the half year ended September 30 grew 14 per cent to ₹1,956 crore against ₹1,717 crore a year ago.
Total income of the bank rose to ₹6,755 crore during the September quarter, from ₹5,395 crore in the same period in 2017-18.
The net interest income of the lender grew 21 per cent to ₹2,203 crore in the July to September quarter of this fiscal, compared to ₹1,821 crore a year ago. Other income grew 10.9 per cent to ₹ 1,317.28 crore in the quarter under review from ₹1,187.57 crore a year ago.
Gross non-performing assets (NPA) of the bank rose marginally to 1.09 per cent during the quarter from 1.08 per cent in the same period last year. Net non-performing assets rose slightly to 0.48 per cent in the second quarter from 0.44 per cent a year ago.
Provisioning by the bank rose to ₹590.27 crore during the quarter from ₹293.75 crore in the year-ago period.
Sobti also expressed confidence that the acquisition of IL&FS Securities Services (ISSL) is on track despite the recent developments around the holding company and its subsidiaries.
“We have engaged with the new management. There is willingness and determination on both sides to conclude the transaction,” said Sobti, adding that all regulatory approvals came before the end of September.
“It will happen sooner than later,” he stressed. IndusInd Bank had, earlier this year, announced it would buy a 100 per cent stake in IL&FS’s brokerage business, ISSL.

 Debt-laden Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services has decided to begin monetisation of its assets and will restart the sale process of IL&FS Securities Services and ISSL Settlement and Transaction Services.
The decision was taken by the IL&FS board on Monday as part of measures to resolve troubles at the group and pay off its debt.
“In order to ascertain market interest and examine feasibility of maximisation of value in an orderly and transparent manner, the board, while continuing to evaluate all options, has today initiated the process of exploring the sale of an asset engaged in the securities services business,” IL&FS said in a statement.
Significantly, private sector lender IndusInd Bank was set to acquire IL&FS Securities Services and had signed a definitive share purchase agreement with IL&FS in June. However, sources said the new board approved by the NCLT and led by banker Uday Kotak has decided to cancel all past agreements undertaken by the earlier board of IL&FS.
“The money has not been transferred (by IndusInd Bank to complete the IL&FS Securities Services sale) and it has been decided that the sale process for ISSL will be re-started,” said a person close to the development.
IL&FS, in a statement, said the board has decided to publicly solicit Expressions of Interest to assess the interest for sale of its stake in both subsidiary firms — ISSL and ISSL Settlement and Transaction Services.
Any transaction for sale of asset will be subject to the NCLT, said the release.
“The board is taking steps for public solicitation in this regard,” it added.
The board also said these measures would help advance the process of putting together resolution plan(s) for the IL&FS group, based on market interest and price discovery for various assets.
It has also appointed Arpwood Capital and JM Financial as Financial and Transaction Advisors, along with Alvarez and Marsal as Resolution Consultants.
In a report submitted last month to the NCLT, the board had said it would work towards the final resolution, in stages and parts, over the next six to nine months.
It had pegged the overdue amounts relating to financial debt within the IL&FS group at about ₹4,776 crore. The financial sector, including banks, had an exposure of about ₹ 91,000 crore to the IL&FS group as of March-end."

28,2018-11-17,IndusInd,"Healthy core: IndusInd Bank
With public sector banks facing capital crunch and many non-banking finance companies weighed down by liquidity issues, leading private sector banks are set to gain. Access to low-cost deposits and ample capital to grow loan book should result in market share gains for sound private lenders, as NBFCs continue to grapple with rising interest rates and tight liquidity conditions.
IndusInd Bank has been a resilient performer, delivering strong loan growth over the last two to three years, even as other private peers witnessed slowdown in credit growth and rise in delinquencies. Over several quarters, the bank has registered 25-30 per cent growth in earnings, on the back of robust loan growth, more or less stable margins, and steady asset quality.
The stock has fallen by about 10 per cent since our last Buy call in the beginning of the year, along with the overall weakness in the market. This fall presents a good opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate the stock at current levels. At the current price of ₹1,497, the stock trades at 3.1 times its one-year forward book value, lower than its three-year historical average of 3.4 times (valuations had moved up sharply in the beginning of the year to 4.2 times). Given the strong loan growth and steady earnings expectation, investors can buy the stock with a two- to three-year time horizon. 
Notwithstanding the slowdown in credit growth within the banking sector over the last two to three years, IndusInd Bank has been able grow its loan book at a healthy 25-30 per cent over the past several quarters. The bank’s well-diversified portfolio has kept the loan growth in good stead. For instance, even as the bank delivered a modest 11 per cent growth in commercial vehicle loans in FY17, other segments within retail kept up the momentum in overall credit growth.
The steady uptick in commercial vehicle financing through FY18 (27 per cent growth) and in the first quarter of the current fiscal, has continued in the September quarter too, with the bank posting a 34 per cent Y-o-Y growth in this segment.
Tractor, equipment financing, and credit cards are other segments within retail that have grown at a robust pace in the latest September quarter. Corporate loans too have seen a strong growth of 35 per cent Y-o-Y, aiding overall loan growth.
Hence, the 32 per cent Y-o-Y growth in overall credit in the September quarter has been driven by a healthy traction in both corporate and retail loans.
The bank’s net interest margin, however, has been trending lower over the past few quarters. In the September quarter, NIM stood at 3.84 per cent, down from 3.92 per cent in the June quarter and 4 per cent in the same quarter last year. IndusInd’s relatively higher proportion of fixed rate loans (70 per cent) is one reason for the dip in margins, as deposit rates continue to rise. Also, pricing of deposits and liabilities have been faster than the re-pricing of the asset book; this has impacted margins. That said, the bank’s healthy share of low-cost CASA deposits and strong loan growth should keep margins within a narrow band.
The bank has also increased its benchmark lending rate — MCLR — by 40-45 bps over the past six months. As new loans are priced at higher rates and existing loan book gets reset, yields should move up in the coming quarters, aiding margins.
While the bank has been able to maintain a gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of around the 1 per cent over the past four to five years, certain aspects need monitoring.
The bank had made a contingent provisioning of ₹275 crore in the September quarter, pertaining to its exposure to IL&FS group. This may need some watching in the coming quarters, as additional provisioning/haircut on this exposure could impact earnings. Also, over the past year, steep bad loan divergences reported by banks has been a cause for worry. The divergence report for FY18 for IndusInd will be a key factor to look out for in the coming quarters. That said, what lends comfort is that the bank has been able to maintain good asset quality over the past several years. One-off spikes in provisioning aside, earnings growth should remain fairly healthy. Post the IL&FS crisis, the bank has also reviewed its NBFC portfolio and the management has stated that it is satisfied with the quality of its book.
The bank is also well-capitalised with Tier-1 capital ratio at 13.8 per cent as of September 2018. This should help it maintain a strong 22-25 per cent loan growth over the next one to two years, keeping earnings in good stead. IndusInd Bank had earlier entered into an agreement to acquire 100 per cent stake in IL&FS Securities Services. In a recent exchange filing, the bank has informed that the agreement stands terminated."

IndusInd Bank (Long)
CMP: 1,557.06
Target: ₹1,960
We recently met with the IndusInd Bank (IIB) management, and key takeaways were: a) IndusInd Bank remains comfortable with loan growth of 25-30 per cent; b) The bank is not eyeing portfolio buyouts at present; c) Pricing power has improved across segments; d) Excluding IL&FS exposure, asset quality remains steady; e) 2HFY19 provisions would remain elevated as IIB looks to prudentially set aside provisions towards its IL&FS exposure.
View: As non-food credit growth has inched up to 15.6 per cent y-o-y, IIB is set to be a key beneficiary given that NBFCs and select private peers likely go slow on incremental business growth. With banks such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI likely to have good penetration in most large corporate accounts, we believe IIB can further increase its wallet share in such accounts despite having 75 bps-100 bps higher MCLR rates. Maintain ‘long’.
Key risks: Increase in slippages and a slowdown in retail loan demand, especially from CV/vehicle segments."

Private sector lender IndusInd Bank posted a 5.2 per cent increase in net profits for the third quarter of the fiscal on high provisions due to exposure to debt-laden IL&FS.
Beating expectations, the bank’s net profits rose to ₹985.03 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, compared to ₹936.25 crore in the same period a year ago.
Its total income grew by 32.13 per cent to ₹7,232.32 crore in the October to December 2018 quarter, against ₹5,473.54 crore a year ago.
Net interest income of the bank also grew by 21 per cent to ₹2,288 crore in the third quarter of this fiscal, compared to ₹1,895 crore in the third quarter of 2017-18.
Fee income also rose by a robust 24 per cent to ₹1,469 crore from ₹1,187 crore a year ago. However, it was high provisions, at ₹606.68 crore in the third quarter of the fiscal, which dented the lender’s profitability. This was a 156.89 per cent increase compared to provisions of ₹236.16 crore a year ago.
This was largely due to a ₹255-crore provision for loans to IL&FS in the third quarter of this fiscal. IndusInd Bank had similarly made a contingent provision of ₹275 crore, along with a floating provision of ₹70 crore in the second quarter of the fiscal.
“The total provision for IL&FS is now at ₹600 crore. If required, we will make further provision in the fourth quarter. The resolution plan, in final form, is still to come, but we believe there are enough assets,” said Romesh Sobti, Managing Director and CEO, IndusInd Bank, underlining that the bank has had a strong quarter-on-quarter growth.
“Advances granted to various companies and SPVs belonging to a group in the infrastructure sector against certain identified cash flows and pertaining to specific assets are classified as ‘standard’ as of December 31, 2018,” the lender said in a regulatory filing, adding that it is closely monitoring the developments and implications of the resolution plan.
Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of the lender declined to 1.13 per cent of the total advances during the third quarter of the current fiscal, against 1.16 per cent at the end of third quarter. However, net NPAs of the bank rose to 0.59 per cent in the quarter from 0.46 per cent of the total assets.
IndusInd Bank shares gained 1.47 per cent on Wednesday and closed at ₹1,600.80 apiece on the BSE."

   -  PAUL NORONHA


 The ball is clearly in the RBI’s court. The regulator needs to decide soon on whether it will allow the re-appointment of the chiefs of private sector lenders IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank.
IndusInd Bank MD and CEO Romesh Sobti and HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri will both turn 70 next year, and retire in March and October 2020, respectively. They will not be eligible for re-appointment based on current RBI norms.
“The benchmark will be what happens in IndusInd Bank’s case. If the RBI agrees to Sobti’s re-appointment, then HDFC Bank could also send a similar proposal,” said a person familiar with the development.
Sources said initial feelers have been sent to the RBI for a possible exception to the rule though a formal proposal is yet to be sent. The banks may also engage in formal discussions in the course of this year.
In response to an email query by BusinessLine, IndusInd Bank said: “We do not wish to comment as the matter is speculative.” HDFC Bank, in its response, said: “Our stand on succession is in the public domain, and we wouldn’t like to add to it. Suffice to say that we have an appropriate succession plan in place.” 
With the RBI cracking the whip on private sector lenders such as Axis Bank and YES Bank, which have seen top-level changes, it is unclear whether it will relax its norms for IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank. 
Bankers have pointed out that private companies, unlike banks, can continue to have directors over the age of 70. Experts also believe that exceptions should be made for good performers. 
“Age is just a number. If a person is performing well then he/she should be allowed to continue in the role,” observed JN Gupta, MD, Stakeholder Empowerment Services. “However, succession planning is crucial for an organisation and it should be prepared for the exit of the CEO at any time.” 
Ashvin Parekh, Managing Partner at Ashvin Parekh Advisory, agreed. “Capability and age are not bound to each other. If a person has the ability to lead, he should be allowed to continue post the age of 70.”
Significantly, the RBI, in October 2018, had approved the re-appointment of Puri as MD and CEO for two years though the shareholders had approved it for five years.
Both Sobti and Puri are veteran bankers. Sobti recently expressed his keenness to continue if the RBI allows it. HDFC Bank has remained silent on the issue although Puri, in an analyst call last year, had said the process of appointing a successor would begin 18-24 months before his retirement."

Private sector lender IndusInd Bank reported a 62 per cent drop in net profit in the fourth quarter of 2018-19, largely due to its exposure to ailing Infrastructure Leasing and Finance Services (IL&FS), for which it made a provision of ₹1,274 crore in the quarter.
The bank’s net profit fell 62.2 per cent to ₹360.10 crore in the January to March 2019 quarter, against a net profit of ₹953.09 crore in the same period a year ago.
“In 2018-19, as well as the fourth quarter, while the bank has witnessed robust growth in its topline as well as in operating profits, aggressive one-time provisioning for a group exposure in the infrastructure sector depressed the bottomline,” said Romesh Sobti, Managing Director and CEO, IndusInd Bank. The lender has classified advances of ₹3,004 crore to the IL&FS Group, including ₹2,000 crore to IL&FS and ₹1,004 crore to operating companies and SPVs, as ‘non-performing’. An accelerated provision has been made, taking the provision against holding company exposure to 70 per cent and operating companies/SPVs to 25 per cent. The contingent provisions made as a prudential measure, at ₹275 crore during the second quarter and ₹255 crore in the third quarter, have been adjusted. In 2018-19, the lender made a total provision of ₹1,803 crore towards IL&FS.
Its gross non-performing assets also rose up to ₹3,947.41 crore, or 2.1 per cent of gross assets as on March 31, 2019, against 1.17 per cent a year ago. Its net NPAs also shot up to ₹2,248.28 crore, or 1.21 per cent of net advances as on March 31, 2019, compared to 0.51 per cent on March 31, 2018.
The bank’s total income grew by a robust 28.8 per cent to ₹7,550.43 crore in the fourth quarter of 2018-19 from ₹5,858.62 crore a year ago. Net interest income for the reporting quarter grew 11 per cent to ₹2,232 crore, against ₹2,008 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Net interest margin fell to 3.95 per cent in the fourth quarter. Non-interest income for the quarter grew 29 per cent to ₹1,559 crore.
BFIL merger
Sobti also expressed confidence that the proposed merger of Bharat Financial Inclusion (BFIL) with the bank is completely on track and that the order from the National Company Law Tribunal is likely after the vacation.
“The petition filed with the NCLT to sanction the scheme (merger) was heard on April 23, and the matter was reserved by the NCLT for final order,” the bank said.
Meanwhile, after its agreement for acquisition of IL&FS Securities Services was terminated, IndusInd Bank has made a re-bid for the company, said Sobti, adding that they have not heard anything from IL&FS on the matter.
Sobti also stressed the bank has been working on a succession plan roadmap for the last four years and has been grooming candidates. While he indicated his willingness to continue his association with the bank, he said it would be up to the RBI to review the age norms."
12,2019-06-12,IndusInd,"RBI unlikely to revisit retirement age for MDs and CEOs of private lenders


Private sector banks that have been hoping to get an extension for their chiefs after the age of 70 may be in for disappointment as the Reserve Bank of India is understood to be not amenable to the idea.
“There is a view that the current norms were formulated after much thought and discussion and have served the sector well. 
“The RBI may not accept a proposal to extend the age limit beyond the current 70 years, especially as it could be seen to be a one-off exception,” said a person familiar with the development, noting that the retirement age for public sector banks remains 60 years.
The issue assumes significance given that the MDs and CEOs of two private sector lenders – IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank – are due to retire next year.
IndusInd Bank MD and CEO Romesh Sobti will retire in March 2020, while Aditya Puri, who heads HDFC Bank, will retire in October next year when they turn 70. 
Following this, they will not be eligible for re-appointment based on current RBI guidelines.
Market experts believe that the test case may be IndusInd Bank, and if the RBI agrees to the re-appointment of Sobti, then HDFC Bank could also send a similar proposal. 
Sources said if at all the issue has to be revisited, it will be done with due process and as a policy decision, adding that as of now no concrete proposal has been submitted to the RBI on this issue. During the fourth quarter results conference of IndusInd Bank, Sobti had indicated that he would be willing to continue at the bank, but said it was up to the RBI to review the age norms. 
He had also said the bank was working on a succession plan roadmap for the last four years and has been grooming candidates.
Meanwhile, HDFC Bank, in its annual report 2018-19, has said the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the board would soon set up a search committee to scout for potential successors to Puri.
“With respect to the tenure of the current Managing Director ending in October 2020, the board will identify a successor and work to ensure that this is done in a manner that will allow appropriate time for an effective transition of responsibilities,” the annual report said."

We recently met IndusInd Bank for an update on the bank’s evolving business environment. Management indicated that the bank’s exposure of 1.9 per cent to stressed groups is expected to come down in the coming quarters. They also indicated that exposure to stressed housing finance companies (HFCs) included in the above limit is not material.
 In the NBFC space, the management believes that it is more of a ‘liquidity’ issue than a ‘solvency’ issue and expects limited impact for other large players given their strong liquidity buffers. Management remains confident on the quality of borrowers in its RE (real estate) book and expects the Tier 1 developers to get through the difficult times. 
Management does not see any stress in the gem and jewellery sector, specifically the diamond financing segment (where IIB has prominent exposure) despite the industry seeing some pressure in the jewellery segment. Management is confident of achieving a 20 per cent+ growth in the overall vehicle segment aided by market share gains from NBFCs.
 We believe the underperformance of IIB’s share price over the last year (27 per cent underperformance relative to Sensex) has largely been on account of concerns pertaining to its corporate book exposures and the sustainability of its fee-line."

Private sector lender IndusInd Bank has registered a 38 per cent rise in net profit for the first quarter of the current fiscal. The bank reported a net profit of ₹1,432.50 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, against ₹1,035.72 crore a year-ago.
The results include the operating performance of Bharat Finance Inclusion (BFIL), which has now been merged with the bank. A statement released by IndusInd Bank said the financial results for the period ended June 30, 2019 are not comparable with the previous periods.
The lender’s net profit in the previous quarter of January- March had dropped by 62 per cent to ₹360.10 crore, largely due to its exposure to ailing Infrastructure Leasing and Finance Services (IL&FS).
“During this quarter (under review), the bank has witnessed a healthy growth in its topline as well as in operating profit and will now push forward into the subsequent quarters basis our strong belief in new opportunities, especially in rural India,” said Romesh Sobti, Managing Director and CEO, IndusInd Bank.
Its net interest income grew a robust 34 per cent to ₹2,844 crore in April-June quarter against ₹2,122 crore in the same period a year ago. The net interest margin also improved to 4.05 per cent from 3.92 per cent a year-ago.
Non-interest income for the quarter under review grew by 28 per cent to ₹1,663 crore (₹1,302 crore).
The bank’s asset quality was stable, with both gross and net non-performing assets under control. Gross NPA stood at 2.15 per cent of gross assets as on June 30, against 2.1 per cent as on March 31, and 1.15 per cent as on June 30, 2018. In absolute terms, gross NPA rose to ₹4,199.66 crore for the first quarter of the fiscal, against ₹1,740.62 crore a year-ago.
Net NPA amounted to ₹2,380.51 crore or 1.23 per cent as on June 31, compared to 0.51 per cent a year-ago.
Its provisions rose 23 per cent to ₹430.62 crore in the first quarter from ₹350.01 crore a year ago. However, it declined from ₹1,560.69 crore in the fourth quarter of last fiscal.

9,2019-07-12,IndusInd,"IndusInd Bank starts fiscal on a positive note, but still early to gauge benefits of merging Bharat Fin 
The latest June quarter performance (standalone) of IndusInd Bank has been healthy, after a weak March quarter earnings impacted by the additional provisioning due to recognition of IL&FS exposure as NPA. Given that this is the first quarter which takes into account Bharat Financial Inclusion’s numbers — after the completion of the merger with IndusInd — the June quarter performance of the bank (consolidated) is not comparable to previous quarters.
Nonetheless, on standalone front, the bank’s performance is on a good footing. A 26 per cent y-o-y growth in loans, a 14 per cent growth in net interest income and an 18 per cent increase in net profit--it is a notable performance. While the growth in net interest income and profit is lower than its run rate of 20 per cent and above in the past (through FY18 fiscal and until the first half of FY19), the performance is sound given the persisting challenges in the sector.
Bharat Financial Inclusion (BFIL) was the largest microfinance institution (MFI) in terms of gross loan portfolio when the merger announcement was first made in October 2017. Synergies from the deal included increase in IndusInd’s market share in microfinance, boosting overall growth as well as higher yields and return ratios.
On a consolidated basis, loan growth stood at 28 per cent y-o-y in the June quarter. With the loan portfolio re-grouped, consumer finance division (that includes microfinance portfolio) constitutes 54 per cent of loans in the June quarter, up from 40-odd per cent in the past years. Microfinance itself contributes about 9 per cent to the merged entity’s loan book. In the June quarter, disbursements of BFIL saw a dip of 2 per cent y-o-y; the management explained that some of the slowdown was due to it turning cautious on overheated markets.
On the profitability front, margins and return ratios appear to have inched up post-merger. Net interest margin has moved up marginally to about 4 per cent in the June quarter, from 3.84 per cent in the March quarter (excluding IL&FS impact). Return on assets, too, has moved up to 2 per cent in the June quarter from 1.8 per cent in the March quarter.
It is, however, still early days to gauge the benefits of the merger. While the management is looking to leverage BFIL’s customer base for savings/deposits, how well it mobilises deposits from MFI customers is yet to be seen, given weak savings pattern within this segment.
A watch on the asset quality will also be important. In the June quarter, the gross NPAs have gone up marginally by about 6 per cent sequentially, forming 2.15 per cent of loans."

5,2019-07-24,IndusInd,"To extend gains, IndusInd Bankbets on Bharat Fin acquisition 


IndusInd Bank, India’s best-performing lender in the past decade, is counting on its acquisition of a microfinance firm to help it improve profitability, while shrugging off risks from the country’s NBFC crisis.
IndusInd’s purchase of Bharat Financial Inclusion will help it to move the needle on profitability parameters, including return on assets and lending margins, said CEO Romesh Sobti. Acquiring the nation’s largest micro financier gives the bank presence in more than 1.15 lakh Indian villages that will increase its cross-sell, lending, and low-cost deposit mobilisation efforts, said Sobti. 
Mumbai-based IndusInd, the stock price of which has risen 1,500 per cent since Sobti became CEO in 2008, lost some of its sheen after analysts, including those at Credit Suisse and UBS Group, flagged the lender’s exposure to beleaguered NBFCs that include Dewan Housing Finance. However, higher capital buffers and lower bad loans helped the bank sidestep the fate of rival YES Bank, which had lent to the non-banks, and saw its market capitalisation halve.
IndusInd’s exposures are way lower than what is projected in those reports and is backed by adequate collateral, said Sobti. “We are not expecting any spike in bad loans and are currently focusing on using the doorway offered to rural India through Bharat Financial.” IndusInd has been more selective in lending to non-banking financial companies of late. The bank’s net bad loan ratio stands at about 1.2 per cent, compared with 2.9 per cent at YES Bank. IndusInd’s return on assets rose to 2.1 per cent in June from 1.9 per cent in the year-ago period, filings show.
Still, there’s another risk looming for the bank, according to Morgan Stanley analysts – Sobti’s retirement in March. The CEO, who had quit ABN Amro Bank NV’s local unit to take the top job at IndusInd in February 2008, is credited with the turnaround that led to the surge in its shares, making it the best performer on the 10-member Bankex Index. The index climbed 200 per cent in the same period.
“There is no need for concern as the board has been applying its mind to this over the last four years,” said Sobti. “By the end of 2019, my successor will be in place, and there won’t be any disruption.”"

BL Research Bureau
A weak operating environment, increasing concerns over corporate defaults, and worsening credit risk situation has been dampening market sentiment in recent months. Against this backdrop, IndusInd Bank reporting higher slippages and a substantial increase in its SMA book (special mention accounts where payments are overdue by 1-90 days) in the latest September quarter, appears to have not gone down well with investors. Hence despite reporting a 21 per cent growth in loans, 32 per cent growth in net interest income and 52 per cent growth in net profit, the stock slipped by 6 per cent post the results announcement.
While the bank’s healthy margins, return ratios and capital adequacy are key positives, September quarter results suggest that surprises on the asset quality front cannot be ruled out, given the bank’s exposure to stressed sectors such as real estate. This is likely to weigh on the stock until the broader risk perception improves in the coming quarters.
 
At first glance, gross non-performing asset ratio which came in at 2.19 per cent of loans in the September quarter, only slightly higher than the 2.15 per cent the bank reported in the previous June quarter, does not throw up any concerns. But digging deeper it appears that few trends may need a watch in the coming quarters.
One, additions to bad loans has moved up in the September quarter---to ₹1,102 crore from ₹725 crore in the June quarter. Within corporate, slippages increased to ₹479 crore in the September quarter from ₹175 crore in the June quarter. A higher reduction in NPAs has offset the impact of steeper slippages, though. Interestingly, within retail too the bank has seen an increase in stress. As highlighted before, for IndusInd Bank, NPAs in credit cards that stood at 1.3 per cent in March 2017 inched up to 2.2 per cent as of June 2019 quarter and further to 2.4 per cent in the September quarter.
Two, the bank’s SMA book has gone up significantly. SMA1 (where payments are overdue by 31-60 days) is 0.38 per cent of loans up from 0.18 per cent of loans in the June quarter. Importantly, SMA2 (overdue by 61-90 days) book has increased to ₹1,143 crore in the September quarter from ₹324 crore in the June quarter. Some exposure to real estate, lease rental and NBFCs falling into the SMA2 book has been a key reason for the increase. The bank has stated that the ₹257 crore exposure to NBFCs under SMA 2 is expected to be fully recovered by October. Nonetheless, the broad increase in SMA 2 book needs a watch.
Three, the bank’s exposure to the three stressed groups in media, HFC and the diversified sector has been disclosed at 1.1 per cent of loans. Though the bank expects the exposure to reduce to 0.8 per cent by October, it may remain an overhang on the stock.
 Notwithstanding the slowdown in credit growth within the banking sector over the last two to three years, IndusInd Bank has been able to grow its loan book at a healthy 25-30 per cent over the past several quarters. In the latest September quarter, however, the loan growth came in lower at 21 per cent, which has also been a dampener of sorts. This is the second quarter which takes into account Bharat Financial Inclusion’s results as well, after the completion of the merger with IndusInd. With the loan portfolio re-grouped, consumer finance division (that includes microfinance portfolio) constitutes 55 per cent of loans, up from 40-odd per cent in the past years. Microfinance in itself now contributes about 10 per cent of the merged entity’s loan book. Despite the overall sluggishness in the commercial vehicle space, the bank’s credit to the segment grew by 14 per cent YoY.
While overall deposits grew by a healthy 23 per cent, there has been some moderation in CASA deposits. CASA ratio has dipped to 41.5 per cent in the September quarter from 43.1 percent in the June quarter.
The bank’s net interest margin, however, inched up by 5 bps to 4.1 per cent in the September quarter. IndusInd’s relatively higher proportion of fixed-rate loans, could be one reason for the increase in margins, as deposit rates continue to fall. The bank’s tidy share of fixed-rate loans can help it tide over margin pressure better than others, after the RBI’s mandate to link new floating rate retail and MSME loans to an external benchmark from October."

The management maintained the slippages were of ‘technical’ nature (hence upgraded), while a further recovery was expected in the SMA2 accounts and identified stressed accounts (one of which overlaps with SMA2). 
Overall, IndusInd Bank has added more stress in Q2FY20 with gradual recoveries over H2FY20E. The in-line core earnings were therefore a much needed consolation.

 In consumer banking, IndusInd intends to more than double the consumer banking client base (ex-Bharat Finance) over the next three years.
