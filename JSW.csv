49,2018-04-12,JSW,"JSW’s Vijayanagar steel plant faces heat as Mormugao terminal shuts operations
JSW Group-owned South West Port Ltd has stopped cargo handling operations at Mormugao Port Trust from April 1, after the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) revoked consent to operate the facility citing non-compliance with approval terms.
The two multi-purpose berths run by South West Port from 2004 play a key role in bringing raw materials and shipping finished products for JSW’s 12 million tonne (mt) steel plant at Vijayanagar in neighbouring Karnataka.
South West Port has filed an application with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) requesting permission to re-start the facility for handling 5.48 mt of cargo, the maximum volume set by GSPCB while granting permission to operate initially. South West Port, according to GSPCB, has been handling cargo in excess of this limit, sometimes even double the cap, posing health hazards to people of Vasco town. The excess cargo handled can invite a penalty of ₹5,000 a day.
South West Port has refuted the charge that handling more than the GSPCB cap was raising pollution levels since most of the cargo is evacuated by rail wagons. “We run the facility in a safe and clean manner. We don’t use road at all for evacuating coal; we use only rail,” a JSW official said.
Since shutting Momugao operations, JSW has been shipping its cargo through Krishnapatnam port and New Mangalore Port Trust, entailing extra costs. “Despite hardships, we are meeting the requirements of the steel plant,” the JSW official said.
“The steel plant is yet to feel the impact of the terminal shut down. But production could be impacted if a solution is not found soon,” said a steel industry official. JSW said its “first priority” is to get the Mormugao cargo via some other ports/terminals. “In parallel, our mergers and acquisitions team is in full swing, exploring potential opportunities in South India. We will pick the best option based on landed costs. Steel is not a high margin business. Logistics cost is a big component, so we will be impacted if the price is high. It will reduce our export competitiveness,” the JSW official said.
Port experts say that JSW’s acquisition options in the South are limited given the high revenue share some of the available facilities pay government-owned ports and huge asset valuations.
South West Port shares 18 per cent of its annual revenue with the Mormugao Port Trust, while other similar facilities such as the one at Kamarajar Port near Chennai, the revenue share exceeds 50 per cent. This was the main reason that led JSW to call off talks to buy the coal terminal run by Chettinad Group at Kamarajar Port which shares 52.524 per cent of its annual revenue with the government-owned port company."

The consortium led by Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Steel and AION Capital has received the letter of intent for acquiring the stressed asset of Monnet Ispat and Energy.
The committee of creditors (CoC) of Monnet Ispat and Energy, which is going through insolvency proceedings, had on Tuesday approved the resolution plan submitted by the consortium. Incidentally, the consortium was the only bidder for the bankrupt asset of Monnet Ispat.
The consortium was declared the successful resolution applicant by the Committee of Creditors of MIEL on April 10, and received a Letter of Intent dated April 12, said JSW Steel in a statement on Thursday.
“The consortium has accepted the terms of the LoI. The closure of the transaction shall be subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, including from the National Company Law Tribunal and the Competition Commission of India,"" JSW Steel added.
Earlier, ArcelorMittal questioned the selection of JSW Steel-led consortium as the winning bid for Monnet Ispat. Taking a swipe at JSW Steel promoter Sajjan Jindal in a tweet said: “Interesting what decision is being taken on Monnet today given it’s clear JSW runs afoul of (Section) 29A (of IBC) as they are related to the existing promoter….who is making the mockery here?""
In response, JSW Steel tweeted to say the company has gone through the rigorous scrutiny. 
After the thorough examination of facts, JSW Steel is declared as qualified resolution applicant as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code not only in Monnet but in other stressed accounts."
47,2018-04-12,JSW,"JSW dismisses ArcelorMittal’s allegations on eligibility 
The war of words between ArcelorMittal and JSW Steel intensified with the latter claiming that ArcelorMittal was questioning the wisdom of Resolution Professionals and the entire IBC under which JSW’s eligibility to bid for Monnet Ispat was confirmed. 
Reacting to ArcelorMittal tweet on Wednesday terming the selection of JSW Steel as winning bidder for Monnet Ispat as mockery, Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel, told BusinessLine that the company's eligibility has been tested and approved by the resolution professionals of two bankrupt companies Bhushan Steel and Monnet Ispat.
Whereas, he added, ArcelorMittal bid for Essar Steel has been rejected in the first round and is fighting a legal battle to prove its eligibility.
ArcelorMittal is trying to take out its frustration without getting its facts right and relying on some old data which has been clarified by JSW when the IBC was first made a law last year, he said.
A source close to ArcelorMittal said the main issue is about the need for consistency in how the IBC is applied. ArcelorMittal strongly believes that if JSW is eligible to bid for Monnet Ispat then ArcelorMittal should also be eligible to bid for Essar Steel,the source added.
Rao said JSW’s case is not similar to that of ArcelorMittal because neither has JSW Steel promoter invested in Monnet Ispat nor Monnet Ispat has any investment in JSW.
In the case of ArcelorMittal, Rao said its promoter has not only invested in bankrupt Uttam Galva but also signed agreement with banks as sponsor for Uttam Galva's loan. 
However, a judgment on ArcelorMittal eligibility is expected to be pronounced by NCLT on Monday, said Rao."
46,2018-04-15,JSW,"Essar battle: JSW says ArcelorMittal did not disclose facts on Uttam Galva
The battle to acquire Essar Steel is spiralling into a full blown war, with Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Steel accusing ArcelorMittal of suppressing facts related to the non-disposal agreement signed with lenders of Uttam Galva. 
Terming as illegal the move by ArcelorMittal, to transfer its shares in debt-laden Uttam Galva, Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel, told BusinessLine that the application for promoter declassification has a column seeking details on promoter's shares in encumbrance, pledge, lien, non-disposal undertakings. But ArcelorMittal had left this column blank when it sought to declassify itself as a promoter of Uttam Galva.
Being a promoter of Uttam Galva in 2011, he said ArcelorMittal had agreed not to sell its shares in Uttam Galva without the permission of a consortium of banks, led by SBI, that had provided a ₹1,400-crore loan to the latter.
“If ArcelorMittal had disclosed the agreement stock exchanges would have asked for a lenders' no objection certificate, which it would not have got without repaying the defaulted loan. The suppression of fact is not only a breach of trust, but also makes the share transfer illegal,” he said.
While SEBI norms permit transfer of shares within the promoters group, Rao said that this could have happened in this case had Uttam Galva not defaulted on its loan.
“ArcelorMittal is trying to take cover behind JSW Steel. It is drawing a parallel with JSW Steel's eligibility to bid for sick companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code by throwing out dissimilar facts,” he said.
ArcelorMittal denies
However, ArcelorMittal has denied the JSW Steel's allegation saying its disqualification in the first round of Essar Steel bidding was technical.
The company's spokesperson said: “The allegation made by JSW has nothing to do with the reason why the Resolution Professional deemed ArcelorMittal ineligible”.
“JSW is making that up. It was a pure technical reason as we had not yet been declassified (as promoter of Uttam Galva) then. Nothing else. Also, there is no breach (of law),” he added.
JSW Steel's fresh salvo against ArcelorMittal comes even as the Ahmedabad Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal is expected to deliver on Monday its ruling on the eligibility of both ArcelorMittal and Numetalfor Essar Steel bidding."

 The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) today asked the lenders of Bhushan Power & Steel, led by PNB, to consider the bid submitted by UK-based Liberty House for the debt-ridden company. Allowing the plea of Liberty House, the tribunal has directed the committee of creditors (CoC) to complete its resolution proceedings by June 23.
A two-member NCLT bench, headed by President Justice M M Kumar, said that Liberty House bid cannot be disqualified only on the ground of being submitted after the deadline of the resolution professional. “We hope that CoC takes an appropriate commercial decision as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC),” said NCLT.
The tribunal’s order came over a petition filed by Liberty House, challenging the rejection of its bid by the RP for Bhushan Power and Steel on account of late submission.
Liberty House had moved the NCLT on February 26 against the rejection.
The CoC had in February rejected Liberty House’s bid to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel, leaving Tata Steel and JSW Steel in the race for taking over the assets of the bankrupt firm. Liberty House had submitted before the NCLT that RP rejected its bid to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel without even opening the seal of its offer.
Bhushan Power and Steel owes about ₹45,000 crore to its lender."

Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel




Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel


Firing a fresh salvo, JSW Steel has written a letter to the Committee of Creditors on Monday to consider the option of calling fresh bids for Essar Steel as observed by the National Company Law Tribunal in its landmark judgment last Friday.
The Ahmedabad Bench of NCLT in its order had observed that resolution professional’s suggestion made to the CoC for inviting bids from all interested parties would have been a sound reasonable and legally transparent option keeping in view of amendment to Section 29 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code when the resolution plan was considered.
While asking the CoC to reconsider the proposals, the Tribunal observed the CoC may relook the option of recalling fresh bids as discussed in its March 21 meeting and take appropriate decision looking to time constrain.
Responding to this suggestion, Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel, in a letter to the CoC, said the lenders would have done a world of difference then if they had called for bids from all the interested parties rather than restricting it to companies that had submitted expression of interest in the earlier stage.
More competition would not only result in extracting higher value for the stressed asset but also bring in the much-needed transparency in the entire process, said Rao in the letter.
The meeting of CoC to consider the NCLT order was postponed to Tuesday, said sources.
Last month, JSW Steel had written a similar letter to CoC seeking permission to bid for Essar Steel without asking for any additional data, but it was reject as lenders did not want to re-do the entire process for inviting bids right from issuing advertisements in the newspapers.
Having been rejected, JSW Steel joined the race for Essar Steel in the second round by tying-up with Russian VTB Bank-promoted Numetal India consortium, but the NCLT on Friday order CoC to consider the first round of bids and gave 30-days’ time for both ArcelorMittal and Numetal to cure deficiency and prove their eligibility for bidding.
While presence of Rewant Ruia, Essar Steel promoter Ravi Ruia’s son, in Numetal consortium kicked up a controversy, ArcelorMittal bid was rejected as it was not re-classified as non-promoter of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, which had defaulted on their loan.
In order to become eligible, the Tribunal said the overdue amount to the lenders in both KSS Petron and Uttam Galva should be paid off by ArcelorMittal before being eligible to bid, as provided in Section 29A of IBC."
43,2018-04-27,JSW,"Consider our bid for Essar Steel, Vedanta tells Committee of Creditors


After JSW Steel, billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta has said that its bids placed for Essar Steel should be considered before a final decision is taken.
In a letter written to the Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel, Vedanta has said it would be really unfair on CoC’s part to reject the superior bid submitted by the company after a lot of effort even without considering. JSW Steel had also asked the Essar Steel lenders to consider its bid. 
Vedanta had placed its bid in the second round after the CoC rejected the initial bids of Numetal Mauritius and ArcelorMittal. However, the National Company Law Tribunal ordered the CoC to reconsider the first bid placed by Numetal and ArcelorMittal after providing them 30-day time to cure their deficiencies.
The Tribunal also asked the CoC to scrap the bids received in the second round. 
Second round
Earlier, JSW Steel — which had tied-up with Numetal in the second round of bidding — had written to CoC asking them to call for a third round from all interested companies.
It also questioned the CoC’s decision to restrict the second round of bidding only to companies that have placed Expression of Interest at the start of bidding process.
Meanwhile, the lenders of Essar Steel met on Friday but did not take any final decision. Some bankers are understood to have taken a view to go by the NCLT’s order to review the bids submitted by Numetal and ArcelorMittal. This could dampen the chances of Vedanta and JSW Steel. However, other bankers on the CoC are still in favour of inviting fresh bids. 
NCLAT hearing
In another development, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has agreed to hear on May 17 the petitions filed by Numetal Ltd and ArcelorMittal, challenging eligibility criteria. 
The NCLAT issued notices to a committee of Essar Steel creditors, the resolution professional running an auction of the company and the two bidders on the cross petitions. Russian VTB Bank-promoted consortium, Numetal Mauritius, had moved the NCLAT on Thursday claiming that ArcelorMittal should not be given 30-days time to cure its deficiency in order to be eligible for acquiring Essar Steel. 
Numetal alleged that Arcelor Mittal has placed bid for Essar Steel after the insolvency rules were amended to ban promoters with loan defaults from bidding for stressed assets."

 Indian steel stocks are not yet factoring in spread expansion, Macquarie says, adding that domestic steel prices will remain on an uptrend with further hikes in May 2018.
Deutsche Bank (DB) says Indian steel companies had raised domestic steel prices by $12-$15 per tonne in May 2018. It adds that rising domestic steel prices and declining raw material prices have resulted in Indian steel spreads increasing by 18 per cent over last three months.
Macquarie says stocks are not yet factoring in the spread expansion and upside risk in earnings. DB says rising spreads on the back of increasing demand will help domestic steel players achieve robust profitability and JSW Steel Ltd is its preferred pick in the sector.
Macquarie believes Tata Steel Ltd offers best risk reward, adding cost inflation impacts co the least. It adds with stronger prices and downtrending raw material prices, Q1 2019 margins could see another $20/tonne Q-o-Q expansion and drive the earnings upgrades.
Macquarie retains 'outperform' on Tata Steel and JSW steel; DB maintains 'buy' on JSW Steel. About 23 of 32 analysts covering JSW Steel rate it “buy” or higher with a median price target of Rs 323.50, while 25 of 30 analysts recommend 'buy' or higher rating for Tata Steel with a median price target of Rs 818.94, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The operational performance at the US operations of both the Plate and Pipe mill at Baytown and the US coal operations, have seen a consistent improvement during the course of the year. This has been supported by a strong economic outlook for the US. Consequently, the company during the quarter ended March has recognised a Deferred Tax Asset amount of ₹729 crore on the unused tax losses to the extent the US operations has sufficiently taxable temporary differences.

JSW Steel expects an additional earning of ₹2,000 crore per annum with enhancement of product mix and some of its cost saving projects that are to be completed by September next year. 
The company is setting up an eight million tonne per annum (mtpa) pellet plant and 1.5 mtpa coke oven facility at its Vijayanagar factory in Karnataka to reduce reliance on expensive iron ore lumps and bridge shortage of coke. 
Capacity addition
While the pellet plant is expected to be completed by August next year, the coke plant will go on stream in March 2020.
The company is also setting up a 0.3 mtpa colour coated line at Vijayanagar, besides enhancing capacity at Vasind and Tarapur plants.
Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel, said that with uncertainty on raw material prices increasing every month, the company has been taking all measures to protect the earnings with the focus on high margin products and cost saving measures.
The overall steel making capacity is also being increased to 24.7 mtpa from 18 mtpa by March 2020 through brownfield expansion with an investment of ₹44,415 crore.
Rao said the company will also take up plans to set up a 12-mtpa greenfield steel plant in Odisha after 2020.
Uncertain buys
Asked whether JSW has lost hopes on acquiring Essar Steel with such huge brownfield investment, he said the insolvency process appears to be a long-drawn battle with each case leading to litigation and that is exactly why the company has decided to focus on brownfield expansion which is a low hanging fruit.
There is also uncertainty over the company acquiring Monnet Ispat where it has emerged as highest bidder as the NCLT has raised some questions over valuation.
“We have nothing to do with the clarification sought by the NCLT. It is for the resolution professional and committee of creditors to decide on it now,” said Rao.
The company has started iron ore mining in one of its five mines in Karnataka and expects another mine to go on stream next fortnight. 
Vinod Nowal, Deputy Managing Director, JSW Steel, said the company will mine about 4.3 million tonnes of iron ore this fiscal against 22 mtpa required at the Vijayanagar plant.
Overall, the company requires 32 mtpa of iron ore, he added."

The iron ore mining major registered a total income of Rs 2,469 crore during the third quarter, down 1 per cent.




The iron ore mining major registered a total income of Rs 2,469 crore during the third quarter, down 1 per cent.


JSW Steel has blamed the high base price set for iron ore in the Karantaka e-auction as a major deterrent for sourcing the key raw material, contrary to miners’ claim of weak demand from steel companies in the State.
The Federation of Indian Mineral Industries recently decided to move the Supreme Court with an appeal to allow Karnataka iron mining companies export the ore to clear inventory. Some of the large steel companies in the State preferred to buy from Chhattisgarh and Odisha than an e-auction.
Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel said the lack of demand in the iron ore e-auction is due to the high base- price fixed by NMDC, the largest miner in the state.
Sourcing factors
In fact, he said it would be better for the steel companies to buy quality iron ore from Chhattisgarh and Odisha at a cheaper price than sourcing lower grade material at a higher price from the State. Compared to sourcing from Karnataka, JSW Steel has managed to buy ore with 64 per cent iron content at ₹ 600 a tonne cheaper from Chhattisgarh and ₹ 2,000 a tonne less from Odisha when value in use is taken in account, said Rao.
The iron content of Karnataka ore ranges between 58-60 per cent and needs beneficiation to improve its quality.
Base price
After the recent slowdown in offtake, some of the private miners in the State have reduced the base price by ₹400 a tonne in e-auction and managed to attract a few buyers. However, NMDC the largest iron ore producer in the State continues to charge a premium. T
the State-owned mining company had increased lump ore price by ₹150 to ₹ 3,050 a tonne and fines price by ₹100 to ₹2,660 a tonne in May despite the lack of demand, he added.
The high iron ore prices in Karnataka has led to many sponge iron ore manufacturers shut shop as they were being priced out in the market, said Rao.
Earlier, the Supreme Court had enhanced the iron ore production limit in the state to 35 million tonnes per annum from 30 mtpa due to higher demand."

South West Mining, the JSW Group promoter Sajjan Jindal-owned company, has bagged a mine with 40 million tonne per annum iron ore reserve at Bhangaon in Jharkhand.
The company plans to mine about two mtpa of iron ore after taking the requisite approvals. SWM, which will sell the ore in the open market, plans to start operations in 12-18 months.
Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel, said the mine is marked for merchant purpose and JSW Steel did not participate in the auction process.
Asked whether JSW Steel will sign any exclusive supply contract with South West Mining, Rao told BusinessLine that nothing of that sort has been worked out as yet as the feasibility of cost structure to transport iron ore from Jharkhand to the plant (at Vijayanagar in Karnataka) needs to be worked.
JSW Steel has its own plans to source captive iron ore from Karnataka and has bagged five C grade mines in the State, he said.
It plans to produce two mt of iron ore in the two mines that have started production and is expecting statutory clearances to start iron ore mining from the remaining three mines by December. The five mines is expected to supply 20 per cent of the company's annual iron ore requirement.
JSW Steel will invest about ₹300 crore in developing the five mines, said Rao.
As on June 18, the government has auctioned 41 mineral blocks valued at ₹1.86 lakh crore. The resources promise ₹1.48 lakh crore in revenue for the host States. The State governments will also get ₹33,100 crore as royalty and contributions by lessees to District Mineral Funds (DMF) and National Mineral Exploration Trust. 
Karnataka has seized the lead in electronic auctions followed by Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Maharashtra. 
Slurry pipeline
Last June, JSW Steel had approved an investment of ₹2,100 crore to set up slurry pipeline to transport iron ore, coal from coastal Karnataka to their steel plant at Vijayanagar works. 
Once installed, the pipeline will facilitate minerals’ transportation at about 15 per cent the cost of alternative means of transportation. 
The company will also be able to source nearly 50 per cent of its iron ore requirements from outside the State."

JSW Steel has announced plans to invest ₹40,000 crore in the next three years, even as lending rates continue to rise globally. Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel, in an interview with BusinessLine exuded confidence about the revival in steel demand holding and the company maintaining financial matrix despite huge capex. Excerpt:
How do see progress of NCLT cases in last one year?
All the issues relating to NCLT cases have revolved around two important points — intention of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), and Section 29A. If IBC is only for maximisation of asset value notwithstanding the process, then anybody can interrupt the process to place a higher bid. As of now, the judgment in different cases are contradictory. There needs to be clarity on whether Section 29A is directory or mandatory. If it is directory then defaulting promoters can also offer higher value. Unless these two issues are sorted, there will always be litigation and finally the Supreme Court has to take a call.
What is your view on changes being made in IBC?
The latest Ordinance allows lenders to withdraw insolvency cases if 90 per cent of them agree and certain conditions are adhered to. But the conditions to be met have not been prescribed. However, a press release issued in this regard states that cases can be withdrawn only before Expression of Interest is issued. Whereas, the Ordinance does not mention this. This issue needs a clarification from the government.
What is driving steel demand in India?
The economy looks better now as compared to last year. In May, steel demand increased 8.6 per cent. The demand is so strong that there is a concern on availability of steel. For the first time in last five years the demand has grown 1.2 per cent of GDP. Last fiscal, the demand used to be 0.4 per cent of GDP and at times it even lagged GDP growth. The demand has picked up in user industry after a long time. Now everybody has started expanding capacity. The government spending is also quite robust.
Will the rise in interest rate impact steel demand?
Increaseing in inflation and oil prices is not a good scenario. It will also have an impact on rupee-dollar value. However, steel demand and investment cycle is reviving after a long time. So a small increase in lending rate will not have make a big dent. But if oil prices continue to hike go up, rupee depreciates further, and inflation sustains at higher level it is definitely not a good sign. I do not think this situation will continue.
Will you review have relook at your capexwith as interest rate continue to risegoing up?
We have already factored in 40 basis points (0.40 per cent) increase in rates this year. Interest rates are increasing going up globally as well. We are raising fund on floating rate instead of locking our rates when it is increasinggoing up. Majority of our debt is being raised overseas. Raising interest rate may not sustain for long. Nearly 75 per cent of our debt is on floating rate. Yes, in absolute number our debt may increase because of capex, but we will always maintain our ratios. For instance we have guided debt to Ebitda ratio of 3.75 and debt to equity ratio of 1.75 and will adhere to this.
How do you see the global trade war impacting steel demand in India?
Any trade related decision by one country will lead to retaliation by the other. Whether it is good or bad only time will tell. These actions are required in unfair trade. The current trade war will have a huge impact on the global economy. I am not concerned about the fall in steel exports from India as long as there is no sharp rise in imports into India.
How do you compare India and US trade restrictions?
Indian trade restrictions are not comparable with the US. There is a 25 per cent duty on steel imports to the US. That is why HR coil prices in the US are higher by $250-$300 a tonne compared to $600 a tonne in other markets. India should work out safeguard duty.
Has the iron ore supply increased?
Iron ore demand in Karanataka is more than exceeds the supply. That is exactly why the prices in the sState is higher than Odisha or Chhattisgarh. Competitionveness of among steel companies in the State are is affected as compared to the companies in other sStates. We have requested mining companies including NMDC to adjustcorrect the prices. They have reduced the prices but more needs to be done.
Is it time to remove e-auction of iron in Karnataka?
Removing the e-auction is one of the request made by the industry and mining companies to Supreme Court. There was no checks and balances when the restriction was imposed. Today everything is computerised and closely monitored.there is a very close monitoring. The e-auctioned can be dispensed but Supreme Court has to take the call.
Are you looking at acquiring more mines?
Eight mines were suppose to be auctioned but clarification has been sought in the Supreme Court. Today, category 'C' mining is independent of Mining and Mineral Development Act rules, but now the government wants to align it with the Act which states that captive miners can sell 25 per cent in open market and use the rest for captive purpose. Currently category ‘C’ mine owners cannot sell in open market. Once this is settled more auction will take placehappen."

The recent rise in coking coal prices has made it viable for the company to restart production. Though JSW Steel will not import the coking coal produced in the US to India it will provide a financial hedge as it will be sold in the open market.
Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel, told BusinessLine that the US coking coal mine has started production and the plan is to ramp up production from 2.40 lakh tonne per annum to one million tonnes gradually.
Uptrend in price
Coking coal prices have increased to $200 a tonne from $76 in the last few years. With a strong demand and disruption in supply due to logistics issues there are no chances of it coming down any sooner, he added.
JSW Steel had invested $35 million to set up a prep plant (washery) with a capacity of 2.4 mtpa near the coal mine.
Going ahead, Rao said JSW would source raw coal produced by small miners in the neighbourhood wash it at the prep plant and sell it in the open market to reach the one-million-tonne target.
JSW Steel acquired the concession for nine coking coal mining in the US in 2010. These mines have total resources of 123 million tonnes and estimated reserves of 45 million tonnes in the area where drilling was already done.
Rao said that the company has no plans to restart iron ore mining in Chile that has been under care and maintenance for the last few years. 
Global scenario
Dwelling on global plans, he said the Group wants to have 10 mtpa steel production capacity in the US and Europe put together. 
“We have taken over 1.3 mtpa rolling facility in Europe for €80 million and will invest another €150-200 million in backward integration to raise its capacity to 1.5 mtpa,” he said.
The Group had already invested $150 million in modernising the existing one mtpa plate and pipe mill and another $350 million was pumped in for a slab making facility to complete backward integration at Baytown in the US.
“We have acquired 3 million tonne hot strip mill with one arc furnace and casting facility for $1 billion. These investments will take our capacity in the US to 4 million tonnes in two-three years, he said. 
In all, he added the Group had invested $1.5 billion to reach 5.5 mtpa capacity."

Sajjan Jindal, Chairman and Managing Director, JSW Steel




Sajjan Jindal, Chairman and Managing Director, JSW Steel


JSW Steel plans to merge Monnet Ispat & Energy with itself after turning around the company in the next one year.
Sajjan Jindal, Chairman and Managing Director, JSW Steel, said going by the Group’s past experience it normally takes about one year to turn-around an asset, so hopefully, Monnet will also turn positive in a year’s time.
“We will eventually merge Monnet Ispat into JSW Steel and it will be a JSW brand,” he said on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting here on Tuesday.
Last week, the National Company Law Tribunal approved a ₹2,875-crore bid by a consortium of Aion Investments and JSW Steel to acquire the bankrupt Monnet Ispat & Energy, which owes over ₹11,000 crore to lenders. 
Essar Steel asset
The Aion-JSW consortium was the sole bidder for the 1.5-million-tonne asset in Chhattisgrah.
Answering a question on the Group’s interest in the stressed asset of Essar Steel, he said the matter is in court and the NCLAT judgement is expected in the next two-three weeks.
“We have to wait and watch its outcome,” he said
In a bid to enhance production capacity and grow market shares in the domestic market, JSW Steel has tied up with Russian bank- promoted Numetal consortium to bid for the stressed Essar Steel asset.
Jindal pointed out that the company is also in the process of working to increase its presence in iron ore and coking coal mining.
“We are very constructive about the long-term growth potential for steel consumption in India. Even at a reasonable rate of growth of about 7 per cent per annum for the overall steel demand, India will need to create over 150 million tonnes of new steel capacity in the next 10 years,” he said.
However, he added global economies are increasingly stepping up protectionist trade measures to safeguard the interest of their domestic industries.
While this trend may continue in the future, it will not hinder JSW Steel ability to cater to the international markets. “This is because during the year we have selectively pursued some value-accretive acquisitions in the overseas markets with the strategic objective of replicating our low capital cost model in a relatively higher operating cost environment,” he said."

JSW Steel’s net profit in the June quarter increased almost four times to ₹2,339 crore against ₹624 crore logged in the same period last year, on the back of higher production and better realisation.
Sales were up 24 per cent at ₹19,950 crore (₹16,048 crore). Saleable steel output was up 9 per cent at 3.83 million tonnes in the quarter with sales in high margin automotive sector increasing 54 per cent.
Consolidated EBITDA per tonne of steel sold almost doubled to ₹13,570 (₹7,732), while on standalone basis it was ₹12,580 (₹6,269) on the back of better performance by the US and other subsidiary companies in India. 
Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, said the domestic demand for steel was up 9 per cent with strong demand from all the segments, including automobile, white and yellow goods companies.
With the sharp increase in domestic demand, the company reduced exports to 12 per cent of overall sales compared to 23 per cent in the same period last year.
Cheap imports
However, rising cost and increasing imports remain a major concern for steel companies with the possibility of surplus steel in global markets flowing into India as the US and Europe shut their borders on cheap imports, he said. Steel imports into India almost doubled to 4.50 lakh tonnes in the June quarter with shipments from Korea, Japan and China — the largest steel exporters to the US and Europe — doubling their exports to India, said Rao.
Steel imports from these three countries are about $20 a tonne cheaper compared to prices in India, while colour coated products were sold at ₹8,000-9,000 a tonne lower due to inferior zinc and colour coatings, he added.
As a precautionary measure, he said the government should impose a safeguard duty of $200 a tonne on all steel imports. This will be somewhat equivalent to 25 per cent duty imposed in the US and Europe, he added.
The overall debt of JSW Steel increased by ₹875 crore to ₹39,090 crore due to a 5 per cent rupee depreciation. The company has 40 per cent of its debt in foreign currency.
The company has received shareholders’ approval to raise ₹10,000 crore through private placement of non-convertible debenture and another ₹4,000 crore via non-convertible debenture with warrants that can be converted into equity."

Tata Steel and Liberty House, the incumbent lead bidders for the stressed Bhushan Power and Steel, will have to revise their bids upwards to stay in contention with the third-placed contender JSW Steel, which sprung a surprise by increasing its bid to ₹19,000 crore from ₹8,000 crore at the Committee of Creditors meeting on Friday.
The CoC has fixed July 31 as the last date for Tata Steel and Liberty House to revise their bids higher or ease out after JSW Steel increased its bid by ₹8,000 crore to ₹19,000 crore, said sources. The Tata group had offered ₹17,000 crore while JSW Steel had placed a bid of ₹11,000 crore on February 12, the last day for submission of bids. 
However, UK-based Indian business man Sanjeev Gupta-owned Liberty House offered to pay ₹18,500 crore up front 12 days after the deadline offered, surpassing Tata Steel.
Liberty House, whose bid was not considered by the CoC, moved the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.
On July 20, NCLAT directed the CoC to consider all three bids — Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW Steel — and submit the list of both the highest and second highest bidder so that the adjudicating authority could approve one in case of any problems with the first resolution plan in future.
The next hearing in the case is posted for August 1.
Bhushan Power & Steel, which has defaulted on ₹49,264 crore, is among the top 12 defaulters referred for insolvency proceeding by banking regulator RBI.
The conservative JSW Steel has entered into a bidding war in the insolvency proceeding for the first time, having lost the race to buy Bhushan Steel to Tata Steel. However, JSW Steel has bagged Monnet Ispat and has thrown its hat in the ring for Essar Steel.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court earlier this month directed NCLAT not to approve any resolution plan for Bhushan Power till it takes a call on the bidders’ eligibility norms.
Hearing a petition filed by Sanjay Singal, Chairman and Managing Director, Bhushan Power, the apex court clubbed a clutch of cases of a similar nature, including a petition by operational creditors to Binani Cement disputing the code’s constitutional validity, for joint hearing next month. Singal has challenged various Sections of the code including Section 29A, which disqualifies defaulting promoters from bidding for their own companies, as being ultra vires of a few articles of the Constitution.
If allowed to bid, they would come out with better bids than those submitted so far, he said."
30,2018-07-31,JSW,"JSW begins integration of Aferpi steel plant
 JSW Group has begun the operational integration of Aferpi, the specialised steel plant it recently acquired in Italy. 
As part of the integration process, Sajjan Jindal, Chairman, JSW Group, met the employees of Aferpi at a town hall organised in Piombino, Italy. He also met with government officials, including Enrico Rossi, the President of Tuscany province, and Massimo Giuliani, Mayor of Piombino.
Jindal, in a tweet, said the engagement with all the stakeholders of the newly acquired steel plant in Italy was fruitful and that the plant has the potential to be one of the best steel plants in the region.
The acquisition of Aferpi will help JSW expand its reach in the speciality steel long products market and provide a foothold for future opportunities in European markets.
JSW Steel Italy Srl, a subsidiary of JSW Steel, entered into a sale and purchase agreement last May with Cevitaly Srl to acquire 100 per cent of the shares of Aferpi SpA (Aferpi), Piombino Logistics SpA and 69.27 per cent of the share capital of GSI Lucchini SpA, for a consideration of €55 million on a cash free, debt free basis.
Aferpi makes and distributes special long steel products for rails, and wire rods and bars for railway, automotive and earth moving vehicles, among other products. At present, it is working on projects that involve production of 1 million tonne of long steel products and revamping of wire rod and bar mills, installation of one electric arc furnace of one mt capacity with two continuous casting machines. Besides, it is working on installation of a new rails- and beams-rolling plant and installation of the second electric arc furnace and the third continuous casting machine. JSW Steel is planning to increase its manufacturing capacity to 40-45 million tonne by 2030 from the present 18 million tonne."
29,2018-08-14,JSW,"JSW pips Tata Steel to bag Bhushan Power 
JSW Steel has pipped Tata Steel at the post to emerge as the highest bidder for the stressed Bhushan Power and Steel.
JSW Steel revised its bid from the earlier ₹19,000 crore to ₹19,700 crore on Monday, while Tata Steel surprisingly retained its initial bid of ₹17,000 crore. UK-headquartered Liberty House increased its bid by ₹500 crore to ₹19,000 crore, said sources close to the development.
Tata Steel had emerged the winner in the first round of bidding. But the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) directed Bhushan Power’s Committee of Creditors (CoC) to go for rebids after the other firms expressed a wish to increase their offers.
Tata Steel’s move
Tata Steel had appealed to the Supreme Court against the NCLAT decision to consider revised bids. However, the apex court refused to stay the NCLAT order.
The CoC will now submit the leading bids — of JSW Steel and Liberty House — to NCLAT, which will then approve the highest bidder’s proposal on August 17.
JSW Steel has also provided SBI’s guarantee to fund the acquisition.
With the buyout of Bhushan Power, JSW Steel will retain its position as the country’s largest private sector steel producer with a capacity of 22 mtpa while Tata Steel, with a capacity of 19 mtpa, will remain the second largest.
Tata Steel had earlier acquired Bhushan Steel through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process.
Stiff competition
JSW can now enhance Bhushan Power’s capacity quickly to 5 mtpa from 3.5 mtpa with an investment of ₹1,500 crore.
The gap between JSW Steel and Tata Steel will remain more or less the same even after the fresh capacity addition comes on stream over the next 5-8 years, according to industry experts.
Tata Steel had beaten JSW Steel to bag the 5 mtpa capacity Bhushan Steel with its bid of ₹35,000 crore. On the other hand, JSW Steel had bagged Monnet Ispat and Power for ₹2,800 crore.
Bhushan Power and Steel is a producer of flat and long steel products, with plants located in Chandigarh, Derabassi, Kolkata and Odisha."

 The uncertainties in the global market, which started with imposition of tariffs by the US on imports of steel and aluminium, have led to JSW Steel increase its focus on the domestic market. Therefore, though the consolidated quarterly sales of 3.91 million tonnes is lower by 1 per cent y-o-y, domestic sales grew at a healthy rate of 11 per cent compared to the same period a year ago. The company’s exports accounted for 17 per cent of the total sales in the quarter, down from 26 per cent in the year ago period.
JSW Steel’s consolidated revenue from operations increased by 25 per cent y-o-y to ₹21,552 crore in the September 2018 quarter. This is on the back of increased price realisations which have gone up by 25 per cent y-o-y aided by higher global steel prices and currency depreciation.
This along with a leash on costs helped the company to record higher operating margins in the quarter; this increased to 23 per cent from 18 per cent in the year-ago period. Higher sales in the high margin automotive segment (rise in volumes of 36 per cent y-o-y) also contributed to the growth in margins.
Sequentially though, operating margin reduced from 25 per cent in the June 2018 quarter to 23 per cent in the September quarter. This can be attributed to flat realisations and increase in the costs of key inputs like iron ore, coal, and natural gas.
The net profit in the quarter increased by 150 per cent y-o-y to ₹2,087 crore.
At the current run rate, the company is short of achieving its guidance of 16.75 million tonnes and 16 million tonnes per annum of production and sales respectively set for the current financial year. But the management expects to cover the shortfall in the second half of the year which is generally considered better for the industry.
With contribution from the recent acquisitions made in Italy and the US expected to start in the fourth quarter of the fiscal, there could be a boost to profits.
Also, the pipe conveyor at Vijayanagar which facilitates transportation of iron ore from mines to the plant is expected be commissioned in the third quarter of this fiscal. This pipeline conveyor that will replace truck transportation is expected to benefit the company to the tune of ₹300-500 per tonne.
Monnet Ispat taken over
Monnet Ispat has been taken over by the consortium of JSW Steel and Aion Capital in this quarter.

21,2018-11-11,JSW,"JSW Steel on a downward reversal mode
Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
What is the technical outlook for JSW steel for a time span of three months?
RT Rajasekaran
JSW Steel (₹347): The stock of JSW Steel has been on a long-term uptrend since late 2015. Intermediate-term trend is also up. However, the stock reversed direction after recording a new high at ₹427 in mid-September 2018. Since then, it has been on a medium-term downtrend. 
The stock currently tests a key medium-term support at ₹340. A strong break below this support can drag the stock down to ₹300. A further fall below the next support at ₹300 can pull it lower to ₹270 levels over the short to medium term. The long-term uptrend will remain intact as long as the stock trades above the significant support and trend-deciding level of ₹250.
 Investors with a long-term perspective can hold the stock with a stop-loss at ₹235. A break above the immediate resistance at ₹380 will strength in the primary uptrend and take it up to ₹400 and ₹430 in the long run.
 The stock now tests a crucial support, and the risk-reward is not favourable to take long positions. You can wait for a while and buy the stock at lower levels with a stop-loss at ₹290 levels. An upward reversal from the key support at ₹300 could keep it consolidating sideways in the ₹300-340 band.
What is the outlook for Granules India share bought at ₹117?
Sudhakar Reddy
Granules India (₹105.2): The significant long-term support in the ₹70-75 band arrested the stock’s decline in June 2018. Subsequently, it changed direction and has been in a medium-term uptrend since then. After taking support at ₹90, the stock continued to trend up. It now tests a short-term resistance and 200-day moving average at around ₹105. 
A decisive break above this level will strengthen the uptrend and take the stock up to ₹112 and ₹122 levels in the short to medium term. An emphatic breakthrough of ₹122 will reinforce the bullish momentum and take the stock up to ₹135 and ₹150 in the long term. 
Investors with a long-term perspective can buy the stock on a decisive break above the current resistance with a stop-loss at ₹88. On the other hand, a plunge below the key support at ₹90 will bring selling pressure and drag the stock down to ₹85 and ₹80 in the medium term.
I have bought shares of PC Jeweller at ₹145. Should I average, hold or book loss?
Krishna V Hegde
PC Jeweller (₹91.8): Since recording a 52-week low at ₹46.9 on October 26, 2018, the stock of PC Jeweller has been in the limelight and moving up. On Friday, it jumped 10 per cent with good volume, strengthening the near-term uptrend.
 But the stock faces a key resistance ahead at 100; a decisive break above this level will underpin the bullish momentum and take it to ₹120 and ₹140-150 band in the medium term. You can buy in dips and average the stock with a stop-loss at ₹77. Key supports are at ₹80 and ₹70.

Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Group is looking to set up a captive port at Pavinkurve in Karnataka’s Honnavar taluk with an investment of ₹2,000 crore. The port will meet the demand for its Vijayanagar steel plant, which is being expanded to 18 million tonnes (mt) from 12 mt, a company official has said.
“We have submitted a proposal, including a detailed project report, to the Karnataka government for setting up a captive port at Pavinkurve with a capacity to handle 15 mt of cargo,” a JSW Group official said, asking not to be named.
A spokesman for Karnataka’s Ports Department confirmed receiving the proposal from JSW Group. “We will scrutinise the proposal and implement the port project through the Swiss Challenge mode,” he said.
Under the Swiss Challenge method for suo motu proposals such as the one filed by the JSW Group, the State government will call for competing counter offers.
JSW will shall have the right of first refusal to match the highest bid submitted in the tender and develop the port.
“The entire 15 mt of cargo for the port will come from JSW only. There is no other cargo. It’s unlikely that anyone else will participate in the Swiss Challenge,” the JSW official said.
A new port is key to JSW’s plan to expand the capacity of Vijayanagar steel plant – India’s largest single location steel producing facility.
Even the new port will only partially meet the requirements of the expanded Vijayanagar plant.
Currently, JSW is meeting the logistics needs of the steel plant through two multi-purpose berths run by South West Port Ltd, a subsidiary at Mormugao Port in Goa.
At 4 lakh tonnes per month, South West Port is able to handle only 3.6 mt of coal a year or half the requirement of the steel plant. JSW is meeting the balance requirements through a terminal run by the Adani Group at Mormugao Port and partly through New Mangalore Port and privately-run Krishnapatnam port.
Having port facilities to handle in-house cargo will help JSW cut dependence on third parties in a business where logistics is a big and critical component."

JSW Steel plans to raise $500-600 million (₹3,500-4,100 crore) through issue of dollar bonds to part-finance its expansion plans.
The bond issue is expected to be announced early next week as the tenure, pricing and finer details are being finalised, said a merchant banker who is in the know of the development.
The road-show for the bond issue should begin by Tuesday, he added.
The company had embarked on a massive brownfield expansion programme with an investment to ₹44,400 crore by March 2020. The investment will create additional capacity of 6.6 million tonnes of crude steel and 3.3 million tonnes of downstream capacity.
JSW Steel will invest ₹15,000 crore this financial year and ₹14,687 crore in the next. Post the brownfield expansion, its capacity will go up to 24.6 million tonnes a year from 18 mtpa.
JSW Steel is taking several measures to rein in cost. It is commissioning an 8 mtpa pellet plant, a coke oven plant of 3 mtpa and a waste heat recovery boiler of 175 MW. The company has started iron ore mining from three captive mines in Karnataka and reduced dependence on imports and purchases from Odisha mines.
The company recently tied-up $700 million (₹4,900 crore) by signing the largest-ever trade finance for supply of steel over the next five years to Duferco International Trading Holding SA, a global steel trader and distributor.
The financing structure with Duferco International provides JSW long-term funding to complement its plans for future growth secured by committed exports of steel products to DITH.
Both the dollar bond and the trade financing will help JSW Steel fund expansion without much stress on its balance sheet, said an analyst.
Moreover, a committed export order will act as a natural hedge on the dollar funding and protect the exposure from rupee-dollar volatility, he said."

 Delays in the sale of assets under India’s bankruptcy law are becoming a key challenge for bidders who cannot wait indefinitely because of funding constraints, according to JSW Steel Ltd.
The Sajjan Jindal-run mill, which has bid for many companies under the insolvency law since sales of distressed firms began in 2017, is among bidders who have faced repeated delays in their attempts to buy indebted assets. A bidder has to tie up the capital for investing in an asset when submitting a resolution plan and it is not possible for any company, big or small, to keep the funding ready forever, said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of the steel mill.
“When I tie up the funding, I am incurring a cost. That cost cant be incurred indefinitely with so many uncertainties,” Rao said in an interview on Wednesday.
Since the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was passed in the Indian parliament in 2016, the resolution process has been slowed as courts are inundated with appeals from founders, administrators, lenders and bidders. Lenders to the first 12 companies brought to the insolvency court have lost out on Rs 4000 crores ($580 million) in additional income due to delays in the resolution process beyond the time mandated by law, according to rating company ICRA.
Almost 68 per cent of cases under the insolvency process had exceeded the 270-day deadline allowed as of December 31, with some of the cases going beyond 500 days, ICRA said in a January report.
JSW took over Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd in July after multiple company law tribunal hearings despite being the only bidder for the asset. It has also emerged as the sole bidder for another stressed steel products maker Asian Colour Coated Ispat Ltd, but the lenders and the professional in charge of the sale process have reportedly sought an extension of the deadline for submission of bids.
“It is surprising to us that the date for submission of resolution plans was extended several times. We are not able to understand that when there is a valid resolution plan, what is the need for seeking extension?” said Rao. 
The mill has also been selected as the preferred bidder for Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd and is awaiting the final nod from the tribunal. JSW had expressed interest in buying Bhushan Steel Ltd and Usha Martin Ltd, both of which were snapped up by Tata Steel Ltd. It also belatedly attempted to enter the race for Essar Steel India Ltd., when a second round of bids were called.
India’s insolvency process is reshaping its steel industry. Five companies from the sector were among the 12 large debtors -- the so-called dirty dozen -- ordered into bankruptcy court in 2017. Tata Steel’s bet on snapping up the assets of bankrupt mill Bhushan Steel has paid off as it overtook JSW as India’s biggest producer last year. Arcelor Mittal is inching closer to opening shop in the South Asian nation as its offer to buy Essar Steel was approved after months of court battles.
Economic growth is driving steel demand and pushing producers to scale up capacity. India’s steel demand is forecast to grow seven per cent to 7.5 percent this year, Rao said, driven by government expenditure on metro stations, water pipelines, bridges and affordable housing.
JSW expects to expand crude steel capacity to 24 million tons by March 2020 from 18 million tons now, and value-added capacity by 80 per cent to nine million tons, he said, adding that we are in the market to raise money to complete all these projects.
JSW is raising about Rs 3465 crores (i.e $500 million) through five-year overseas bonds to expand capacity. The company is tapping global markets as long tenure instruments in the Indian market are difficult unless the bond market matures, Rao said.
“It is a forced option. As JSW continues to expand capacity, the company will keep tapping global markets either through external commercial borrowing, export credit agencies or bonds to meet fund requirements in future,” he said."

The Karnataka government has agreed to execute the lease-cum-sale agreement on 3,666 acres with JSW Steel for setting-up Vijayanagar Steel Plant at Toranagallu village in Ballari district.
The Cabinet has also decided to cancel the agreement it had signed with Jupiter Aviation Services for the construction of Hassan airport over non-fulfilment of conditions.
Briefing reporters after a Cabinet meet chaired by Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said, “JSW Steel was allotted 3,666 acres of land in two instalments (2,000 acres and 1,666 acres) in 2006 and 2007.”
As per the lease-cum-sale agreement and subsequent review, the government has decided to transfer the land to the company. Looking at the land use and employment created by the company, the Cabinet on Monday decided to execute the lease-cum-sale of land in favour of JSW Steel.
“The company had purchased land — 2,000 acres at the rate of ₹1.22 lakh per acre and the balance 1,666 acres at ₹1.5 lakh per acre. In all, the company had paid ₹18 crore. Now the company has to pay the latest guidance rate,” said Krishna Byre Gowda. “The State Finance Department will calculate the difference and the company has to pay it,” he added.
The State Cabinet has decided to cancel the agreement with Jupiter Aviation Services for the construction of Hassan airport, said Krishna Byre Gowda.
The airport project was the brainchild of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda. The foundation stone was laid 15 years ago near Bhuvanahalli on the outskirts of Hassan city.
As per the plan, Jupiter Aviation Services had to build the airport and establish business links in Hassan, Chikmagaluru, Mysuru and Tumkuru. And to promote tourism locations in Hassan – Shravanabelagola, Belur and Halebidu. But, the project remained a non-starter.
Now, the Karnataka government is planning to give a new lease and build a low-frill airport by partnering with Airport Authority of India, which will have 51 per cent stake and the rest will be held by the State government.
“Today, the Cabinet decided to give impetus to the airport project. The State government is now planning to rope in RITES for preparing the detailed project report,” Gowda said."

 The BJP’s Karnataka unit on Tuesday alleged that the JD(S)-Congress government took a cabinet decision in a “hurry” to allot 3,700 acres of land at a cheaper rate to the JSW Steel plant in Ballari to “fill” their coffers and out of fear that they might lose power in the state. State BJP general secretary C T Ravi also claimed that the coalition government is on a “shaky ground” and a cabinet proposal on the JSW Steel plant was cleared on Monday. He demanded that the state government immediately stop this.
 “The Karnataka government has given 8,000 acres of land in Sandur, Ballari district, to JSW Steel plant in tranches since 1993. The land was given on lease. Yesterday, the cabinet took a decision to allow a sale deed for 3,700 acres at Rs 1.25 lakh per acre,” Ravi told reporters here.
 While the market value of the land near the steel plant is in the range of Rs 15-20 lakh per acre, the government’s decision to sell it at only Rs 1.25 lakh per acre is against the interest of the state, he said.
Following the cabinet meeting on Monday, Rural Development Minister Krishna Byre Gowda told reporters in Bengaluru that JSW Steel in Ballari was given 3,660 acres in 2005-06 on the basis of lease-cum-sale to set up a plant and infrastructure for employees. 
He had said as per the agreement, the lease had to be converted to sale after 10 years, which the cabinet approved on Monday.
The minister had also said any difference in the amount that the company needs to pay would be collected.
 
The decision was taken without looking into whether the company had met all the conditions such as the number of jobs created, jobs given to locals and the impact on the environment that were agreed upon in the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with the state government, he claimed.
The BJP leader also said the previous Congress-led government had deferred a decision on this matter as several cabinet members, including H K Patil, had opposed it. 
But, the cabinet had a taken a decision to give below 10 acres of land for sale and above 10 acres for lease alone, he claimed.
 “Now, the JD(S)-Congress government has taken the decision in favour of Jindal. I suspect corruption in crores... this should be stopped immediately,” he said, adding that Patil has shot off a letter to the government opposing the cabinet decision."
13,2019-06-08,JSW,"JSW Steel: It’s a steal
The stock price of JSW Steel is down 9 per cent since our last ‘Buy’ call in January 2018. This can be attributed to the turmoil witnessed in the metals industry in the last one year, caused by the US imposing a 25 per cent tariff on import of steel products into the country.
Given the company’s strong fundamentals, the fall in the stock price presents a good buying opportunity.
JSW Steel’s ability to cater to the rising demand, its cost-control measures and stable financials make the stock attractive.








 
 
At ₹262, the stock trades at about nine times its trailing 12-month earnings; lower than its three-year average of 17 times. Though costlier than its rival, Tata Steel, which trades at 6 times its trailing 12- month earnings, JSW Steel’s growth prospects make it attractive.
It needs to be noted that earnings growth will revive only from FY21, as commissioning of new capacities and impact of the company’s various costs-saving initiatives will come into effect after FY20.
Hence, long-term investors with moderate-risk appetite can consider buying the stock at current levels.
The prospects of the global steel industry look healthy in spite of signs of slowdown in the economy. China’s steel production increased in 2018, despite the ongoing US-China trade stand-off, to meet increasing global consumption demand.
Domestically, too, the growth in steel industry is expected to be robust, with increase in demand from segments such as pre-engineered buildings, engineering, railways, and other government-aided infrastructure projects. In the last two years — FY18 and FY19 — steel consumption in India grew by 7-7.5 per cent annually and is expected to grow at an average rate of above 6 per cent over the next few years.
Major steel companies in India are already running at higher utilisation rates and the output is mainly consumed domestically with only a portion (about 10 per cent) exported. Around 10 per cent of the domestic demand is met through imports currently.
Given this supply constraint, only capacity additions can cater to the increasing demand for the metal.
The domestic market contributes 85 per cent of JSW Steel’s sales volume. JSW Steel has about 14 per cent market share in the domestic steel industry and is well-placed to capitalise on the growing demand, with its ongoing capacity expansion projects.








 
The crude steel production capacity at Dolvi plant is being expanded from 5 million tonnes (mt) to 10 mt, which is expected to commissioned by the end of FY20. Also, the revamping of blast furnace-3 at Vijayanagar plant; modernisation-cum-capacity enhancement at downstream facilities of its subsidiary — JSW Steel Coated Products — is expected to give a leg up to the production.
Thus, though the guidance for the volume growth for FY20 is subdued at 1.5 per cent Y-o-Y, it is expected to pick up to more than 8-10 per cent from FY21, as majority of the expansions would be completed by the end of FY20.
JSW is focussed on overcoming its cost-disadvantage in its key raw material, iron ore, when compared to Tata Steel. Currently, JSW Steel procures its iron ore mainly from external sources, while Tata Steel sources it from captive iron ore mines; this brings down the cost.
JSW Steel has now operationalised three iron ore mines and started using captive iron ore to an extent, thereby reducing dependency on imports or domestic purchases.
Out of a total requirement of 32 mt of ore, 5 mt is expected to be derived from captive sources by the end of FY20. (In FY19, the company used 1.35 mt of iron ore from captive sources). The company is set to bag more captive iron ore mines by participating in the auctions that would be held before March 2020.
This is expected to reduce the additional outgo on iron ore procurement in periods of low availability (cost could go up to ₹600 per tonne in such periods).
Various cost-saving measures taken earlier will yield results from FY20. For instance, its 20 km pipeline conveyor for transportation of iron ore to the integrated Vijayanagar plant from the mines — that was commissioned recently — will benefit the company to the tune of ₹300-500 per tonne.
The company expects to transport 11 mt of iron ore in FY20 through this conveyor.
The company’s financial performance has been stable in FY19 despite slowdown in automotive sector, tight liquidity and fall in steel prices during the year.
The consolidated revenue and the net profit for the year grew by 16 per cent and 23 per cent to ₹84,757 crore and ₹7,524 crore respectively. The operating margins, too, improved to 22 per cent from 20 per cent from one to two years ago.
Production at both the international subsidiaries — JSW Steel (Italy) S.r.i. (Aferpi) and JSW Steel USA Ohio Inc (Acero) — are steadily ramping up and are expected to turn positive at the operating profit level by the end of the FY20.
All the Indian subsidiaries contribute to the group’s operating profits except the recently-acquired Monnet Ispat, which is expected to turn positive in six months to one year time.
Net debt is a point of concern as it jumped sharply from ₹38,000 crore in FY18 to nearly ₹46,000 crore in FY19 due to capex and acquisition of Monnet Ispat, US and Italian units. Acquisition of Bhushan Power would further increase the debt levels for the company.
However, despite debt increase in absolute terms, the key metrics such as net debt-to-equity improved from the previous year and stands at 1.34 time Key risks include steep fall in steel prices, possible increase in debt and hence finance costs that could put pressure on the margins."

Investors with a short-term perspective can sell the stock of JSW Steel at current levels. The stock has been in an intermediate-term downtrend since registering a new high at ₹427 in September 2018. Medium as well as short-term trends are also down for the stock.
In early May, the stock encountered a key resistance at ₹310 and continued to trend downwards. While trending down, the stock conclusively breached its 21- and 50-day moving averages and has been trading well below them.

   -  Bloomberg


 India’s steelmakers, more accustomed to securing raw materials such as iron ore and coal, are keeping another key resource in their sights: water.
Two of India’s biggest steelmakers - JSW Steel and Tata Steel - and metal producer Vedanta have flagged risks due to water shortages in the past month as the world’s second-most populous country faces an unprecedented water crisis.
Competition for the resource is set to grow in India, where nearly a third of the country is water-stressed, increasing costs and risks for companies. A delayed monsoon, which accounts for 70 per cent of the nation’s annual rainfall, has exacerbated the situation this year.
The urgency surrounding water supply risks is not lost in our discussions with companies, but the talking is still happening behind closed doors, according to Damandeep Singh, director at CDP, which runs a global disclosure system for companies and others to report environmental risks. The problem is that when companies in India get water, they get it cheap. There’s no incentive to manage a resource when it is available so cheap.
Water is shaping up to be a serious economic risk in Asia’s third-largest economy. Desertification, land degradation and drought cost India about 2.54 per cent of gross domestic product in 2014-15, according to a study last year by Indias environment ministry. In a global survey of miners, just under half the respondents reported financial impact worth $11.8 billion over five years thanks to water-related problems such as droughts, increased water stress and flooding, according to a 2018 report from CDP.
Indias second-biggest steel mill JSW Steel has built a new water reservoir with 1.3 thousand million cubic feet storage capacity at its plant in the water-scarce southern state of Karnataka to ensure adequate supply for uninterrupted operations, the Sajjan Jindal-owned company said in its annual report on July 4.
Top producer Tata Steel is also investing in sewage treatment plants to process water for reuse and creating new rain water harvesting structures to improve the groundwater table. Water is used as a coolant in the steel making process and over 3 cubic meters of freshwater is required per ton of crude steel produced, it said in the annual report last month.
Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta performed a water risk assessment at 25 of its most significant business locations and found that its operations in Rajasthan, Punjab and Tamil Nadu had a greater risk of shortages than elsewhere because of competitive pressures for water usage in those regions, the Mumbai-based company said in its annual report last month.
About 600 million Indians are facing high-to-extreme water stress and the situation is set to worsen as water requirements rise, according to a 2018 report by NITI Aayog, the governments policy making body. Water demand is expected to be twice the available supply by 2030, implying severe water scarcity for hundreds of millions of people and an about 6 per cent loss in India’s gross domestic product, it said.
Greater demand for resources and extraction of mineral reserves in often water-scarce locations, where stable supply of water is no longer guaranteed, continues to jeopardize existing and future operations, according to CDP. Companies including miners have been taking water for granted for the longest period, CDP’s Singh said. They are still taking an ostrich-in-the-sand approach."

CMP: ₹230.35
Target: ₹300
Some key points of Q1: a) Consolidated revenue for Q1 FY20 came in at ₹19,812 crore (down 11.4 per cent y-o-y), fall in
revenue was primarily on account of around 11 per cent fall in domestic steel prices.
Standalone steel volume for the quarter was at 3.75 mt (down 2.1 per cent y-o-y) and realisation was at ₹46 664/t (down 5.76 per cent). Coated products business did volume of 0.45 mt (up 4.7 per cent y-o-y) and realisation was at ₹66,444/t (down 5.7 per cent y-o-y).
We continue to remain positive on JSW Steel led by significant capacity addition in progress, cost cutting measures, increase in captive iron ore volume (expected to be around 5 mt in FY20 versus 1.8 mt in FY19) and its ability to alter between export and domestic sales. However, over near term slow down in auto industry and reducing spread due to falling steel prices and raw material prices remaining at the same level will be a concern. 
We have reduced our FY20 EBITDA/PAT estimate by 11 per cent/24 per cent as we factor in higher operating expense but maintain our FY21 estimate. We value the stock at ₹300 (7x FY20e EV/EBITDA) and maintain ‘buy’.

b) Lower than expeted volume growth."
8,2019-08-04,JSW,"Results Tracker: Will external risks weigh on JSW Steel's strong fundamentals?
Amid domestic weak demand from user industries such as automotive sector, construction and infrastructure, and unfavourable global factors, JSW Steel’s June quarter performance was sombre. The company’s net profits fell by about 57 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹1,008 crore in the latest June quarter.
The stock has fallen by about 10 per cent in the past week, post the results. Lingering concerns over domestic demand and rising raw material cost, are likely to keep the stock under pressure in the coming quarters. Add to this, Trump’s imposition of new tariffs on China impacting commodity prices, can dampen realisations, affecting profitability of all steel companies, including JSW Steel.
That said, JSW Steel is among the better-placed in the sector to weather the volatile environment. Focus on cost-saving measures and value-added products aiding margins, acquisition of iron ore mines mitigating rising ore costs and expansion plans, should hold it in good stead in the long run.
JSW Steel standalone recorded sales volumes of 3.75 million tonnes in the June quarter, down by 2 per cent from a year ago. To mitigate the sluggish domestic demand, the company shifted its focus to the overseas market; share of export sales increased to 17 per cent in the June quarter from 12 per cent last year.
The company stated that delay in payments made by the government to contractors, also led to weaker demand (fresh), impacting the company.
 










 
Weak realisations, too, dampened revenue, which fell by 8 per cent to ₹17,499 crore in the first quarter of FY20. The realisation per tonne in India has fallen to ₹46,664 from about ₹49,500 a year ago.
In addition, weak demand, especially from the automotive industry (which is high-margin business for JSW Steel), and rise in iron ore prices (key raw material) by more than 50 per cent Y-o-Y, have led to a drop in operating profit margins from around 25 per cent a year ago to 21 per cent in the quarter.
Meanwhile, the contribution from the company’s subsidiaries is also not impressive. While the Indian subsidiaries have shown decent performance, overseas ones such as Ohio in the Mingo Junction and the European operations, were impacted by unfavourable global factors; overseas subsidiaries reported operational loss of ₹265 crore for the quarter.
Seasonally, the first half of the year is generally weak for the steel sector; hence, the company’s weak performance is expected to continue in the second quarter of the fiscal too. Growing concerns on domestic economic growth and increasing volatility in the global factors can add to the pressure.
However, the company’s long-term prospects are sound.
 










 
At the sector level, opportunity for Indian players due to lower exports from China and Indian government spend on infrastructure such as Railways and affordable housing, remain healthy.
For JSW Steel, in particular, cost-savings measures can help cushion earnings. The company started using the conveyor belt to move iron ore; this has led to savings of ₹155 per tonne on about 10,000-15,000 tonnes of ore transported each day. The company plans to increase transportation of ore on conveyor belt to 30,000 tonnes per day in the next three to four months.
JSW Steel is now sourcing nearly 5 millon tonnes of its total iron ore requirement of 55 mt from its captive iron ore mines; this insulates the company from the rising ore costs. The company is active in participating in the new iron ore mine auctions and recently obtained few mines that could increase captive sourcing of ore to 7-8 mt in the current fiscal.
The company is also on track in completing the capacity expansion at Dolvi plant at Maharashtra, to 10 mtpa from the current 5 mtpa; this is expected to be completed by March 2020. The expansion at Vijayanagar plant in Karnataka by about 1 mt, is to be completed soon.
On the inorganic front, the company’s plan to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel is in the final stages."

6,2019-10-20,JSW,"Q2 outlook bleak for steel firms
The results season is here and market players are ready for some serious number crunching. In order to understand Q2 results of the top steel players, one should first look at earnings and the operational numbers of three private players – Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSPL (steel business ) in Q1.
During the second quarter, the global steel demand was muted, and it weighed on steel prices across geographies, including India. The fall in prices of raw materials — iron ore and coking coal — gave some relief though.
The April-June quarter of FY20 was an unpleasant period for steel players operationally. The net profits of Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSPL in Q1 fell by 63 per cent, 57 per cent and 33 per cent respectively compared to profits in the year-ago period.
This was led by weak growth in sales volumes, lower realisations and a steep rise in raw material costs. While the revenue growth of companies — in the same order mentioned above was — 1.27 per cent, -3.4 per cent and five percent y-o-y, operating profits fell by about 14 per cent, 27 per cent and 2 per cent y-o-y.
According to ICRA India, domestic consumption of steel in July and August, at about 16.98 million tonnes, was muted. The consumption in the corresponding months of 2018 was 16.39 mt.
This is reflected in the sales volumes recorded for September quarter by Tata Steel. While the group’s sales volumes at 7.03 million tonnes grew by about 5 per cent sequentially, it fell by 3 per cent compared to Q2 of FY19. 
While JSW Steel did not release their sales figures for the quarter, the management, in an interview with BusinessLine, stated that the demand for the commodity continued to be under pressure in the last few months with weak demand from the automotive sector.
Beating the trend, JSPL reported 10 per cent y-o-y growth in sales volume in Q2. Its resilience against the cyclicality could be on account of higher exposure (nearly 60 per cent) to rail steel and other value added products.
Data from ICRA reveals that steel prices in the first two months of the second quarter were lower by ₹7,000-₹8,000 per tonne compared to last year. 
One concern is that the prices are lower by ₹2,700-₹4,800 compared to the average steel prices in the first quarter of FY20. 
Meanwhile, a look into the trend of iron ore and coking prices show that they have softened in the September quarter. Consumption cost of coking coal may come down by $4-$5 per tonne. The import cost of iron ore came down from above $100 level in Q1 this fiscal year to $80-$90 per tonne towards the second quarter end.
Tata Steel has pointed out that gains from lower cost will benefit the company only in the coming quarters. With low volumes, weak realisations and reduced cost benefits, the operating profit and margins could be under pressure in Q2. 
JSW Steel has stated in earnings concall of Q1 that consumption cost of both iron ore and coking coal will be lower in the September 2019 quarter. While this could help preserve margins, good growth in operating profit in absolute terms is unlikely. For JSPL, margins will be under pressure but a 10 per cent volume growth would limit the contraction in operating profit."

BL Research Bureau
Given the subdued economic activity, the earnings of JSW Steel for the quarter ended September 2019 was expected to be weak. Revenue for the company fell by about 18 per cent to ₹17,572 crore, while net profit fell 73 per cent to about ₹560 crore (even after adjusting the tax reversal made on account of recent corporate tax rate cut) when compared to the same period a year ago.
Moderate sales volumes, lower realisations, lag in the transmission of reduced costs exerted pressure on the profitability of the company.
Going ahead, the operating performance of the company depends on the implementation of proposed investment initiatives by the Government, possibly lower imports from FTA (Free Trade Agreement) countries, and stability in the steel prices which hinges on the resolution of Brexit imbroglio and trade issues between the US and China.
 According to ICRA India, domestic consumption of steel in July and August, at about 16.98 million tonnes, was muted. The consumption in the corresponding months of 2018 was 16.39 mt.
This is reflected in the sales volumes recorded for the September quarter by the steel companies. JSW Steel is not an exception. The group’s sales volumes at 3.56 million tonnes in the September quarter fell by about 3 per cent sequentially, and by 9 per cent compared to Q2 of FY19.
This is despite the company trying to counter the slowdown in the domestic demand with the increase in exports by almost 68 per cent to 1.09 million tonnes, which accounted for about 31 per cent of the consolidated steel sales.
The reason for the slowdown in the domestic demand for steel and lower steel prices was attributed to the muted investment spend, credit squeeze and a slowdown in the automotive sector.
Though exports compensated the loss of sales from the domestic market to an extent, it couldn’t help the company much on the realisations front. Steel prices across the globe have been falling due to uncertainties in global trade.
The net sales realisation of the company, which was about ₹43,000 per tonne in the second quarter of FY20, was down by about 13 per cent Y-o-Y and about 8 per cent on a sequential basis. The fall in the share of value-added products – commanding higher margins – in the overall sales, to about 46 per cent from 55 per cent in a year-ago period, have also likely weakened the net blended realisations of the company in the September quarter.
 A look at the trend of iron ore and coking prices show that they have softened in the September quarter. According to ICRA India, the import cost of iron ore came down from above $100 level in Q1 this fiscal to $80-$90 per tonne towards the end of the second quarter, though it is higher than the cost in the year-ago period. The average import cost of coking coal, however, dropped from about $180 per tonne in Q2 FY19 to $160 per tonne in Q2 FY20.
The management of JSW Steel stated that it would benefit from the reduced costs of raw materials only in the ensuing quarters due to the lag effect.
While JSW Steel managed to cut down its other operating costs in the quarter, weak realisations and higher raw material costs impacted the operational profitability of the company adversely. For the September quarter of this fiscal, JSW Steel recorded operating profit of ₹2,731 crore, down by 44 per cent compared to a year ago.
This also led to the drop in EBITDA margins to about 16 per cent in the latest September quarter from about 22 per cent a year ago.
 After a robust FY19 fiscal, the company has started the current fiscal on a subdued note. The management expects the second half of FY20 to track the first-half performance. It is hopeful of meeting 97 per cent of the production and sales volumes’ guidance – 16.95 million tonnes and 16 million tonnes respectively - fixed for FY20.
Going ahead, if the investment proposals of the Government in the pipelines and solar appliances segments are implemented, and if the credit flow is improved, demand could improve for steel companies.
Besides, if steel prices stabilise –the company believes that the commodity’s price has bottomed out – and benefits of the lower cost of coking coal and iron ore flow in, there could be some respite on the margin front, aiding earnings."
4,2019-11-25,JSW,"JSW Infrastructure opens Paradip iron ore terminal


JSW Infrastructure Ltd, the port operating unit of Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Group, opened a new 18 million tonne (mt) capacity iron ore terminal at Paradip Port Trust on Monday mostly to handle third party cargo as it moves from a captive port operator to a commercial operator.
JSW commissioned its new terminal at Paradip by loading approximately 60,000 metric tonnes of iron ore pellets on the bulk carrier MV IC Phoenix for one of the country’s leading pellet manufacturer, Brahmani River Pellets Ltd.
JSW Infrastructure was awarded the rights by Central government-owned Paradip Port Trust to develop a fully mechanised iron ore export terminal on a Build, Operate and Transfer (BoT) basis for 30 years. The company invested about Rs 750 crore to build the facility. The 370 meters’ long terminal is designed to handle capsize vessels for iron ore and pellet exports and can load 100,000 metric tonnes per day.
The high load rate is expected to significantly reduce the pre-berthing delays at Paradip as well as allow incremental cargo flow to the Port. The terminal has two ship-loaders, each with a capacity of 7,000 metric tonnes per hour. It also has an 800,000 metric tonnes cargo storage yard with rotary and tandem wagon tipplers to enable fast rake unloading. 
Ports run by JSW Infrastructure at Jaigarh and Dharamtar in Maharashtra and in Goa and Paradip have a combined capacity of over 100 mt and handled a combined 65 mt of cargo in FY19 of which some 90% were the Group’s own cargo.
“By 2025, the captive cargo and third-party cargo mix would be 50:50,” said Arun Maheshwari, Joint MD and CEO of JSW Infrastructure. “We are moving from a dependent port to an independent port operator,” he told Business Line on October 11.
JSW Infrastructure aims to build a port capacity for handling 200 mt by 2022 and 300 mt by 2025 to help handle 215 mt of cargo. Of this, more than 100 mt would be Group cargo and the balance would be third-party cargo.
“The Group cargo is my break-even; that’s my comfort and advantage,” Maheshwari said. Third party cargo would come mostly from the just commissioned iron ore terminal, a new 30 mt coal terminal which will open next year at Paradip Port Trust, 10 mt from Jaigarh port and another 30 mt from other facilities, he said.
“With the commissioning of the iron ore terminal, JSW can now offer cape size shipments from Paradip Port. The capacities are far better than not only any other Indian port but also many ports internationally. The most modern, fully mechanized and environment-friendly terminal will enable minimal handling loss for our customers with faster turnaround. This will help boost competitiveness of customers as well as Paradip Port. This terminal is part of our broader strategy to achieve 200 mt cargo handling capacities in next three years. We will achieve our capacity target through a mix of greenfield and brownfield expansions,” Maheshwari said."

Notwithstanding the nagging controversy and protest over the new Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Sajjan Jindal, Chairman, JSW Group has come in support of the Act and said in a young country new laws have to be understood before being opposed. This Law will protect the country from illegal immigrants and will place Indians first, irrespective of their caste and religion, he said.
On the opposition from students against the Law, Jindal said he hopes that students know what the Government is trying to do to protect the integrity and the standing of this great nation.
The idea of a strong India is important and it is sad that the students are getting sucked into politics, he added.
The amended Citizenship Act makes it easier for the non-Muslim immigrants from India's three Muslim-majority neighbours — Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan — to become citizens of India.
It entitles Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians facing religious persecution in the three nations to seek Indian citizenship, highlights the exclusion of Muslims.
Government has cleared the apprehension that the Act will trigger fresh migration of Hindus from Bangladesh by stating that Hindus population in Bangladesh has declined sharply from 28 per cent to nearly 8 per cent now.
Further, the cut-off date of December 31, 2014 and benefits under CAA will not be available for members of the religious minorities who migrate to India after the cut-off date.
The Act does not apply to tribal areas of Tripura, Mizoram, Assam and Meghalaya because of being included in the 6th Schedule of the Constitution.
Also areas that fall under the Inner Limit notified under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873, will also be outside the Act's purview."

Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Steel plans to close the deal to acquire Vardhman Industries for ₹127 crore by December-end as it has received the clarification sought from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
The company also expects the acquisition of Asian Colour Coated and Bhushan Power and Steel, to be completed by the March quarter.
Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel told BusinessLine that the clarification given by NCLAT in the case of Vardhman Industries is very satisfactory and the fund will be transferred by this month end.
As per the approved resolution plan, JSW Steel will infuse ₹63.5 crore in Vardhman Industries through equity shares or debt within 30 days from the date of NCLT order. It will pay ₹62.5 crore to financial creditors while operational creditors will get ₹1 crore.
Vardhman Industries manufacture galvanised tubes, coils, precision steel tubes, corrugated steel tubes, cold rolled steel sheets and others.
Asked whether the government is more receptive to foreign companies as it provided immunity to ArcelorMittal promoters for acquiring Essar Steel quite fast by amending the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code while JSW Steel has been waiting for over six months, Rao said “I do not think so. As and when we raised the issue they listened. First it was thought that we are trying to delay the deal, but our stand was vindicated when Enforcement Directorate attached the asset under PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act)”.
Now, the attachment of asset has been stayed by the Supreme Court. It is not the question of who is raising the issue, but whether it is genuine or not is to be seen, he said.
The Government has already introduced the IBC amendment bill in the Parliament and in the Budget session it will be passed, he said.
The case will be upfor hearing in NCLAT on January 13 for the first time after IBC amendment and the court will also take up the case filed by the CoC in February. The issue has been addressed at the highest level, said Rao."

It has been one of the worst year for the debt-laden steel sector. Leading steel companies are caught unaware amid large capex spend and demand falling to a new low. BusinessLine spoke Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel, on the outlook for coming year. Excerpts:
What is the outlook for the steel sector in the coming year?
We think things have bottomed out. We started the year with 8.8 per cent growth the previous year. The first quarter steel demand growth was 6.4 per cent, then it was 2.4 per cent and then in September it went into negative territory. In October it became marginally positive and improved there on. The cumulative growth in first eight months of this fiscal was 3.56 per cent.
The slowdown in growth was quite visible in the later part of the year from June. The main reason for the slowdown was the lack of credit from banking system and cut in government expenditure. The Government has taken a series of measures to address the issue. Now, credit growth touched 6.5 per cent. Banks’ balance sheet will get strengthened by recovery in big NPA accounts and they will be in a position to lend. The recovery momentum will catch pace. We expect the March quarter to be better than December quarter.
Do you expect a revival in the manufacturing sector?
Today, capacity utilisation is low in the manufacturing sector. At least this should see an improvement if the demand picks up. Today, credit growth from March has tapered off. Credit to the steel sector, in particular, has been coming down quarter after quarter, because of the bankers’ past experience in lending to this sector. They have become risk averse when we want 160 million tonne of capacity in India.
I think some policy calibration is required on lending in general, and specifically to the steel sector for both working capital and long term finance.
How will the steel prices be in the new year?
China is the main driver of steel prices. The Chinese Iron and Steel Association has recently said in the first 11 months of this year, Chinese steel companies operating profit has come down by 34 per cent. This means, at the current prices it is difficult for the Chinese steel companies to make money. The development has led to huge supply-side adjustment.
Steel production globally was 163 million tonne in May. Of this, Chinese companies have produced 89 mt. After this, the steel industry has suffered due to high raw material prices and a fall in demand and steel prices. In November, global steel production had fallen to 147 mt and that of Chinese was 80 mt. So about 15 mt of production cut, and on annualised basis, the supply was lower by 180 mt.
The drastic adjustment on supply-side means that it is not easy for many companies to make money at the current level."
