332,2018-02-15,State Bank,"Some SBI customers see a/cs shifted to other branches without prior consent
If you have an account with State Bank of India (SBI), it’s time you double-checked the address of your branch.
In an unprecedented move the bank has been shifting some accounts from existing branches to other locations without prior information or consent.
“I was shocked to see a text message from SBI that my account has been shifted from the RP Road branch to Secunderabad with a new IFSC code. I feel I should have been asked for my consent,” a businessman, who did not want to be identified, told BusinessLine here on Thursday.
Our enquiries have revealed that accounts of many customers have been shifted and information was sent to them only after the process was over. While the top executives of SBI preferred not to respond to queries from BusinessLine, the information gathered from the branches revealed that the process was taken up nationally in view of the merger of the associate banks with SBI last year and the drive to contain operational expenses.
Not happy
The customers, however, are unhappy.
“We open accounts based on a variety of factors such as proximity and ease of transactions.
You cannot simply shift my account as per your choice,” complained V Viswanatham, an SBI customer whose account has also been shifted.
Many retail customers and businessmen regularly conduct cash transactions and, hence, proximity of branch and the time taken to complete transaction are factored in while choosing branches.
The ‘unilateral’ shifting of branches may work against this, he added.
SBI is containing operating expenses by “continuing rationalisation of administrative offices and branches” as per the recent presentation on the third quarter ended December 31, 2017.
The number of branches were reduced to 22,584 from 24,017.
The rationale behind rationalisation is not only cost-cutting but also promotion of digital channels.
The share of branch transactions decreased to 21 per cent in December 2017 from 25 per cent in the year-ago period.
There is a continued migration of transactions to digital channels.
From 36 per cent (up 8 per cent year-on-year) share now, the target is 65 per cent in the medium term, SBI said.
But what remains to be seen is whether this move will distance SBI from the common man who still prefers to use branch-based cash transactions?"

State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Friday clarified that the bank has no direct exposure to the controversial diamond dealer Nirav Modi, but admitted to some transactions with Punjab National Bank in this case.
PNB has reportedly been defrauded of ₹11,300 crore through fraudulent issuance of letters of undertaking in a scam whose dimensions are still unfolding.
‘Onus on PNB’
On the sidelines of a press meet in Kochi, Rajnish Kumar revealed that the SBI has over $200 million exposure to PNB connected with the LoU transactions with Modi; of this, $90 million was made through SBI’s Mauritius subsidiary.
“Our exposure to PNB alone was $212 million. There has been absolutely no lapse on our part and we have followed all standard operating procedures. The onus is now on PNB and we are confident of fully recovering the amount.”
The Chairman was clarifying SBI’s position that it would contest PNB’s claim that the 30 banks who are involved were also responsible as they did not follow due procedure.
Earlier, he said banking is a risky business and banks adhere to certain regulations to manage those risks. “How you manage the risk is vital. If there is a breach of trust, banks have several areas for detection like surprise checks, regular audits, and so on.”
Rajnish Kumar was here in connection with the opening of the bank’s Global NRI centre.
SBI has undertaken elaborate risk-management practices and has an internal audit system which is well-recognised, he said. One of the practices is job rotation from sensitive positions every three years. SBI’s exposure to the gems and jewellery sector is hardly 1 cent of disbursements, he said.
“The notion that the majority of the loans goes to the corporate sector is wrong. Of the total loan portfolio, 60 per cent is retail,” he added.
Meanwhile, the CBI on Friday registered an FIR against Modi’s uncle Mehul Choksi and his Gitanjali Group of companies based on a February 13 complaint by PNB. The FIR, according to sources, named three companies owned by Choksi — Gitanjali Gems, Gili India and Nakshatra Brand.

 The country’s largest lender SBI today said it has an exposure of $212 million (about Rs 1,360 crore) in respect of a letter of undertaking issued by Punjab National Bank to Nirav Modi, but does not have any direct exposure to the absconding jewellery designer. “We don’t have any direct exposure on Nirav Modi but we do have some exposure on Punjab National Bank,” State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar told presspersons here today.
He said the bank has lent $212 million to Modi on the basis of an LoU issued by PNB. Kumar, however, said the bank has some exposure to Gitanjali Gems, owned by Mehul Choksi, uncle of Nirav Modi. “Our exposure to Gitanjali is small we and we are not worried,” Kumar said.
When asked about the lender’s exposure to the entire gems and jewellery sector, he said it is less than 1 per cent of the total domestic loan book. “My domestic loan book is Rs 16 lakh crore and gems and jewellery sector exposure is less than Rs 13,000 crore, which is less than 1 per cent,” he said. He said the bank is careful as far as the gems and jewellery industry is concerned and has been taking steps to put a lot of risk mitigation measures for accounts from the sector.
He said SBI has an elaborate system of risk management and internal audit and the robustness of that system is well recognised. “One of the risk management practises we follow is job rotation. We don’t keep a person for more than three years at one position. There are certain positions which are sensitive and we monitor those positions closely,” Kumar said.
He said the Swift system and the core banking system in SBI are integrated. Banking is a risky business and risks are of various nature such as credit risks, operational risks, market risks and foreign currency risks. “Operational risk is always an unknown risk. Credit risk a calculated risk ... you know during the appraisal about the probability of default,” he said.
Banks need to manage the risks by creating awareness about the risks, having standard operating procedures, strict compliance of these procedures and having a strong oversight. “Ultimately, we are human beings who do the transactions and banks run on trust. But, if there is a breach of trust by any individual, you have to have a process for detection,” he said.
Review of the risk assessment processes and plugging of gaps should be a continuous process banks need to do. Talking about Axis Bank selling exposure, he said, “They might have sold to other banks but whether we have bought or any other bank has bought, ultimately the exposure is on the bank that issued the letter of undertaking."

In an another statement, SBI said it does not have any direct exposure to Nirav Modi (accused in the Punjab National Bank fraud), but only marginal exposure with PNB."

 The largest lender State Bank today raised its lending rates by 0.20 percentage point (20 basis points) to 8.15 per cent, with immediate effect, setting the tone for the industry to follow suit.
This is the first lending revision by the bank since April 2016 and comes a day after it massively raised the retail and bulk deposit rates.

State Bank of India has upped interest rates on domestic retail term deposits (up to Rs 1 crore) by up to 50 basis points across tenors with effect from today. With India’s largest bank hiking retail deposit rates, other banks are likely to follow suit.
The maximum increase of 50 basis points is in four maturity buckets – 7 days to 45 days; 2 years to less than 3 years; 3 years to less than 5 years; 5 years and up to 10 years.

325,2018-03-03,State Bank,"Borrowers play fraud on SBI; misuse car loan for producing Tamil film 
 In yet another fraud on a public sector bank, as many as 13 persons including a kabaddi player got a loan of ₹ 3.29 crore for buying top-end cars, but ‘misused’ the money for producing a Tamil film.
 When the fraud came to light, the Madras High Court, on a plea from the State Bank of India (SBI), granted an interim injunction against the movie’s release.
The fraud was done with the connivance of an auto loan counsellor who allegedly hacked the bank’s computers to facilitate the loan sanction and its disbursement.
 Justice C V Karthikeyan passed the interim order on a civil suit of the lender restraining White Screen Productions (WSP) from releasing the movie till March 16, 2018.
 The production house is represented by kabaddi player Raja and he is among the 13 borrowers.
 According to the SBI, 13 persons including Raja of WSP got a total loan of Rs 3,29,71,000 for purchase of various types of cars.
 The loan papers were submitted through an auto loan counsellor, D Chitra, who handed over the relevant documents including the KYC (know your customer) of the applicants to the lender.
 According to the bank, Chitra gained confidence of the branch officials and got acquainted with the loan sanction and disbursement norms. She submitted misleading facts and dubious documents to the authorities.
 Through fraudulent methods, she accessed the operating system of the computers by hacking the user ID and password of the officials.
 Also, she fraudulently diverted the loan amount directly to the borrowers instead of crediting it to the account of the car dealers.
 Subsequently, the loan proceeds were misused for film production by the borrowers and no cars were purchased by the people who procured loans through her.
 Fraud comes to light 
During a routine check, SBI’s branch manager at Velachery in the city found abnormalities in the loans recommended by Chitra and on verification noticed irregularities in such loan accounts and reported the matter to higher authorities for further probe.
 On investigation, it was noticed that Chitra had hacked the URL of Loan Originating Software.
 Though the high court directed the police to register a case against all the 13 borrowers, including the producer and actor of the film, the police did not act and hence, the bank filed a civil suit, the bank submitted in its plea.
 In its suit, the bank had sought an injunction to restrain the producers who are all the debtors from releasing the movie.
 The PSU lender had also sought a declaration from the court that it is entitled to have a ‘first charge’ from the sale proceeds of the movie and rights over the film like DVD and satellite rights."

SBI (₹253.1)
 As expected, SBI fell breaking below the 200-week moving average (₹260) support last week. The stock tumbled to a low of ₹244.4, but managed to recover some of the loss before closing 3.6 per cent lower for the week. The crucial support at ₹245 is holding well as of now. Since the stock has been falling continuously over the last few weeks, as long as it sustains above ₹245, a corrective rally in the short term cannot be ruled out. A strong break above the immediate resistance in the ₹258-₹260 zone can trigger this corrective rally, targeting ₹270 in the short term on the back of profit booking. But if SBI fails to breach ₹260 and remains below it, a revisit of ₹245 is possible. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹245 and ₹260 can be seen for some time. The stock will come under renewed pressure if it breaks below ₹245 decisively. Such a break can take it to ₹238 initially. Further break below ₹238 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹205 or ₹200 over the medium term.
 








 
 
ITC (₹259.4)
ITC fell breaking below the key support level of ₹262 last week. Though the stock has bounced from its intra-week low of ₹253.4, the muted price action of this recovery move indicates lack of strength. Strong resistance is in the ₹263-₹266 region. ITC should surpass ₹266 decisively to ease the downside pressure. In such a scenario, the stock can rally to ₹270 and ₹275 again. But the indicators on the chart suggest a lower possibility of the stock breaking above the ₹263-₹266 resistance zone. Immediate support is at ₹257. A strong break below it can drag the stock lower to ₹250 in the coming days. A break below ₹250 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending towards ₹244. Further fall below ₹244 looks less probable at the moment. Short-term traders can go short on rallies at ₹262 and ₹265 with a stop-loss at ₹268 for the target of ₹252. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹259 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹256. Long-term investors, on the other hand can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220.
Infosys (₹1,163.4)
Though, Infosys is stuck in a sideways range for more than two weeks the price action keeps the bias positive. Inability to break above ₹1,169 can keep the stock range-bound between ₹1,130 and ₹1,169 for some time. But a decisive break above ₹1,169 can boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹1,200 initially. It will also increase the possibility of the stock breaching the psychological ₹1,200 mark and targeting ₹1,250 or even higher levels over the medium term. The 21-day moving average at ₹1,138 and a trend line at ₹1,130 are the key supports to watch. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below ₹1,130 decisively. Such a break, though less likely, will increase the possibility of the stock falling towards ₹1,110 and ₹1,100 in the short term. The region between ₹1,100 and ₹1,085 is a strong support for Infosys. A strong fall breaking below ₹1,085 is unlikely as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at lower levels and limit the downside. Both long and medium-term investors can hold the long positions.
RIL (₹912) 
 RIL fell sharply last week after failing to extend its up-move beyond the key resistance at ₹960. The stock tumbled over 6 per cent intra-week and made a low of ₹888.3. However, it managed to bounce from this low recovering some of the loss and closed 3.7 per cent lower for the week. The broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range within which the stock has been trading over the last few months, remains intact. The immediate outlook is unclear. Cluster of moving average (21-, 100- and 55-day moving average) resistances are poised in between ₹922 and ₹928. If RIL manages to break above this resistance cluster, it can rally again towards ₹950 and ₹960 — the upper end of the range. But inability to break above the ₹922-₹928 resistance zone and a pull-back move in the coming days can keep the stock under pressure. In such a scenario, RIL can fall below ₹900 and test ₹880 and ₹870 — the lower end of the range. Traders can continue to stay out of this stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges.
Tata Steel (₹605.6)
Contrary to our expectation, Tata Steel tumbled breaking below ₹630 last week. The stock plummeted 10 per cent in the past week and the stop-loss levels on the long positions have been breached. The uptrend that has been in place since 2016 is under threat now and initial signs of a trend reversal are emanating on the charts. The stock has closed below the 200-day moving average for the first time in two years. Cluster of resistances in between ₹635 and ₹650 can cap the upside. Intermediate bounces may find fresh sellers coming into the market at higher levels in the above-mentioned resistance zone. As long as the stock remains below ₹650, the outlook will remain bearish and a fall to ₹580 cannot be ruled out. A strong break below ₹580 will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹555. Short-term traders can go short on rallies at ₹630 and ₹650. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹685 for the target of ₹560. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹605 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹585."

""....Our bank also offers its customers the option to shift from regular savings bank account to BSBD account on which no charges are levied.”
The bank clarified that the customer has the option of converting the regular savings bank account to a Basic Savings Bank Account (BSBD account) free of charge, in case he desires to avail of basic savings bank facilities without being subject to maintenance of AMB."
316,2018-03-13,State Bank,"PSU bank stocks rise on PNB compensation hopes, easing rate woes


Bank of India was the top percentage gainer on the Nifty PSU Bank index that rose as much as 5.7 per cent.




Bank of India was the top percentage gainer on the Nifty PSU Bank index that rose as much as 5.7 per cent.


 Shares of state-run banks rose on Tuesday after a report said Punjab National Bank will compensate lenders who have lost money in the alleged Nirav Modi fraud, and as easing inflation data allayed fears of a policy rate rise.
Retail inflation eased for the second straight month in February but remained above the 4 per cent medium-term target of the Reserve Bank of India. Analysts from Citigroup and Nomura said they expect the central bank to hold rates in the near-term following the new data.
The sector also got a boost on news that Bank of India recovered about Rs 7,000 crore ($1.08 billion) that had earlier been categorised as bad loans. It also expects to recover a further Rs 2,000 in another two months, the Hindu Business Line reported. 
The bank’s shares surged as much as 15 per cent, its biggest intra-day percentage gain since October 25. It was the top percentage gainer on the Nifty PSU Bank index that rose as much as 5.7 per cent.
PNB shares rose as much as 8.5 per cent, the stock's highest intra-day percentage increase since late October.
The stock had fallen 41 per cent as of Monday's close since Feb. 14, when the company first revealed the mammoth amount involved in an alleged fraud that was initially pegged at $1.77 billion and later revised to over $2 billion.
“If there is a sizeable recovery in one bank then, it helps sentiment and also hopes of other banks recovering,” Yuvraj Choudhary, an analyst at brokerage Anand Rathi, said.
A media report, citing sources, said that PNB will honour claims by peer banks who issued credit to jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi against guarantees given by PNB, but with a few caveats. PNB, the second-biggest state-run lender, has alleged that a few bank officials colluded with Modi and Choksi's firms to issue fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs) and allow them to raise loans from overseas branches of mostly Indian banks.
Both Modi and Choksi have denied wrongdoing, and so have two key accused PNB employees in the case, dubbed as India's largest ever bank fraud.
PNB did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
State Bank of India, the country's largest lender by assets, rose 3 per cent while UCO Bank and Allahabad Bank jumped 4.7 per cent and 9.3 per cent, respectively. These banks are among lenders who have extended credit based on the LoUs issued by PNB.
A senior banker at one of the banks that has lent to the jewellery groups based on the PNB guarantees that have allegedly turned out to be fraudulent said discussions were ongoing on who will take the liabilities, but it was “premature” to comment on an outcome.
“We are talking. But then we have not come to a conclusion,” said the banker, who did not want to be named, adding that PNB has not yet provided concrete assurances of repayment."

 India’s largest lender SBI and India Mortgage Guarantee Corporation (IMGC) today signed a pact to offer mortgage guarantee scheme for prospective non-salaried and self-employed home loan customers.
The offering will help increase home loan eligibility up to 15 per cent within the regulatory norms, the State Bank of India (SBI) said in a statement.
“With the rising demand in affordable housing segment, this product aims to provide home finance to select target audience at better terms,” it said, adding that SBI would be the bank to provide mortgage backed home loan product to non-salaried class.
“MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) between SBI and IMGC is a strategic initiative which will enable us to improve housing loan volumes in non-salaried segment.
Under this product applicant can avail higher finance based on risk grade of the borrower, by opting for IMGC default guarantee cover,” said P K Gupta, MD (Retail & Digital Banking), SBI.
SBI further said the MoU with IMGC will pave the way for the bank to introduce many more products in the mortgage guarantee backed home loan segment to fulfil the needs of Indians of buying their dream homes.
“The exclusive arrangement with SBI is aligned to our joint goal of responsibly expanding the housing finance market in India, through innovative product offerings,” Mahesh Misra, CEO, IMGC.
IMGC is a joint venture between National Housing Bank, Genworth Inc International Finance Corporation and Asian Development Bank. It is providing mortgage default guarantee to the lending Institutions in India.
As on December 31, 2017, SBI had a deposit base of Rs 26.51 lakh crore. It has 32.16 per cent market share in home loans and 35.54 per cent market share in auto loan."

State Bank of India will soon have a blockchain-based exchange for bad debts along with other banks, asset reconstruction companies and investors on the same infrastructure, according to Sudin Baraokar, Head Innovation, SBI.
India’s largest public sector bank, which is also among the top 40 globally, will implement four or five blockchain-ready business solutions.
With Indian banks saddled with an estimated $210 billion of non-performing assets (NPAs), of which over $30 billion are with SBI alone, a blockchain-based exchange will provide a common platform that will enable data-driven price discovery. Similarly, trade finance and loan exchanges are also planned, he said.
Blockchain, a unified IT infrastructure for which SBI is working with over 30 banks, including public sector, cooperative and foreign banks, and global companies in IT, will be the next big step for the bank.
SBI was among the early adopters of IT and has a core banking solution that is benchmarked for over two billion transactions a day, about 23,000 a second, with over 550 million accounts, he said.
Addressing a seminar on emerging trends in financial services organised by business and management consulting firm EY, he said a unified infrastructure with all related participants on board will help avoid debacles like the recent bank guarantee/LoU-related frauds. Everybody will know the origin of a transactions and the entity responsible for its final settlement, he pointed out.
SBI is keen on building innovation in collaboration with international players and start-ups to bring down development time for technology-based financial services, Baraokar said."

SBI is vulnerable for further fall (₹234.6)
The ongoing scams and frauds in the banking sector is keeping stocks in this space under pressure. SBI tumbled about 7 per cent breaking below the crucial support level of ₹241. The fall last week indicates that the downtrend is intact and is gaining strength. Key resistances are at ₹241 and ₹250, which can cap the upside in the short term. A fall to ₹226 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement support level is likely in the short-term. A bounce back-move to ₹241 from ₹226 cannot be ruled out. However, the upside is expected to be capped as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels and cap the upside. An eventual break below ₹226 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or 190 over the medium term. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go short at current levels and at ₹240. Keep the stop-loss at ₹248 for the target of ₹205. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹232 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹227. The downside pressure will ease only if SBI breaches ₹250 decisive. But that looks unlikely in the near term.
Short-term view is negative for ITC (₹256.3)
Weakness in the broader markets dragged ITC below the key support level of ₹258 in the final trading session of the week. The ₹258-₹259 resistance region can cap the upside in the near term. As long as the stock trades below ₹259, a fall to ₹251 or ₹250 is likely. Short-term traders can go short at the current levels and at ₹258. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹259.5 for the target of ₹251. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹255 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹253. A bounce-back thereafter from ₹250 can ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹257 or ₹258 again. But if ITC declines below ₹250 decisively, the downmove can then extend to ₹247 or ₹244 over the medium term. But such a fall will be a good buying opportunity for the medium and long-term investors. Cluster of supports are poised between ₹245 and ₹230, which can halt the downtrend. A strong upward reversal thereafter will mark the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend. Long-term investors can hold the long positions and accumulate at ₹247. Retain the stop-loss at ₹220.
Infosys consolidated within its uptrend (₹1,167.4)
The ₹1,140-₹1,130 region continues to provide strong support for Infosys. The stock made a low of ₹1,140 and has reversed higher from there. The ₹1,130-₹1,200 sideways range remains intact. Intermediate resistance is at ₹1,177. A break above it can take Infosys higher to ₹1,200. Inability to break above ₹1,200 can pull the stock lower and continue to keep it in the ₹1,130-₹1,200 range. A strong break above ₹1,200 is needed for Infosys to gain fresh momentum. Such a break can take it higher to ₹1,210. Further break above ₹1,210 will see the stock rallying to ₹1,250 and even higher thereafter. On the other hand, Infosys will come under pressure if it breaks below ₹1,130. Such a break will see an intermediate dip to ₹1,100. Further fall below ₹1,100 is less probable as fresh buyers may emerge at lower levels. Also, the overall bias is bullish for Infosys to breach ₹1,200 and extend its upmove over a medium and long term. So any intermediate fall below ₹1,130 will be a good buying opportunity. Both medium- and long-term investors can hold the long positions.
Immediate outlook is unclear for RIL (₹892.8)
RIL was stuck in a narrow range in the past week. The stock was range-bound between ₹887 and ₹911 and has closed on a slightly negative note. The immediate outlook is unclear. Traders can stay out of the stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges. As long as the stock remains below ₹900, a fall to test the crucial support at ₹870 is likely. A break below ₹870 can drag RIL to ₹860 and ₹850 thereafter. But if the stock manages to sustain above the support at ₹870 and reverses higher, the downside pressure will ease. Such a reversal will indicate that the broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range is intact. The stock has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time since last November. Intermediate resistance is at ₹900 and cluster of resistances are poised between ₹920 and ₹930. A strong break above ₹930 will pave way for a fresh rally to ₹960. RIL will gain fresh bullish momentum only if it breaks above ₹960 decisively. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹1,000 or even higher thereafter.
Downtrend intact for Tata Steel (₹566.6)
As expected, Tata Steel extended its fall for the third consecutive week. The stock was down 5.6 per cent last week. Tata Steel has tumbled 16 per cent over the last three weeks. Immediate support is at ₹550. But the stock is vulnerable to break below this level in the coming days as the downtrend has gathered momentum and any upmove would find fresh selling interest coming into the stock. Such a break can drag it to ₹540 or ₹530. The region between ₹540-₹530 is a strong medium-term support. Since the stock has been falling continuously over the last few weeks, a relief rally from the ₹540-₹530 support zone cannot be ruled out. An upward reversal from this support zone can take the stock higher to ₹585 or even ₹600. But if Tata Steel breaks below ₹530 decisively, it can tumble to ₹500 or even ₹480 over the medium term. Traders can hold the short positions. Revise the stop-loss lower to the level of ₹585. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹575 as soon as the stock dips to ₹555. Book profits at ₹545."

SBI Card, the country’s second largest credit card issuer, will soon leverage new age technologies like Artificial Intelligence and chatbots to enrich customer experience for its nearly 5.9 million users, a top official said.
“We are going to come out with major interventions on the technology front. We might bring chatbots, AI to see that customers benefit immensely,” Hardayal Prasad, Managing Director & CEO, SBI Card, told BusinessLine here.
In his first interview after assuming charge of SBI Card in February this year, Prasad said SBI Card is not worried about the rapid strides made by digital payment products such as e-wallets and UPI in the Indian market.
Significant growth
“In my view, the era of plastics (physical cards) will remain for some time in India. They (e-wallets, UPI, etc) don’t pose a threat at all to cards. We are growing significantly as a card issuer,” Prasad said.
Last year alone, the total spends on the SBI Card universe grew a whopping 80 per cent.
Prasad said SBI Card looks at developments in the digital space as “only opportunities” and not as a threat to the survival of physical cards. He laid out five focus areas — strategic priorities — for him in the coming days.
 “First, we want to remain a leader in card acquisition; second is we will continue to bring out excellent products to wow customers; third will be to push technology improvements; fourth is focus on profitability and also ensure that we contribute to the growth of the payments ecosystem in India.” Currently, the penetration of credit card in India is low and there is ample scope for growth, he said, adding that SBI Card wants people to experience this as much as possible.
“We are already nimble footed and will continue to use new technologies. If we don’t rely on strong analytics, do not tweak products and change with times, the card industry will not survive,” he said.
It may be recalled that GE had exited SBI Card in December last year.
Besides its leadership position in open market operations, SBI Card is now leveraging its parent SBI’s strength to expand its customer base. “In recent months, as much as 50 per cent of new customer acquisitions for SBI Card is coming from SBI. This was just 35 per cent earlier. We are now definitely leveraging on the SBI network,” Prasad said. SBI Card on Tuesday partnered with the Indian Medical Association to launch ‘Doctor’s SBI Card’ — an exclusive credit card for doctors. 
Doctor’s SBI card
Doctor’s SBI Card offers the industry-first feature of professional indemnity cover of ₹10 lakh to protect doctors against professional risks and liabilities. There will also be accelerated rewards on spend categories relevant for them such as medical supplies, travel and international spends. 
Each Doctor’s SBI Card is personalised with ‘Dr’ embossed on the front of the card against the name of the cardholder together with qualification degrees of the nedical practitioner, making it an exclusive product."

Near-term outlook is unclear for SBI (₹250.1)
Contrary to expectations of a fall, SBI witnessed a sharp bounce in the past week. The near-term outlook is unclear. The price action will be key in deciding the next move. Key resistance is in the ₹257-260 region. If SBI manages to breach ₹260 decisively, the downside pressure will ease. Such a break will trigger a relief rally towards ₹271 — a 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level — initially on the back of short covering. Further break above ₹271 will see the up-move extending towards ₹283 — a trendline as well as the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance level. A rally beyond ₹283 is unlikely as the upside is expected to be capped at this level. SBI will come under pressure again only if it breaks below ₹240 decisively. Such a break will bring the bears back into the stock. It will signal the resumption of the overall downtrend and increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹200 and ₹190 over the medium term. Traders can stay out of the stock and wait for a clear trend and a trade signal to emerge.
ITC can remain range bound (₹255.9)
ITC was volatile in the past week. Though it opened with a wide gap-down, it managed to reverse sharply higher closing the gap and surged to a high of ₹265.75 on the same day. However, ITC failed to sustain and came off from this high again, giving back most of the gains made during the week. It closed on a flat note. A dip to revisit the crucial support at ₹250 is likely in the near term. If the stock manages to bounce again from ₹250, it can move higher and remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. But if ITC declines below ₹250 decisively, a fresh fall to ₹247 or ₹244 is possible. As mentioned last week, a cluster of supports poised between ₹245 and ₹230 can halt the current downtrend. A strong upward reversal thereafter will mark the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend. So, investors holding the long positions can accumulate at ₹247 and retain the stop-loss at ₹220. A strong break above ₹265 will bring fresh bullish momentum and take ITC higher to ₹270 and ₹275 thereafter.
Short-term view is negative for Infosys (₹1,134.4)
Infosys tumbled 2.8 per cent last week. The short-term outlook has turned negative after last week’s strong fall. Immediate resistances are at ₹1,140 and ₹1,145. A break above ₹1,145 can ease the downside pressure and take the stock up to ₹1,160. Further break above ₹1,160 will increase the possibility of the stock revisiting ₹1,200 levels. If Infosys remains below ₹1,145, it can be under pressure. While below ₹1,145, a fall to ₹1,090 or ₹1,085 is likely in the short term. Further fall below ₹1,085 is less probable now. But if Infosys breaks below ₹1,085, it will indicate a double-top formation on the chart. This will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹1,050 or even ₹1,030 over the medium term. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go short at current levels. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,165 for the target of ₹1,085. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹1,120 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹1,110. However, the fall to ₹1,050-₹1,030 will be a good buying opportunity for long-term investors.
RIL hovers above a crucial support (₹882.8)
RIL seems to lack strength to breach the psychological level of ₹900. The stock made a high of ₹910 only to close 1.1 per cent lower for the week. A crucial support is at ₹870, which is likely to be tested. If RIL manages to bounce from there, the downside pressure will ease. It will keep the broader ₹870-960 sideways range intact and increase the possibility of the stock bouncing back to ₹900 and ₹920 initially. Further break above ₹920 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹960 — the upper end of the range in the short term. On the other hand, if RIL breaks below ₹870, it can fall to ₹860 or ₹855. A trend line as well as the 200-day moving average supports are poised between ₹860 and ₹855. A strong break below ₹855 will bring renewed pressure for the stock. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹820 or even ₹800 on the back of profit-booking. This down move below ₹855 could be swift as stop-loss orders are likely to be triggered below this level.
Tata Steel can consolidate sideways (₹570.9)
Tata Steel managed to sustain above the key support level of ₹550 last week. However, the price action on the chart reflects that the stock lacks strong buying interest. It made a high of ₹598.85 and has come off from it. A revisit to ₹550 is likely in the near term. A bounce from ₹550 can take it back to ₹600 again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹550 and ₹600 can be seen for some time. If Tata Steel manages to breach ₹600, the downside pressure can ease and a rally to ₹635 is possible. Further break above ₹635 looks unlikely at the moment as the bias continues to remain bearish. As such, an eventual break below ₹550 can take Tata Steel lower to ₹535. A strong break below ₹535 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or ₹500 over the medium term. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go short. Keep the stop-loss at ₹605 for the target of ₹515. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹555 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹545."

India’s biggest bank intends to showcase its heritage in a new light.
If you are a State Bank of India customer in a historic Indian city, chances are you that you will soon see iconic branches, many of them heritage buildings, decked up in an array of lights.
This is part of the banking behemoth’s attempt to win public attention and build on its brand image. And it coincides with the first anniversary of SBI’s merger with its associate banks.
Merger helps
While SBI itself has several buildings going back to the colonial era, the lender’s merger with its associate banks last year led to the discovery of a wealth of heritage buildings. The associate banks, which were patronised by the princely kingdoms of Hyderabad, Patiala, Bikaner and Jaipur, Mysore, and Travancore were headquartered in impressive historic structures.
So, in 25 cities across the country, SBI’s landmark offices will be spruced up and lit,
“As part of this initiative, we have completed illumination of about 10 branches across locations. Work is on on the remaining branches,” J Swaminathan, Chief General Manager, SBI, Hyderabad Circle told BusinessLine.
The offices being showcased include the SBI building in Gunfoundry, Hyderabad, the main branches at Kochi, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bharuch, Rajkot, Lucknow and Mumbai. The offices at Chennai IFB, Chandini Chowk, New Delhi, Gwalior, Behrampur, Amritsar, Kolkata, Varanasi and Allahabad, among others, are also on the list.
Reconnecting
The bank sees the illumination project as a way to strike a bond with local residents who have been loyal customers.
“We are attached to State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) main branch in Gunfoundry in the historic building. With the illumination, the change of name from SBH to SBI is quite discernible. The merger also enriched the heritage assets of SBI in different locations such as Hyderabad,” says an old-time customer.
Rich history
SBI, whose origins trace back to the establishment of the Bank of Calcutta in 1806, has inherited large heritage properties in its long and rich history.
In 1809, the Bank of Calcutta received its charter and was re-designated the Bank of Bengal. It was the first joint-stock bank of British India, and was sponsored by the government of Bengal. The Bank of Bombay (1840) and the Bank of Madras (1843) soon followed.
These three banks remained at the apex of modern banking in India till their amalgamation as the Imperial Bank of India in 1921 before becoming State Bank of India in 1955."

SBI forms a bullish reversal pattern (₹259.8)
After an initial struggle, SBI managed to breach decisively the 21-day moving average (₹250) resistance towards the end of the week. The stock was up 3.8 per cent last week and has closed on a strong note. The level of ₹250 will now be a good support for the stock. The price action on the chart since March indicates the formation of an inverted head and shoulder pattern. This is a bullish reversal pattern. The neckline resistance of this pattern is at ₹262. A strong break above ₹262 will confirm this pattern and take SBI higher to ₹268 initially. Further break above ₹268 will pave way for the next targets of ₹275 and ₹280. On the other hand, if SBI fails to rise past ₹262 in the coming days, it can fall back towards ₹250 levels again. A break below ₹250 can then drag the stock lower to ₹240 levels again. Traders can go long on a break above ₹262. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹252 for the target of ₹280. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹265 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹268.
Near-term view is positive for ITC (₹260.6)
ITC remained broadly in a sideways range all through last week. The near-term view is positive. A rise to test the ₹264-₹266 resistance region is possible in the coming days. Whether ITC breaks above ₹266 or not will be key in deciding the next move. A strong break above ₹266 will bring renewed strength to the stock. Such a break can then trigger a fresh rally to ₹274. The rally to ₹274 will also mark the end of the downtrend that has been in place since February. On the other hand, if ITC fails to breach ₹266 and reverses lower in the coming days, it can fall to ₹260 or ₹257 again. The region between ₹257 and ₹255 is a key near-term support. A bounce from this support zone can take the stock ITC higher again and keep it range-bound between ₹255 and ₹266 for some time. But if ITC declines below ₹255, it can fall to test the crucial support level of ₹250. A break below it can drag it to ₹250. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at the level of ₹220.
Short-term outlook is negative for Infosys (₹1,129.3)
Infosys remained subdued and range-bound between ₹1,120 and ₹1,150. Key resistances are at ₹1,147 and ₹1,155. As long as the stock remains below these resistances, a fall to ₹1,090 cannot be ruled out. A bounce from ₹1,090 will ease the pressure and take Infosys higher to ₹1,150 levels again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range bound between ₹1,090 and ₹1,200 for sometime. But if Infosys breaks below ₹1,090, a fall to ₹1,050 or even ₹1,030 is possible over the medium-term. But further fall below the ₹1,050-₹1,030 support zone is unlikely as fresh buyers can emerge in the market. As mentioned last week, a fall to ₹1,050-₹1,030, if seen, will be a good buying opportunity for long-term investors. Traders who have taken short positions last week can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,165 for a revised target of ₹1,105. Move the stop-loss lower to ₹1,125 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹1,115. Medium and long-term investors can hold the long positions.
Near-term view is positive for RIL (₹909.7)
RIL snapped its four-week fall. The stock surged 2.8 per cent last week. Key resistances are at ₹921 and ₹928, which are likely to be tested in the near term. Inability to breach these hurdles can pull the stock lower to ₹900 or ₹890 levels again. But if RIL manages to breach ₹928 decisively, it can gain momentum. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹960 over the short term. A strong break above ₹928 will boost the momentum. Such a break can take RIL higher to ₹960 in the short term. The level of ₹960 is a crucial resistance for RIL. A strong break above it will pave way for the next targets of ₹1,000 and ₹1,020 over the medium. But if RIL reverses lower from ₹960, it can fall back to ₹920 or ₹900 levels again. In such a scenario, the broader ₹870-₹960 range will remain intact. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can go long at current levels. Keep the stop-loss at ₹885 for the target of ₹955. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹920 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹935.
Resistance to cap the upside in Tata Steel (₹586.3)
Tata Steel remained lower but in a narrow range in the past week. The stock has been consolidating over the last couple of weeks within its overall downtrend. The level of ₹600 is a key near-term resistance. A strong break above it is needed for the downside pressure to ease. Such a break can trigger a corrective rally towards ₹630. But the upside is expected to be capped as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels. As such, a further rally beyond ₹630 looks less probable now as the bias continues to remain bearish on the stock. A revisit of ₹550 is likely in the coming days. A break below ₹550 can take the stock lower to ₹535 initially. Further break below ₹535 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or even ₹500 over the medium term. Traders who have taken short positions can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹605 for the target of ₹515. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹555 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹545.

The State Bank of India (SBI) has set up 60 digital branches across the country with an aim to offer advanced banking services like instant loan approvals, assistance in choosing investment portfolios and access to latest mutual funds among others.
SBI has set up these branches, called sbiINTOUCH, in partnership with Dimension Data, a global technology integrator and managed services provider. The digital branches aims to help SBI expand its reach with increasing profitability.
Equipped with the latest technology, these branches provide the customers an audio-visual experience with the added ability to print, scan and share the document using touchscreen controls. It also helps create an instant connection with the customer in real-time, thereby ensuring that SBI doesn’t lose a potential customer.
“As India’s largest bank with over 16 crore transactions per day, 25,000 branches and over 730 million customers, SBI has unique challenges to stay relevant and provide the right solutions to our diverse clientele. We have constantly innovated using transformative technology to bring our customers closer to the Bank,” said Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, Deputy Managing Director and CIO, SBI.
He further added that the solution will help make banking a lot more personalised for SBI customers with a superior virtual non-transactional banking experience.
On need of having digital branches, Kiran Bhagwanani, CEO – South Asia, Japan and New Zealand of Dimension Data said that the banks need to constantly strive to innovate and differentiate themselves to maintain customer loyalty. “The solution will enable SBI to transform its communication model for better customer loyalty which will further help SBI improve sales, cross-sales and in upselling. As for the SBI customer, this will ensure that he/she gets the right advice for all non-transactional processes,” he added.
According to an analyst firm, 70 per cent of customers and prospects will choose a competition service provider if an expert is not present at the delivery channel when and where he makes an initial inquiry regarding a product or service, the statement said adding that this is the segment of customers which SBI wants to attract."

Resistance caps the upside in SBI (₹251.2)
SBI failed to breach the key resistance level of ₹262 last week. The stock reversed sharply lower after making a high of ₹265.25 and closed 3.3 per cent down for the week. Immediate support is at ₹248. If SBI manages to sustain above this support, a bounce-back move to ₹262 is possible again. 
 








 
 
A strong break above ₹262 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹270 initially. Further break above ₹270 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹283 or ₹285. On the other hand, if SBI declines below the immediate support at ₹248 in the coming days, it can come under more pressure. Such a break can drag it to the crucial support level of ₹240. Whether SBI breaks below ₹240 or not will decide the next move. A bounce from ₹240 can keep it range-bound between ₹240 and ₹260 for some time. But a strong break and a decisive close below ₹240 can bring renewed pressure on the stock. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or ₹190 over the medium term.
ITC may remain range-bound (₹260.8)
ITC rallied as expected to test the resistance at ₹266. But it failed to sustain higher and came-off sharply from ₹268.2 and closed the week on a flat note. Inability to bounce from the current levels can keep the stock under pressure. Support is at ₹258. A break below it can drag the stock lower to ₹255 or even ₹250 in the short term. The region between ₹251 and ₹250 is a crucial support that has been limiting the downside since November. An upward reversal from this support region can take ITC higher to ₹260 and ₹265 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below ₹250 decisively. Such a break can take the stock lower to ₹245 or ₹244 initially. Further break below ₹244 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹235 or even lower. On the other hand, if ITC bounces from the immediate support at ₹258, it can move up to ₹265 or ₹267. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220
Infosys maintains its uptrend (₹1,169)
Infosys snapped its three-week fall as the psychological support at ₹1,100 held well. The stock made a low of ₹1,105 and surged to close the week 3.3 per cent higher. This upward reversal keeps the ₹1,100-₹1,200 sideways range intact. Infosys has been stuck in this range since February. As long as the stock remains above the ₹1,150-₹1,140 support zone, the possibility is high of it extending its upmove towards ₹1,200. Inability to break above ₹1,200 can drag Infosys lower to ₹1,150 or even lower. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound for some time. But if Infosys manages to breach ₹1,200 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹1,250 or ₹1,270. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 or even higher levels over the long term. The stock will come under pressure only if it breaks below the ₹1,100-₹1,090 support
Key resistance ahead for RIL (₹938.85)
RIL extended its rally for the second consecutive week. The stock surged 3.2 per cent in the past week. The near-term view remains positive. Support is in the ₹925-₹920 region. The stock can extend its current upmove and test the crucial resistance level of ₹960 in the coming days. Inability to break above ₹960 and a subsequent pull-back move will take the stock lower to ₹920. In such a scenario, the broader ₹870-₹960 sideways range will remain intact. RIL has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time. On the other hand, the stock will gain fresh momentum if it manages to breach ₹960 decisively. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying towards ₹1,000 and ₹1,020 in the coming weeks. The outlook will turn negative only if the stock breaks below ₹870. But such a break look less probable at the moment. Traders who have taken long positions last week can hold it with a revised stop-loss at ₹920 and target of ₹955. Move the stop-loss further higher to ₹938 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹945.
Tata Steel lacks strength (₹593.3)
Tata Steel inched higher for the third consecutive week. The stock was up 1.5 per cent. Immediate support is at ₹588 — the 21-day moving average that is likely to be tested in the initial part of the week. An upward reversal from there will see the current rally extending towards ₹620 or even ₹630 in the coming weeks. Further break above ₹630 looks less likely now as fresh sellers may emerge at higher levels. A pull-back fromthe level of ₹630 can drag the stock to ₹600 or even lower levels thereafter. On the other hand, if Tata Steel declines below the 21-day moving average (₹588) support, it can fall to ₹570 or ₹560. Further break below ₹560 will then increase the likelihood of the stock falling towards ₹550 or ₹545. The region between ₹550 and ₹545 is a key medium-term support. A break below ₹545 can take the stock lower to ₹535 initially. Further break below ₹535 will then increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹510 or ₹500 over the medium term."
305,2018-04-19,State Bank,"SBI chief: Cash shortage problem should get resolved by Friday
 The problem of cash crunch being faced by some States will be resolved by tomorrow [Friday] as currency is being transported to areas which are facing the shortage, SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said today. Kumar said there are certain areas where there is a problem with running of ATMs and availability of cash of particular denomination.
“It is not a uniform cash crunch problem. It is there in geographies like Telangana and Bihar. We are hoping that the problem will be resolved by tomorrow because cash is in transition and it is reaching these states by today evening,” Kumar told reporters here.
The Finance Ministry said earlier this week that there is an unusual spurt in demand in some parts of the country like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, MP and Bihar. In the first 13 days of the current month, the currency demand went up by ₹45,000 crore.
Holding accountable those who are hoarding cash, Kumar said the money should be recycled, meaning that if people withdraw money from the bank, the money needs to be deposited back as well.
“If we (people) hold everything, then whatever supply we (banks) do, it will be insufficient for the country. So it is important that the currency is also recycled,” he said. Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg had earlier this week said that the government suspects that ₹2,000 notes are being hoarded as they are not coming back into the circulation fast enough. To deal with currency shortage, the printing of ₹500 notes have been increased 5 times."

We in the textile industry do not need any support in the form of incentives but need policy support. Here is what India as a country needs for a competitive textile industry
- Removal of hank yarn obligation for the spinning industry.
- Inverted GST structure from fiber to fabric in the MMF sector, at 18% for fiber, 12% for yarn and 5% for fabric and no refund at fabric stage the tax burden is pushing up costs at fabric stage and is making Indian fabric non competitive.
- GST on power, transport and real estate. These sectors are out of GST regime. If brought into the GST regime will help push up each of the sectors viz spinning, weaving and garmenting by 1% each
- Scrap anti-dumping duty on monopoly products like polyester filament, viscose filament and fiber and acrylics and spandex.
- FTA with SAFTA , now duty free imports are available from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and host of LDC countries who can easily use Chinese of Indonesian fabric. If rules of origin are set that Indian yarn and fabric needs to be used Indian exports from textiles will go up.

Risky SBI?
Is keeping fixed deposits in State Bank of India, the country’s largest commercial bank, becoming a risky proposition? As a retired person, I think so. I have put my life’s savings in a Kolkata branch but now find, much to my horror, that the principal amount of the FD is getting depleted thanks to the much-vaunted SBI brand of efficiency. The bank has deducted nearly ₹20,000 from the principal amount on the grounds that it did not deduct enough tax in the past on the interest income on the FD. How can the bank touch my FD without informing me, more so when I have enough funds in my Savings Bank account in the same branch? Alternatively, the bank could have refrained from paying me the full interest amount due on my FD. Tax can be collected only on interest income and certainly not on principal amount of FD. If the bank had failed to deduct tax on time in the past, it is not my fault, and it is a lapse on the bank’s part. Why should I suffer for something for which I am not responsible for? I fear that in this way my whole savings might disappear one day. I have approached different levels in the bank but all I get is the stock reply: it is a system generated failure. The system remains idle when thousands of crores of rupees of bank money are siphoned off by big business and industrialists but becomes hyperactive when it comes to fleecing small depositors on one pretext or the other. An FD is a contract and what the SBI has done is a breach of contract.

HAL writes
This is in reference to ‘IAF hits runway again for a new fighter’ (April 24). We feel that the statement “HAL, which already has infrastructure and experience for aircraft assembly, has so far not proved to be a worthy recipient of technology, while private players will take some time to establish the infrastructure (but eventually contribute hugely to India’s stature as an aerospace power)”, is unfair to HAL.
HAL, as the premier aeronautical complex in Asia, has built over 4,000 aircraft so far of which 14 types were under license from various OEMs and design agencies from UK, France and Russia. The licensors included reputed companies such as BAE Systems, Eurocopter, Sukhoi Aircraft Design Bureau etc.
There are many companies of world repute which are in discussions with HAL for their programs. Also, under the latest technology transfer projects, HAL has built over 180 Su 30 MkI aircraft and 100 Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer in short timeframes.
Notwithstanding the criticism by the retired IAF officer, HAL has assimilated all high end technologies for every project it has undertaken and has built a very strong supply chain eco-system in India for aviation and aerospace sector. It is worth mentioning that most of the private industries in India in the Defence sector today have emerged through association with HAL.

State Bank of India has strengthened its top-level management by promoting nine Chief General Managers to the level of Deputy Managing Directors.
The Chief General Managers (CGMs) who have become Deputy Managing Directors (DMDs) are: Anil Kishora, Ramesh Babu Boddu, PN Prasad, Sujit Kumar Varma, Sanjeev Nautiyal, DA Tambe, Hardayal Prasad, Partha Pratim Sengupta, and Challa Srinivasulu Setty.
Following the elevation of the above-mentioned senior officers and expected superannuation of a few CGMs, India’s largest bank has called about 60 General Managers for interview early next month to fill about 20 CGM vacancies.
Excluding the newly-promoted DMDs, SBI has 14 DMDs at the corporate centre. SBI Capital Markets and SBI Life Insurance are also headed by SBI officers of DMD rank.
After the elevation of Rajnish Kumar as Chairman of SBI in October 2017, one Managing Director’s position has fallen vacant. The bank currently has three MDs – B Sriram, Parveen Kumar Gupta and Dinesh Kumar Khara. A fourth MD is expected to be appointed soon.

Historic relations The SBI headquarters in Kolkata. The bank’s roots in the city date back to the 19th century
   -  Debasish Bhaduri


In a break from years of tradition, the State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to relocate its annual board meeting from Kolkata. This year, it will take place in Mumbai, its corporate headquarters.
SBI’s roots in Kolkata date back to the 19th century, when the Bank of Bengal was established. In 1921, the Bank of Bengal and two other Presidency banks — Bank of Bombay and Bank of Madras — were “reorganised” into Imperial Bank, which was reconstituted as the ‘State Bank of India’ in 1955.
The relationship between SBI and Kolkata took a hit in the 1970s, when the corporate headquarters was shifted to Mumbai, then Bombay. However, till the 1990s, some departmental headquarters were still based out of Kolkata. For the last quarter of a century, the annual board meet remained its sole link to the city, but even that now stands snapped.
The move comes at a time when the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government has been projecting the State as “Best Bengal” or “Sonar Bangla”.
Banking industry sources link the development with the perceived decline in the State’s economic importance. “There is no legal binding on SBI to hold the board meet in Kolkata. But erstwhile chairpersons had been upholding this tradition. Business was never the consideration,” an ex-SBI official said, requesting anonymity.
SBI did not respond to mails sent by BusinessLine. Nor did it confirm whether this year’s meeting location is a one-off or will henceforth be the norm.
According to senior SBI officials, the top management has cited “logistics issues”.
Apart from the Chairman and three MDs, 14 Deputy MDs, nearly 44 CGMs, other senior board members and support staff come down for the meeting annually. An entourage of 200-odd people, which includes several analysts, flies down.
The IPL theory
Accommodating such a huge number of people during the ongoing IPL season is difficult.
However, Kolkata hoteliers discount the IPL theory. According to them, there are only two or three hotels where IPL teams are put up. These aren’t the ones where SBI puts up its officials and guests.
“Even if SBI considers the cost of travel and putting up its officials and guests in hotels, it is not going to exceed ₹10 crore. It’s not huge by SBI’s scale,” said the top official of another bank.“However, the board meet relocation could impact the bank’s historical connection with the city.”"

SBI (₹250.9)
SBI rose 3.7 per cent last week. This rally has eased the downside pressure and turned the near-term view positive. So, traders can exit and book loss on the short positions taken a couple of weeks back. An immediate resistance is in the ₹253-₹254 region, which is likely to be tested in the early part of the week. A break above ₹254 can take the stock higher to ₹259 and ₹260. Further break above ₹260 can extend the up-move to ₹264 and ₹265. The level of ₹265 is a crucial short-term resistance. Inability to breach this hurdle can pull the stock lower to ₹255 and ₹250. In such a scenario, SBI can remain range-bound between ₹230 and ₹265 for some time. If SBI breaks above ₹265 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹270 or even ₹280 levels in the coming weeks. It will also signal that the downtrend that has been in place since November last year has come to an end.










 ITC (₹283.9) 
 ITC reversed higher last week and was up 2.3 per cent. The 55-week moving average at ₹277 has been providing strong support for the stock over the last two weeks, keeping the overall bullish outlook intact. However, a crucial resistance cluster is ahead in the ₹285-₹290 region. ITC has to breach above ₹290 decisively to keep the current uptrend intact. Price action on the charts suggests that the possibility is high of the stock breaching ₹290 and targeting ₹295 initially. Further break above ₹295 will take the stock up to ₹305. On the other hand, if ITC reverses lower from ₹290 , it can fall to ₹280 or ₹275 — a key short-term support. An immediate break below ₹275 looks less probable at the moment. If the stock manages to sustain above ₹275, a range-bound move between ₹275 and ₹290 can be seen in the short term. If ITC breaks below ₹275, a fall to ₹270 or ₹268 is possible. Long-term investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220.










 Infosys (₹1,181) 
 Infosys remained subdued and closed on a mixed note last week. The 21-day moving average at ₹1,167 had provided strong support for the stock. As long as Infosys remains above this support, It can break above the crucial ₹1,200-₹1,205 resistance region. Such a break will mark the end of the prolonged sideways consolidation phase. The stock has been stuck in the band between ₹1,100 and ₹1,200 since January. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,205 will take the stock higher to revisit the previous highs of ₹1,278. Such a rally will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 and ₹1,375 levels over the medium term. The near-term view will turn negative if the stock declines below the 21-day moving average. In such a scenario, a fall to ₹1,140 or ₹1,135 levels is possible. Further break below ₹1,135 will see the down-move extending to ₹1,100 . Both medium- and long-term investors can hold their long positions.










RIL (₹988.5)
RIL managed to reverse higher in the past week and has recovered most of the loss made in the week earlier. The stock surged 3.6 per cent last week. Though the weekly chart gives a mixed picture, the daily candles leave the near-term outlook positive. A test of the psychological resistance level of ₹1,000 is possible. A strong break above ₹1,000 will take the stock higher to ₹1,030 . Whether RIL breaks above ₹1,030 or not will decide the next move. Inability to break above ₹1,030 can pull the stock lower to ₹1,000. A break below ₹1,000, will see the down-move extending towards ₹980 or ₹970. On the other hand, if RIL manages to break above ₹1,030 decisively, it can gain fresh momentum and rally towards ₹1,085. The 21-day moving average at ₹959 is a key support. The outlook will turn negative only if RIL declines below this support. A strong break below ₹959 will then increase the possibility of the stock falling to ₹930 or even ₹900 .










 Tata Steel (₹606)
Tata Steel has risen, breaking above the key psychological resistance level of ₹600 last week. This has eased the downside pressure and is also slightly turning the bias positive. The key resistance is in the ₹615-620 region is likely to be tested in the coming days. Traders who have taken short position last week on rallies at ₹590 and ₹596 can exit and book loss at current level. Whether Tata Steel breaks above ₹620 or not will be key in deciding the next move. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹620 ease the downside pressure. Such a break will take the stock higher to ₹635 or even to ₹650. This move above ₹620 could be swift on the back of short covering. On the other hand, if Tata Steel reverses lower from ₹620, it can fall to ₹600 initially. If it manages to bounce from this psychological support, a range-bound move between ₹600 and ₹620 can be seen for some time. But a break below ₹600 can drag the stock lower to ₹585."

 Delayed payments under the guaranteed rural employment programme MNREGA fell to a six-year low of Rs 67,956 crore in the last fiscal ended March 31, an SBI research report said today.
The amount of delayed payments had touched a high of Rs 2.38 lakh crore in 2015-16. It was Rs 2.08 lakh crore in 2016-17, said the SBI Ecowrap report based on government data. On the other hand, total payments under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) was also at a six-year high of Rs 3.87 lakh crore.
“Delayed payments, which were as high as Rs 2.38 lakh crore in FY16, had declined significantly to a mere Rs 67,956 crore in FY18. As a percentage of total payments, the share of delayed payments has decelerated continuously and sharply from 73 per cent in FY15 to 18 per cent in FY18,” the report said.
Furthermore, it said the share of more than 90 days in delayed payment has also improved materially and declined from 30 per cent in 2012-13 to 8 per cent last fiscal. The report also pointed out that although there were only 18 per cent of delayed payments at the all-India level, the situation of some of the states is “worrisome”.
Apart from the eight north-eastern states, the big states that have delayed payments more than the national average were Bihar (39 per cent payments were delayed), Uttar Pradesh (36 per cent), Punjab (30 per cent), Maharashtra (27 per cent) and Karnataka (23 per cent)."

 SBI (₹239.2)
SBI began the week on a positive note, but it was short-lived. The stock touched a high of ₹257.2 and came off sharply from there to close 4.7 per cent lower for the week. The near-term view is bearish. A fall to test the crucial support level of ₹231 is likely. If SBI manages to bounce from ₹231, the downside pressure would ease. A relief rally to ₹250 or ₹255 is possible then. Also, a range-bound move between ₹231 and ₹255 is possible for some time in such a scenario. But if SBI breaks below ₹231 decisively, it can come under renewed pressure. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹200 or ₹195 over the medium term. The region around ₹195 is a strong long-term support which can halt the downtrend that has been in place since November last year. Traders with a medium-term perspective can go short at current levels and on rallies at ₹245. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹265 for the target of ₹200. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹240 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹225.










 ITC (₹282.1)
ITC was volatile last week. The stock has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹276 and ₹290 over the last three weeks. Last week’s candle on the weekly chart reflects indecisiveness in the market. This leaves the short-term outlook unclear for the stock. A breakout on either side of ₹276 or ₹290 will decide the next move. If ITC declines below ₹276, it can fall to test the ₹269-₹267 support region. A bounce from this support zone will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹280 and ₹285 again. But a strong break below ₹267can drag the stock lower to ₹260 or even ₹255. On the other hand, if ITC manages to sustain above ₹276 in the coming days and breaches ₹290, it can move higher to ₹296 initially. Inability to break above ₹296 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹289. But a strong break above ₹296 will see the stock rallying to ₹303 or ₹305. Such a rally will also mark the end of the downtrend that has been in place since last July. Long-term investors can hold the long positions.










 Infosys (₹1,183.7)
Infosys has been testing the psychological level of ₹1,200 over the last four consecutive weeks. However, the stock seems to be lacking fresh buyers to take it decisively above ₹1,200. It has been facing strong resistance around ₹1,210. A strong break above this hurdle is needed for Infosys to gain fresh momentum. Such a break will see Infosys testing the previous highs of ₹1,278 levels. It will also increase the possibility of the stock targeting ₹1,350 and ₹1,375 levels over the medium term. On the other hand, if Infosys continues to remain below ₹1,200, a fall to ₹1,160 is possible in the near term. It will keep the broader ₹1,100-₹1,200 sideways range intact. The stock has been stuck in this range since January. Further break below ₹1,160 can drag the stock to ₹1,140 or ₹1,135. A bounce from ₹1,135 can trigger a relief rally to ₹1,160 or ₹1,170. But a strong break below ₹1,135 will see Infosys falling towards ₹1,100. Further fall below ₹1,100 is unlikely. Both medium- and long-term investors can hold the long positions.










 RIL (₹933.4)
RIL tumbled over 5 per cent last week. The stock hovers above an immediate support level of ₹929 — the 21-week moving average. This support has been limiting the downside over the last four weeks. If RIL manages to sustain above this support and reverse higher, it can move up to test ₹1,000 levels again. Inability to break above ₹1,000 can continue to keep the stock range-bound between ₹929 and ₹1,000 for some more time. But a strong break above ₹1,000 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹1,030 or ₹1,035. The region between ₹1,030 and ₹1,035 is a crucial medium-term resistance for the stock. Whether RIL breaks above ₹1,035 or not will be key in deciding the next move. On the other hand, if RIL breaks below the immediate support level of ₹929, it can fall to ₹900 or ₹890 in the coming days. A crucial medium-term trend deciding support is poised around ₹890. A decisive weekly close below ₹890 may trigger a sharp corrective fall to ₹850. So the price action around ₹890 will need a close watch.










 Tata Steel (₹591.5)
Tata Steel surged, breaking above the key ₹615-₹620 resistance region last week, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made an intra-week high of ₹636.3 and reversed sharply lower, giving back all the gains made and closed 2.5 per cent lower for the week. Technically, the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance at ₹631 has halted the up-move and triggered the reversal. This indicates that the downtrend that has been in place since January is intact. Immediate resistance is inbetween ₹600 and ₹605. Inability to bounce from the current levels and breach this hurdle can continue to keep the stock under pressure. A fall to ₹570-₹565 is likely. If Tata Steel manages to bounce from ₹565 to ₹570, a relief rally to ₹600 is possible. But a break below ₹565 can drag the stock to ₹550. Traders with high risk appetite can go short on rallies at ₹598 and ₹605. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹615 for the target of ₹570. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹590 when it moves down to ₹580."
296,2018-05-22,State Bank,"SBI to rope in strategic partner for capital market arm
 
State Bank of India will unlock value in its subsidiaries such as SBI Capital Markets and SBI General Insurance in FY2019. India’s largest bank is also revamping its overseas operations to ensure their long-term viability.
“All our subsidiaries have performed exceedingly well. There is a huge value in subsidiaries. We are in active mode in unlocking the value this year and in the next,” said SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar.
Kumar said this year his bank doesn’t need any risk capital as it has internal accruals and surplus. “We need to fund growth. For that, we said that we need about ₹20,000 crore, which will come from the sale of non-core assets, Additional Tier-I bonds, etc,” he explained.
SBI is looking at SBI Capital Markets, which offers investment banking, project finance, initial public offering, merchant banking, mergers and acquisitions and debt restructuring, as a pure investment bank. Hence, the process of hiving off the latter’s project finance function and merging it with the parent is on.
“The intention is to eliminate the duplication of bandwidth between what SBI Caps and SBI do. This will result in faster turnaround time. SBI Caps’ domain knowledge is of immense use to the bank. We are looking at SBI Capital Markets as a pure investment bank. There again, the opportunities are huge,” said Kumar.
The bank is looking to induct a strategic partner in SBI Capital Markets. The partner can have up to 49 per cent stake.
Dinesh Khara, Managing Director, said SBI General Insurance and SBI Cards will be tapping the market this year and next year, respectively.
Overseas operations
B Sriram, Managing Director, said the bank is trying to re-look at some of the unviable overseas offices/ branches and see whether they need to be continued. For example, the Paris office is being closed and will be converted into a representative office, he added.
“In some areas, we are also looking at increasing our presence, especially in the neighbourhood. For example, in Nepal our operations are doing extremely well and there is a lot of advantage in spreading our wings there. And that is something we are looking at,” said Sriram, and added that the intent is to ensure that the long-term viability of SBI’s overseas branches/ offices is maintained. 
Referring to the recently-opened UK subsidiary into which the retail part of the UK operations has been subsumed, Sriram said: “We have 12 branches (in the UK). Going forward, we have to look at how to improve the presence of that subsidiary as well. It is one of our biggest subsidiaries, having a good size of balance sheet ($2 billion).”"

 Shares of State Bank of India rose more than 6 per cent to a 12-week high on Wednesday after the country's largest lender projected a recovery over the next two years following a record quarterly loss.
The lender’s shares rose as much as 6.2 per cent to Rs 269.7, their highest since March 1, and were headed for a third straight session of gains. The surge was also SBI's biggest intraday percentage gain since early November. The Nifty PSU bank index climbed as much as 5 per cent. 
Top brokerages have welcomed SBI's move to clean up its accounts, recognising large part of its stressed assets that forced the Mumbai-based lender to report a quarterly loss of Rs 7,718 crore ($1.13 billion), the second highest in the country's banking industry.
The market may take solace that the gross stress has likely peaked, Jefferies said in a note, adding that core profitability should see a cyclical improvement through the second half of 2019.
SBI added Rs 33,670 crore of non-performing loans in the March quarter, taking its total to Rs 2.23 lakh crore, or 10.91 per cent of total loans. Deutsche Bank said it sees better future for SBI and expects core business trends to improve consistently from here on.
SBI is still among the preferred public sector picks because of stronger CASA franchise, better asset quality and capitalisation, CLSA said in a note.
The lender, which accounts for more than a fifth of India's banking assets, had said on Tuesday it aims to grow loans at an annual average of 12 per cent through March 2020, nearly halve its gross non-performing loan ratio, bring down the provisioning costs and improve margins.
Credit Suisse and Citi have cut their target price to Rs 322 and Rs 325, respectively, while Deutsche Bank has raised it to Rs 330 from Rs 320. Jefferies has cut its target price to Rs 355 from Rs 365, while CASA reduced it to Rs 340 from Rs 360.

 Shares of Bank of Baroda fell as much as 4.1 per cent to Rs 131.35, in their sharpest intraday fall since May 16, as the government is considering the merger of at least four state-run banks.
According to a media report, the government is considering the merger of at least four state-run banks - Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank Ltd, Oriental Bank of Commerce Ltd and Central Bank of India Ltd.
“Big banks like Bank of Baroda, SBI already have a lot of stress and when these small banks like IDBI Bank are merged with the big ones, that would put a lot of pressure on them and it's a big negative for the stock,” says Yuvraj Choudhary, an analyst at Mumbai-based brokerage Anand Rathi.
Shares of IDBI Bank, which has the worst bad-loan ratio among all Indian lenders, were down 0.5 per cent, while Oriental Bank of Commerce and Central Bank of India were up over 0.5 per cent each. Bank of Baroda has fallen nearly 15 per cent this year as of Friday.

 State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender expects to recover around ₹30,000 crore from the resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) during the current fiscal, an official said today.
 From the two stressed assets’ list referred for resolution under IBC by the Reserve Bank of India, the bank’s total exposure was around ₹78,000 crore, Pallav Mohapatra, DMD (stressed assets resolution group) of SBI said.
 The bank had been able to recover ₹8,500 crore from the Bhushan Steel-Tata Steel deal taking a haircut of 30 per cent. From the Electrosteel-Vedanta deal, the bank expects to recover ₹6,000 crore, he told reporters on the sidelines of a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) event here today. The bank’s total NPA stood at ₹2.20 lakh crore.
 Besides recoveries from resolution under IBC, the bank expects to get back another ₹10,000 crore from one-time settlement, sale to ARCs and some from outside NCLT, he said. The bank had filed 250 cases under IBC with a total exposure of ₹ 95,000 crore.
 Mohapatra said “whatever stress is there has been recognised. We don’t expect recovery of the full amount”. He said there will be no dent on profitability of the bank as adequate provisioning had been made for haircuts which is unavoidable."

“In the case of Bhushan Steel, we have got ₹8,500 crore with a 30 per cent haircut; our claim was around ₹11,500 crore. For the other case, the money has been deposited in an escrow account. Once the court gives the clearance, it will be adjusted,"" he said.

289,2018-06-11,State Bank,"SBI Global Factors set to provide credit protection, collection service to SBI
 
 
SBI Global Factors is planning to offer credit protection and collection services to parent State Bank of India (SBI) to mitigate the risk of defaults in the foreign currency credit facilities extended by the latter to its exporter clients.
This move could open up a new revenue stream for SBI’s non-banking finance company (NBFC) subsidiary.
The NBFC, which is the business of providing factoring (discounting invoices of clients to reduce the wait time of their billing cycle) services for domestic and international trade, is banking on its membership of Factors Chain International (FCI) to provide credit protection to foreign currency credit provided by SBI.
FCI is an umbrella organisation of independent factoring companies around the world. It is a global association for open account receivables finance, including factoring and other supply-chain finance solutions.
Collection services
When it comes to collection services, SBI Global Factors has an in-house mechanism for tracking receivables on an invoice-to-invoice basis.
While SBI will continue to provide foreign currency funding to exporters, SBI Global Factors will provide the bank credit protection through the FCI network, and also do the receivables collection, said Tushar Buch, MD & CEO, SBI Global Factors.
“Let us say, an exporter of engineering goods from Ludhiana has a tie-up with SBI for pre-shipment and post-shipment foreign currency credit.
“The bank could take the FCI network cover (for credit protection). We will do the collection. We will charge a small fees for this. So, our machinery is there for the bank for an invoice-to-invoice follow-up (of receivables),” explained Buch
The invoice-to-invoice follow-up by SBI Global Factors could help the bank have better control over the loan facility extended to the exporter.
Buch observed that one of the reasons for bad loans in the banking system is non-moving book debts.
“They (banks) don’t have the wherewithal to closely monitor whether book debts are moving up or down, whereas we do invoice-to-invoice financing. So, if there is a delay in payment of even one invoice, we get the early warning signal,” he said.
SBI Global Factors clocked a turnover of ₹3,555 crore for FY2018, compared to ₹3,047 crore in FY2017. Export factoring turnover touched ₹452 crore for 12 months ended FY2018 against ₹321 crore in previous year, an increase of 41 per cent."

In order to achieve a healthy credit growth of 10-12 per cent by 2020, State Bank of India will adopt a two-pronged strategy comprising portfolio reordering that will reduce the credit risk-weighted assets (CRWA) to total advances ratio.
It also plans to take up internal reorganisation of corporate banking, according to its Chairman, Rajnish Kumar. Through portfolio re-ordering, CRWA to total advances ratio declined by 780 basis points to 71.14 per cent as on March 31, 2018.
A bank achieves reduction in CRWA by funding those assets that have less risk, thereby requiring less capital to make the loan and / or by shedding assets that carry higher risk.
The gross advances of India’s largest bank grew at 4.91 per cent to ₹20,48,387 crore by March 2018 from the previous year’s level of ₹19,52,507 crore.
“Retail segments (personal, SME & agriculture) now constitute 57.5 per cent of the domestic loan book. Much of the growth in advances came from personal retail segments, including home loans and auto loans.
“Overall, personal retail loans grew by 13.55 per cent in FY2018, which is in line with the bank’s strategy of growing more aggressively in this segment,” said Kumar in a communication to shareholders.
Corporate credit
Revamping of the corporate credit structure and system within the bank will proceed on such lines that it will widen the universe of clients and focus on new segments.
“The Corporate Accounts Group (CAG) will focus on high priority and quality individual and group relationships, and the concept of group relationship coordinators will be introduced.
“CAG will offer an end-to-end solution to high-quality large corporates focusing on fee income, project finance and supply chains around large corporates. The credit risk management function will also be strengthened by on-boarding sector specialists and improving due diligence,” elaborated the SBI chief.
Kumar observed that the threat of competition from market competitors cannot be taken lightly, and the bank will leverage its balance sheet strength and pricing power to optimise the risk return matrix.
HR issues
HR issues, according to the SBI chief, need a fresh look as the usage of advanced digital technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data increases within the bank. The skill-sets of the employees needs to be upgraded in line with the changing operating environment.
“Given the pace of retirements in the next five years, it is important to put in place a robust plan of succession. Potential leaders will be identified and mentored through customised training programmes to create a strong leadership pipeline.
“Some of these works are already in progress, and concrete action plan will be implemented in the next two years,” said Kumar."

 Fitch Ratings today downgraded the Viability Rating (VR) of State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda by one-notch, reflecting weak risk profile due to negative effect of poor asset quality.
 Fitch, which has a negative sector outlook on Indian banks, however, affirmed the ‘BBB’ Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of SBI, BoB, Canara Bank and Bank of India (BoI) with a stable outlook.
 “Fitch has downgraded the Viability Rating (VR) of SBI and BoB by one-notch to ‘bb+’ and ‘bb’, respectively, reflecting their weakened intrinsic risk profile due to the negative effect of persistently poor asset quality and earnings on their capital position. The banks’ core capital buffers also appear more vulnerable to moderate shocks,” the ratings agency said in a statement.
 As many as 19 of India’s 21 state banks reported losses in the last fiscal, cumulatively wiping out almost all of the government’s $ 13 billion capital injections during the year, Fitch said.
 It said the one-notch downgrade of SBI’s VR to ‘bb+’ from ‘bbb-’ reflects the bank’s vulnerable core capitalisation from its prolonged asset quality problems and weak earnings.
 “We believe more fresh capital is needed for growth and to manage heightened balance-sheet stress,” Fitch said.
 SBI’s non performing loan ratio increased further to 11 per cent and have increased risk for core capitalisation, it added.
 With regard to BoB it said the one-notch downgrade of BoB’s VR to ‘bb’ from ‘bb+’ reflects increasing pressure on its capital position from extended financial weakness in terms of NPLs and earnings.
 Its NPL ( non-performing loan) ratio jumped to 12.3 per cent. The bank’s portfolio of watch-list loans is around 2% and can add to asset-quality pressure if NPL resolution slows, Fitch said."

Local refiners use SBI, the country's biggest bank, and Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH) to pay in euros for purchase of Iranian oil.
   -  Reuters


The fear of impending US sanctions on Iran has prompted the State Bank of India to stop processing payments for crude oil purchases. In a communication to public sector undertaking refiners, SBI has said that it will not be able to process payments for their crude oil purchases from November, according to officials in the know.
""We were told by SBI to intimate in advance if we had to make any payments from Iran. Now we have been told that payments for crude purchases cannot be processed from October end – November. This is on account of pressure from US sanctions on Iran,” a Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited official aware of the development told BusinessLine.
“We have also been steadily cutting our dependence on crude oil from Iran,” the official added.
Till now public sector refiners were routing their Iranian oil payment via SBI and Germany-based bank Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH). Industry watchers fear that continuing to facilitate payments for Iranian crude oil will hamper SBI’s interests in the US in light of the looming sanctions.
Alternative payment mechanisms
PSU oil refiners have been evaluating alternative options to process payments once US led sanctions on Iran kick in from November. SBI’s move will affect supplies that are due to take off in August.
The measures under consideration include the revival of the rupee payment mechanism that was facilitated by the UCO Bank when the previous round of US sanctions on Iran was in force. India has reportedly sought an exemption from the sanctions for crude oil and gas purchases. There have also been reports that India has challenged the US sanctions on Iran.
India’s crude oil imports from Iran had risen steadily to 27.2 million tonne during 2016-2017 from 11 million tonne during financial year 2014-2015. The rise in imports corresponded with the softening of US position with regards to Iran when the Islamic state agreed a long-term deal on its nuclear programme with the P5+1 group of world powers - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany in July 2015.
But dispute over the development of the Farzad B gas field with Iran prompted India to cut imports during the financial year 2017-2018. Till February 2018 end, crude oil imports from Iran stood lower at 20.4 million tonne, according to an official statement.
Sanctions impact
The Ministry of External Affairs has already reached out to other Ministries and Departments such as Finance, Commerce, Ports and Petroleum to work on a strategy to deal with the impact of the fresh economic sanctions imposed by the US on Iran.
In May this year, US President Donald Trump had decided to opt out of the nuclear accord that Iran had reached with the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany in 2015. According to the deal, Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow international inspectors in return for the lifting of economic sanctions that the Western economies had imposed on it.
Apart from opting out of the deal, the US has also imposed much harsher sanctions on Iran."

Supports could limit the downside in SBI(₹277.5)
SBI rallied as expected last week to test the key resistance level of ₹285. The stock surged over 6 per cent during intra-week to mark a high of ₹289.3. But SBI fell from this high, giving back most of the gains and closed 1.8 per cent higher for the week. The near-term view is negative. The stock can test the immediate support at ₹273. A break below this support can pull the stock lower to ₹270. Further break below ₹270 will increase the likelihood of the stock declining to ₹265 or even ₹262 in the short term. On the other hand, if SBI manages to reverse higher from ₹273 or ₹270, the downside pressure would ease. In such a scenario, the stock can rally to revisit ₹285 levels. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹285 will confirm the end of the downtrend that has been in place since last November. It will then pave way for SBI to target ₹310 and ₹320 levels. Indicators on the charts signal that the downside could be limited in SBI.










Bearish outlook is intact in ITC (₹264.5)
ITC was down for the fifth consecutive week. The stock surged to a high of ₹274 in the initial part of the week, but failed to sustain higher. It reversed sharply lower from its high, giving back all the gains made during the week. The fall has dragged the stock decisively below the 200-day moving average, which has been providing strong support over the last couple of weeks. ITC looks vulnerable to break below the immediate support at ₹263.5 and may fall to ₹260 or ₹258 in the coming days. The price action on the chart keeps the bearish outlook intact. The fall over the last five weeks indicates that the broader ₹250-₹290 sideways range is intact. ITC has been stuck in this sideways range for a prolonged period of time since last August. A fall to test ₹250 is possible in the coming weeks. However, such a fall is a good buying opportunity for long-term investors as a break below ₹250 is unlikely. Investors can hold the long positions and accumulate on dips at ₹255 and ₹252. Retain the stop-loss at ₹220.










Key resistance is ahead for Infosys (₹1,280.4)
Infosys surged to record highs in the past week, as expected. The stock recorded a high of ₹1,290 and has come-off slightly to close 1.6 per cent higher for the week. A key resistance is in the ₹1,295-₹1,300 region, which is likely to be tested in the near term. But whether Infosys breaks above this hurdle or not will decide the next move. Inability to breach ₹1,300 can trigger a short-term corrective fall. A pull-back from ₹1,300 can drag the stock lower to ₹1,250 or ₹1,230 on the back of profit-booking. However, the downside in the stock is expected to be limited as fresh buying interest is likely to emerge at lower levels. Strong support is at around ₹1,200. The outlook will turn negative only if the stock breaks below this support. But this looks unlikely. As such, an eventual break above ₹1,300 will boost the momentum. This can take the stock up to ₹1,370. From a long-term perspective, Infosys is likely to target ₹1,450. Both medium and long-term investors can hold their long positions.










RIL hovers below a crucial resistance (₹1,013.8)
RIL surged over 3 per cent last week. The stock has been rallying consistently over the last three weeks and is up about 10 per cent. A key short-term resistance is at ₹1,023. If RIL manages to breach this hurdle, the current rally can extend to ₹1,040 or ₹1,045 in the near term. Further break above ₹1,045 will pave way for the next target of ₹1,100 and higher levels. But inability to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹1,023 will increase the likelihood of a corrective fall in the coming days. A pull-back from ₹1,023 will drag the stock lower to ₹990. Further break below ₹990 will drag RIL lower to ₹965 or even ₹950 in the short term. Such a fall will keep the ₹870-₹1,020 sideways range intact. But indicators on the charts are bullish. The 21-day moving average is turning around after just testing the 55-day moving average. This is a positive signal, indicating that the downside could be limited. As such the possibility is high of the stock breaking above ₹1,023 and rallying to ₹1,045.










Immediate outlook is mixed for Tata Steel(₹565.9)
Tata Steel tumbled 6 per cent in the past week. The stock has been volatile over the last few weeks, moving up one week and falling in the next. This leaves the near-term outlook mixed for the stock. The stock can remain range-bound between ₹550 and ₹610 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹550 or ₹610 will then determine the next trend. Traders can stay out of this stock until a clear trend and a trade signal emerges. A strong break above ₹610 can take Tata Steel higher to ₹635 or ₹650 in the short term. A break above ₹650 is required to mark the end of the corrective fall that has been in place since late January. The stock can then target ₹680 and ₹700 levels again. On the other hand, if Tata Steel breaks below ₹550 in the coming days, it can fall to ₹539 — a key 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement support level. A break below this support can drag it to ₹525. Such a fall will strengthen the downtrend and drag the stock to ₹500 or ₹470."
284,2018-06-20,State Bank,"Corporate loan growth signals business revival 
After a long lull, corporate lending is witnessing a revival.
In recent years, loans to industries and businesses had been stalled due to macro-economic concerns and rising non-performing assets (NPAs).
However, the advances of some major banks indicate a perceptible change in approach to corporate lending.
For instance, the corporate loan portfolio of the State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, grew 1.80 per cent in the year ended March 31, 2018, at ₹10.11-lakh crore, against ₹9.93 lakh crore in the year-ago period.
This figure includes advances extended to large, medium and small enterprises. Large corporate loans accounted for a major chunk of this at ₹4.11 lakh crore (₹3.41-lakh crore).








 
The increase in off-take is discernible when compared to the previous year. For SBI, the increase in large corporate loans for 2016-17 was ₹11,854 crore, a figure the lender beat by a large margin in FY18, when the figure stood at ₹69,901 crore.
While growth in mid-corporate loans was muted in 2016-17, it had gone up ₹86,825 crore in FY18. A few other banks too show a similar trend.
The improvement in lending is more pronounced between the quarters of December 2017 and March 2018 when lending to large corporates grew 16.38 per cent and that to mid-corporates rose 14.46 per cent.
Punjab National Bank, India’s second-largest bank, also clocked an increase in loans to large industry, as lending rose to ₹1.34-lakh crore (₹1.29-lakh crore), besides a 6.5 per cent increase in disbursement of funds to MSMEs. Similarly, Canara Bank’s corporate credit grew 2.99 per cent to ₹1.38-lakh crore.
According to a senior SBI official, there has been renewed focus on corporate lending in the banking sector even while the retail credit segment is still being seen as safe bet, especially by smaller banks.
SBI has also been revamping corporate credit structure and systems. It has been broadening its client base, focussing on new segments, creating commercial clients group under two Deputy Managing Directors, and increasing product penetration among high-priority relations.
The completion of the restructuring of assets by many banks and speedy resolution of NCLT cases and expected good performance by agriculture this year might drive demand for corporate credit in the days to come.
Green shoots
However, bankers caution against reading too much into the trend.
“I think these are only green shoots,” said CVR Rajendran, Managing Director & CEO of Catholic Syrian Bank.
“The credit uptick in the corporate segment is mainly driven by the capex in consumer-driven industries such as automobiles, auto-ancillaries and agro-based industries. Steel and fundamental industries are slowly coming back. As yarn prices go up, textiles might do well,” he added.
It will take some time for things to look up fully. “The decision-making in a few public sector banks and a big private lender has been affected by recent controversies, and getting a loan for a new corporate project is still difficult,” he said."

 SBI managing director B Sriram has resigned from the country’s largest lender after his appointment as chief executive of IDBI Bank, sources said. The development assumes significance amid reports that insurance behemoth LIC is mulling acquiring a majority stake in the debt ridden state-owned bank.
The government last week appointed Sriram as managing director and CEO of IDBI Bank for a temporary period of three months.
He has put in his papers and his resignation from the board of SBI has been forward to Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for acceptance, sources said, adding the competent authority will take a final call on the matter.
Sriram took charge of IDBI Bank on June 22 following M K Jain demitting office to take over as Deputy Governor of RBI. The ACC approved the appointment of Sriram as MD and CEO of IDBI Bank for three months with effect from M K Jain’s demitting office, said an order issued last week by the Department of Personnel and Training.
IDBI acquisition
LIC is looking to enter the banking space by acquiring majority stake in IDBI Bank as the deal is expected to provide business synergies despite the lender’s stressed balance sheet. A possible scenario would be the insurance major making IDBI Bank a subsidiary on the lines of its housing finance and mutual fund businesses.
If the deal goes through, IDBI Bank would shed the character of public sector bank and become a private sector lender like Axis Bank. As per the Companies Act 2013, the upper age limit for MD and CEO in the private sector is 70 years.
Earlier this year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said the government’s decision on privatisation of IDBI Bank stands and it will be implemented at the right time. In his Budget speech for 2016-17, Jaitley had said the process of transformation of IDBI Bank has already started. “Government will take it forward and also consider the option of reducing its stake to below 50 per cent,” he had said.
Sriram is the longest-serving public sector bank MD and has wide experience, including in stressed assets management. IDBI Bank is grappling with mounting toxic loans with gross non-performing assets rising to a staggering Rs 55,600 crore at the end of latest March quarter. During the three months, the lender’s net loss stood at Rs 5,663 crore.
Sriram worked as the MD (Corporate and Global Banking) in SBI since July 2014. He had been Managing Director of State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur. Sriram joined the government-run bank in 1981 as a Probationary Officer. During over three-decade-long career, he held several positions and also had a stint at SBI’s Singapore office."

 State Bank chairman Rajnish Kumar, who is a member of the panel formed to give recommendations for setting up a state-run bad bank, today said they will soon submit the report to the finance ministry.
On June 8, finance minister Piyush Goyal had announced the formation of a committee under the chairmanship of Punjab National Bank non-executive chairman Sunil Mehta and the SBI chairman and Bank of Baroda managing director PS Jayakumar as members.
The minister gave the panel a fortnight to submit their report on the feasibility of setting up an asset reconstruction company (ARC)/an asset management company (AMC) for faster resolution of bad loans.
“We have crossed the deadline but 99 per cent of the work is over. After giving some finishing touches, it will be presented to the finance ministry soon,” Kumar told reporters here after the bank’s AGM here.
Goyal had said the panel would consider whether such an arrangement will be good for the banking system that is fighting its worst bad loan problem, and, if any such suggestion is advisable, it will also consider the modalities by which such an ARC/AMC should be set up.
Meanwhile, it has been learnt that SBI managing director B Sriram has resigned following his appointment as chief executive of the crippled IDBI Bank.
The Government had last week appointed Sriram as managing director and chief executive of IDBI Bank for three months.
 According to sources, Sriram has put in his papers and his resignation from has been forward to the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet headed by the prime minister for acceptance.
 Sriram, however, today refused to comment.
When asked Kumar about Sriram’s resignation, he said, “it is something that you should wait a little bit more. Earlier also we managed with three MDs many times.” 
Sriram took charge of IDBI Bank on June 22 following MK Jain demitting office to take over as a deputy governor of the RBI."

State Bank of India on Saturday said the government has granted permission to its Managing Director B Sriram to retire on voluntary basis. The retirement on voluntary basis is with effect from June 29 with entitlement to retirement benefits as prescribed in paragraph 27A of the Terms and conditions of Appointment of whole Time Directors of public sector Banks.
Sriram, who was earlier given additional charge of IDBI Bank as MD & CEO for three months, is expected to take full time charge of the Bank soon and chart out plans to revive its fortunes. This appointment follows the earlier MD & CEO MK Jain being appointed as Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor.
On Friday, the insurance regulator allowed Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to take 40 per cent more stake in loss-making IDBI Bank as a one time exception. The insurance behemoth has to bring down its stake in the public sector bank to 15 per cent over a period of time."

State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar is confident that the bank will come out of the bad loan problem with a stronger balance sheet in a year’s time. There will be more upfronting of provisions so that the pains are taken first, with gains coming in later. India’s largest bank, which had deposits of ₹27,06,343 crore, advances of ₹20,48,387 crore, 22,414 branches and 59,541 ATMs as of March-end 2018, is looking to optimise its balance sheet and increase the return on assets and pre-provision operating profit by growing its interest income, treasury returns, fee income and by reducing interest expense. In an interview with BusinessLine, Kumar, who took charge of the bank in October 2017, emphatically stated that “in (FY)2019, we will have profits for sure, 100 per cent. There is no doubt”. Edited excerpts:
What are your plans
for the bank?
A lot of things have happened in the last nine months. The immediate challenge was, of course, the asset-quality challenge. All steps are being taken with a long-term perspective. One is the immediate resolution, recovery and follow-up. That is being done with an eye on the short term. But the major change in the long term in SBI is the complete revamp of the corporate credit structure. The outline was done before March this year, but we have implemented it only in the first quarter because of our accounts finalisation.
The stressed assets resolution group (SARG) has also been overhauled. Earlier, our NPAs and stressed assets were scattered all over. Now, they have been brought under SARG.
The impact of this will be that our corporate accounts group (CAG), our commercial credit group (earlier called mid-corporate group), will be free from managing stressed assets, and will focus only on current business growth.
As for other initiatives, the digital blue-print is ready, and we are implementing it in a major way….These will give good cost-efficiency. This is the major change, and this has given us more confidence. We are confident that we will come out of the difficulties. We plan to increase our provision coverage ratio further. It is good now, and the intention is to improve it further. That is the whole gameplan. The balance sheet should be stronger next year.
What steps are you taking so that the bank is back in the black?
I think we are nearly there. Don’t look at the quarterly performance alone. There can be timing differences with regard to provisioning or recovery and that can result in variation. But as far as the operating income of the bank is concerned, we are seeing an improvement in the net interest margin (NIM).
The negative impact in treasury, due to mark-to-market provisions, is taken care of. We will have profits for sure in 2019, 100 per cent. There is no doubt.
We have to increase our operating income. So, we are working very systematically on managing our NIM. Last year, when the accounts got downgraded, there was a lot of impact on NIM.
So, that impact will not be there this year. On other income, there is a lot of focus. Among the changes that we have done in our CAG is to increase the fee-based income. And we have become much more conscious about pricing.
The budgeting which the bank has done, it is all around profitability. All measures will be taken to bring down credit costs. There will be more upfronting of provisions so that the pains are taken first, and the gains can come later.
You made a presentation to other public sector bank chiefs recently on mergers and acquisitions. What is your advice to them?
Honestly, I am not giving any advice. Let me make that clear. What I have done is I shared the experience we had. Tomorrow, if any of these banks decide to merge, they can have the benefit of that experience. But each bank is different. The experience has been shared – the difficulties and the pitfalls – whether in handling staff or customers.
Beyond that I don’t have any role. Of course, if any help is needed, as a member of the banking fraternity, we will do whatever is necessary.
What new initiatives are you planning in the retail banking space?
For retail, we have to get our channel strategy right. We are doing this and more and more emphasis is being placed on digital and alternative channels. And the product refinements keep on happening, depending on the market needs.
As far as retail reach goes, we have a very wide footprint in the country. Our distribution reach is unmatched. We are well-entrenched in the digital and payments space. So, going forward, retail will be a game of technology.
Can you throw more
light on this?
If you look at our digital bank YoNo (you need only one app), it is a banking super-store on your mobile. It gives you not only access to banking services, including opening of account online, creating fixed deposits, and recurring deposits, but also allows you to buy mutual fund, insurance and credit card and even trade on your account. So, everything is on one mobile application. It is a fantastic experience for the consumer. And further enhancements are happening.
Similarly, we are using technology for lead generation. We have a 43-crore customer base. So, using data analytics, we want to drive more value out of this huge customer base. Ultimately, we want to give convenience to those customers (new generation) who are tech-savvy, give a good experience to the people who still want to go to the branches.
So, the quality there itself should be improved. And small lending – consumer loans, pre-approved personal loans, housing loans and SME loans – will be fullydigital."

In a bid to increase its portfolio, SBI Cards plans to introduce four new products this fiscal. The second largest credit card issuer promoted by SBI, with 74 per cent stake, also intends to increase the number of card holders and bring down the delinquency rate to 1.9 per cent in 2018-19.
Currently, the delinquency rate is around 2 per cent in line with the industry, SBI Cards Managing Director Hardayal Prasad told PTI.
“Going forward, we will be launching few innovative products -- minimum 4 products, including co-branded card,” he said.
Last year, SBI Cards had launched four products, including a Doctor’s SBI Card. Prasad said that the company is issuing Rs 2 lakh new cards every month and the trend is likely to continue in the months to come. As on June 30, 2018, the total number of cards issued stood at 6.59 million.
To improve customer experience, the company has recently launched ELA (Electronic Live Assistant), a virtual assistant for customer support and services. Driven by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, ELA is designed to enhance customer experience by providing relevant and instant response to customer queries.
Customers can communicate with ELA in conversational language, enabling easy interface along with prompt query resolution. The virtual assistant is currently hosted on the SBI Card website and will soon be integrated on the mobile app as well, he said."

   -  THE HINDU




The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday passed the State Banks (Repeal and Amendment) Bill.
The legislation, which was passed in the Lok Sabha during last year’s Monsoon Session, will remove provisions in the State Bank of India Act pertaining to its erstwhile associate banks: State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Travancore and the State Bank of Hyderabad.
The Bill will repeal the SBI (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959, and the State Bank of Hyderabad Act, 1956. 
The Bill was passed unanimously. Minister of State for Finance Shiv Pratap Shukla told members that the merger of subsidiary banks will make SBI profitable, improve its working capital and aid it in offering better services. 
Opposition’s concerns
Earlier, participating in the debate, Opposition members shared their concerns over the problems in the banking sector. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said privatisation and de-nationalisation were no answers to the structural problems faced by the banks.
“I would like the Minister of State to give an authoritative statement on the behalf of the government that privatisation of banks or de-nationalisation of banks is not on government’s agenda,” Ramesh demanded. “We keep hearing from time to time that India requires lesser number of banks, banks should be merged. Sometime, we also hear that banks must be re-privatised,” he added.
CPI leader D Raja said the merger could have been avoided. “When the government decided to close down the five subsidiary banks and merge them with State Bank of India, we were told that this would make the State Bank of India a world-class bank and a stronger bank, but the story now is different. SBI is making losses. Hundreds of branches have been closed down in many parts of the country. NPAs have gone up,” he said.
The Opposition also criticised the Centre’s decision to initially introduce an Ordinance on the matter."
271,2018-07-19,State Bank,"Halt recovery of compensation from officers of erstwhile associate banks: SBI union
 Shishir Sinha


SBI officers’ union has come out in support of the officers of five erstwhile associate banks (e-ABs) on the issue of recovery of demonetisation compensation.
The union feels that such a move will create a kind of division among the officers and, accordingly, it has requested the management to “hold in abeyance the recovery of the amount already paid and enable us to discuss the issue amicably”.
“The amount involved is very small and a cost benefit analysis vis-à-vis the sentiments that it can affect will far outweigh the small cost involved,” read the letter written by the All India State Bank Officers’ Federation to the Deputy Managing Director and CDO of the State Bank of India. 
The letter further said that this was an emotional issue and “there should not be a division and hurt feeling among the E-Associate Bank officers”. The union made it clear that these officers are part of the SBI family. Despite repeated text messages and calls, the General Secretary of All India State Bank Officers’ Federation, Y Sudarshan, could not be reached for comments.
This newspaper, on July 9, reported that the SBI has instructed its various zones to recover the ‘compensation’ given to officers of its erstwhile associate banks for overtime work during the days of demonetisation in late 2016. 
Merger with SBI
It was said that “the compensation was meant for those working in SBI’s branches, and related to the period when the five associate banks functioned on their own”. Over 70,000 officers and employees became part of the SBI when its associate banks – State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur – merged with the parent bank on April 1, 2017. 
The communication had mentioned that the claim related to the period prior to the merger of e-ABs should have been dealt with by e-ABs at that time and “we have no record of any commitment to pay the same”. 
It had also mentioned that the instruction issued earlier this year for the payment of compensation was only in respect of those who worked in SBI branches. The management of SBI has not commented so far on this issue.
However, the union countered this and argued that after the merger, the onus of making payment to officers of e-ABs as and when payment was affected to officers, was with the bank. Therefore, when SBI decided to make payment and instructed the circles during March 2018, the circle also paid the officers of e-ABs without any discrimination. 
Moreover, “they clearly did not have any instructions (to) not make payment to E-Associate Banks”, the union said emphatically.
Many officers and employees were paid for working beyond 7 pm during the demonetisation period between November 14 and December 30, 2016. 
The compensation was different for each circle: for officers, it could be as much as ₹30,000, and for clerical and other staff, ₹17,000. The amount was paid as ‘out of pocket expense’ between March and May, 2018."
270,2018-07-23,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide
Near-term resistance ahead for SBI (₹260.9)
SBI fell initially last week, but managed to claw-back later. The stock tumbled about 3 per cent to make a low of ₹250.3 and reversed sharply higher, recovering all the loss. Near-term resistance is in the ₹263-265 zone. If the stock manages to breach ₹265 decisively, it can move up to ₹270 or ₹272 initially. Further break above ₹272 will turn the outlook positive. It will then pave the way for the next targets of ₹280 and ₹285. But inability to break above the ₹270-272 resistance zone can trigger a pull-back move to ₹263 or ₹260. The region between ₹257 and ₹255 is a crucial support to watch. SBI will come under pressure if it declines below ₹255 decisively. In such a scenario, the possibility will increase of the stock tumbling towards ₹240 or even ₹234 thereafter. Short-term traders with high-risk appetite can go short on a break below ₹255. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹263 for the target of ₹243. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹253 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹249.
Short-term outlook positive for ITC (₹270.4)
The support in the ₹267-₹266 region, as expected, limited the downside for ITC. The stock made a low of ₹266.2 and bounced back from those levels, recovering all the loss, and closed 1.1 per cent higher for the week. This retains the positive bias. The indicators on the chart are also positive. The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 200-day moving average and is on the verge of crossing over the 100-day moving average. This is a positive sign, indicating that the downside could be limited in the coming days. Resistance lies between ₹277 and ₹278, which is likely to be tested. A strong break above ₹278 will boost the momentum. Such a break can take ITC higher to ₹285 and ₹287. On the other hand, if the stock fails to break above ₹278, a pull-back move to ₹273 or ₹270 is possible. In such a scenario, the stock may remain range-bound between ₹267 and ₹277 for some time. The bias will, however, remain positive. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹220.
Bullish outlook intact for Infosys (₹1,348.3)
Infosys surged 3 per cent last week. The 21-day moving average at ₹1,306 continues to provide strong support. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if the stock declines decisively below the 21-day moving average. The next targets are ₹1,250 and ₹1,235. But such a fall looks less probable as the price action on the weekly chart last week indicates that Infosys is finding fresh buying interest around the psychological ₹1,300 mark. The stock retains its bullish outlook. There is also high probability of it sustaining above its the 21-day moving average support in the coming days. Immediate resistances are at ₹1,360 and ₹1,380. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹1,380 will pave the way for long-term targets of ₹1,450 and ₹1,475 levels. The ₹1,450-1,475 zone is a crucial long-term resistance region. Investors holding long positions should look to book some profits at these levels. Both medium- and long-term investors can book partial profits at ₹1,450.
RIL hovers below a key resistance (₹1,128.5)
RIL extended its rally for the second consecutive week and was up about 3 per cent. The stock has skyrocketed over 15 per cent over the last couple of weeks. A key resistance is near the current levels of ₹1,140-1,150, which is likely to be tested in the near term. Whether RIL breaks above ₹1,150 or not will decide the next move. A strong break above ₹1,150 will take the stock higher to ₹1,180. Further break above ₹1,180 will see the rally extending to ₹1,200 or even higher. On the other hand, if RIL fails to breach ₹1,150 in the coming days, it can come under pressure. In such a scenario, the possibility is high of the stock reversing lower on the back of profit-booking. A pull-back from the ₹1,140-1,150 resistance region can trigger a corrective fall to ₹1,060 or even ₹1,035 over the short term. The levels of ₹1,060 and ₹1,035 are key short-term supports that are likely to limit the downside. A fall below ₹1,035 looks less probable at the moment as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at lower levels.
Downtrend is intact for Tata Steel (₹503.4)
Tata Steel plummeted 10 per cent last week. The sharp fall in the past week has dragged the stock well below the crucial support level of ₹540. Cluster of resistances between ₹530 and ₹550 can cap the upside as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels. A fall to ₹475 or ₹470 is likely in the coming days. Short-term traders can wait for a bounce back and go short at ₹525 and ₹540. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹560 for the target of ₹475. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹510 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹495. The region between ₹475 and ₹470 is a crucial support for Tata Steel. The 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level and a long-term trendline supports are poised between this region. A rally from this support zone can trigger a relief rally to ₹530 and ₹550. But a break below ₹470 will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹425 or even ₹400 thereafter. As such, the price action around the ₹475-470 support zone will need a close watch."
268,2018-07-26,State Bank,"With eye on debt recovery, SBI asks DoT not to revoke RCom’s spectrum
Fearing a massive haircut on its loans, State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, has moved the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), asking it to reconsider its decision to revoke the spectrum allocated to debt-ridden Reliance Communications (RCom) and Reliance Telecom (RTL).
SBI, which is part of a consortium of lenders to RCom, has maximum exposure, as lead lender, to the beleaguered telecom company.
In its letter to DoT, SBI said RCom’s spectrum, along with other telecom infrastructure and assets, is proposed to be sold to Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio). The proceeds of the sale will be used to clear RCom’s debt of ₹45,000 crore.
“In the event of the proposed sale process not culminating due to the possible revocation of spectrum allocation by DoT, the lenders may not be able to recover the funds lent, thereby causing irreparable harm to SBI and all other lenders in the consortium,” SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said in the letter to DoT, a copy of which was viewed by BusinessLine.
“We understand from RCom and Reliance Telecom that DoT appears to be contemplating revocation of spectrum allocated to both the companies due to non-submission of bank guarantees that is to be submitted by the companies on expiry of earlier bank guarantees…,” it said.
It added that DoT should not initiate “coercive action”, as the lenders are in talks with the companies for a possible re-issue of bank guarantees.
The accounts of RCom and RTL have become non-performing assets (NPAs) for the lenders, and the consortium has initiated debt-resolution plans and asset-monetisation plans to recover the dues.
Fresh bank guarantees
In a show-cause notice dated July 22, DoT had sought reasons for not revoking spectrum assigned to RCom and RTL in the auctions held in 2013 and 2015. It had also sought fresh bank guarantees of ₹774 crore for not revoking the spectrum.
“We request DoT to reconsider the decision to initiate coercive action including the revocation of spectrum allocation, which (reconsideration) will help lenders in recovering the debts owed by RCom and RTL,” SBI said.
RCom has also moved the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) against the DoT. The matter has been posted for hearing on August 10. SBI had earlier urged the NCLT to dismiss a plea by unsecured lenders to put RCom under insolvency."

State Bank of India has clarified that one could convert his/her Savings Bank (SB) account to a Basic Savings Bank Deposit (BSBD) account to avoid penalty for not maintaining average monthly balance (AMB).
The bank has given the clarification in response to a report in BusinessLine dated August 4 highlighting a total penalty of over ₹11,500 crore collected by public and private sector banks from customers for not maintaining AMB in the last four years.
SBI alone collected over ₹2,400 crore during 2017-18. Now, SBI has said that SB accounts, such as PMJDY/BSBD, and of pensioners/ minors/ social security benefit holders are exempted from the AMB requirement, and that charges would not be recovered from these accounts.
The bank has around 42.5 crore SB accounts, of which almost 40 per cent are under the exempted category. Customers also have the option to convert their existing SB accounts to BSBD accounts, free of cost.
It also reiterated that effective April 2018, the AMB requirement has been reduced up to 40 per cent, keeping in view the feedback from various stakeholders. Similarly, the bank has steeply reduced charges for non-maintenance of AMB up to 70 per cent in metro/urban and semi-urban categories. Charges in rural market were also reduced up to 75 per cent.
It claimed that its charges for non-maintenance of AMB is among the lowest in the industry.

   -  REUTERS


 


State Bank of India has decided to shift its Central Accounts Office (CAO) from Kolkata to its corporate headquarters in Mumbai. 
The CAO came into existence after the formation of Imperial Bank of India following the merger of the three presidency banks of British India, and primarily looked into compilation and finalisation of the bank’s annual balance sheet and quarterly and half-yearly profit and loss accounts. 
It was set up in Kolkata as Bank of Bengal (which started off as Bank of Calcutta), and was the biggest among the presidency banks. In 1955, the Central government took over the Imperial Bank of India under an Act of the Parliament and renamed it as State Bank of India. As per the Act, it was decided that while the bank’s headquarters would be in Mumbai, the Central Accounts Office would continue to be in Kolkata. 
It is to be noted that till 2017, the annual balance sheet was signed by the bank’s central board and its auditors in Kolkata. However, in a break from years of tradition, the bank, in 2018, decided to relocate its annual board meeting from Kolkata to its corporate headquarters citing “logistics issues”.
The ‘Save SBI CAO Kolkata Forum’ has already written to the top management against this “sudden and drastic decision” of shifting the CAO from Kolkata."

“The surplus return is positive because it will improve the fiscal mathematics of the government,” Siddharth Sedani, Vice-President and Head of Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi, said.
The money will help the government to step up public spending, improve tight cash conditions and cool bond markets.
“Banks will benefit from this because it will help improve Treasury income,” he added, indicating the impact of better cash conditions on bond yields

Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, State Bank of India




Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, State Bank of India


State Bank of India reported a net loss of ₹4,876 crore in the first quarter ended June 30, 2018, as provisions, including towards investment depreciation and staff expenses, soared. The bank had posted a net profit of ₹2,006 crore in the year-ago period.
The net loss was, however, lower than the ₹7,718-crore loss in the preceding quarter thanks to a ₹2,379-crore write-back in income-tax.
While the loan-loss provisions were up 7.53 per cent y-o-y to ₹13,038 crore, fresh slippages at the country’s largest lender were down to ₹9,984 crore during the quarter against ₹33,670 crore in the preceding quarter. Corporate slippages (including from the textiles, power, roads & EPC sectors) were at ₹3,704 crore while the balance came from the retail, small and medium enterprise and agriculture sectors.
Gross NPAs declined by ₹10,587 crore during the quarter to ₹2,12,840 crore. As at June-end 2018, GNPAs edged down to 10.69 per cent of gross advances (from 10.91 per cent as at March-end 2018). Net NPAs declined to 5.29 per cent of the net advances (from 5.73 per cent as at March-end 2018).
Chairman Rajnish Kumar said the requirement for provisioning on account of the legacy NPA accounts had been largely taken care of. The bank expects to post a profit in the December and March quarters.
“...All the provisioning, or what I call all the pains, all the blows, we are taking upfront... so that future earnings are protected.
“Some of the power assets (seven of them) we are trying to resolve in this quarter. So, if that happens, the provisioning gets advanced... If we resolve them, then whatever is the gap between the provision held and the estimated recovery, that will need to be provided in the September quarter,” he said.








 
The net interest income (the difference between the interest earned and paid) was up 24 per cent year-on-year at ₹21,798 crore (₹17,606 crore). The non-interest income was down 16.57 per cent y-o-y at ₹6,679 crore (₹8,006 crore). This was mainly due to a loss of ₹1,264 crore on sale of investments (against ₹1,770 crore profit under the same head) and a lower forex income of ₹427 crore (₹667 crore).
The net interest margin improved to 2.80 per cent in the June 2018 quarter against 2.50 per cent in the preceding quarter.
SBI attributed the loss to lower trading income and significant mark-to-market (MTM) losses due to hardening of bond yields and higher provisioning on account of wage revision and enhancement in the gratuity ceiling.
The bank said it has not availed itself of the benefit of the RBI dispensation on amortisation of MTM loss.
Staff expenses increased by 26 per cent y-o-y to ₹9,708 crore during the quarter mainly on account of provision for wage revision and enhancement in gratuity ceiling. The provision for investment depreciation shot up to ₹7,098 crore (against a write-back of ₹755 crore in the year-ago quarter).
Advances up
Domestic advances registered 7.21 per cent y-o-y growth to ₹17,23,443 crore. Gross advances, including overseas loans, were up 5.49 per cent y-o-y to ₹19,90,172 crore.
“Credit growth is still largely coming from retail. But we have a fairly robust pipeline as far as corporate loan demand is concerned,” said Kumar.
Deposits increased by 5.58 per cent y-o-y to ₹27,47,813 crore."

Morgan Stanley expects large corporate lenders to move from impaired to growth fairly quickly. Motilal Oswal has raised concerns on SBI's exposure to power, but says the bank remains comfortable due to its largest exposure toward PSU entities and top-rated private corporates.

   -  THE HINDU


After much yo-yoing, the stock of SBI plummeted nearly 4 per cent, post its June quarter results. What initially appeared to be a lower-than-expected slippage number turned out to be a not-so-comforting addition to SBI’s bad loan book. While the bank reported a lower ₹9,984 crore of fresh slippages in the June quarter (as against ₹33,600 crore in the March quarter, due to one-time impact of the RBI’s circular), it disclosed increase in outstanding NPA accounts to the tune of ₹4,300 crore. Hence the total accretion of ₹14,300 crore (fresh slippages plus increase in outstanding NPAs) in the June quarter to bad loans is an elevated number. 
The bank’s still large watch-list, increasing non-corporate slippages and possible impact of the RBI’s diktat that requires banks to report even one-day defaults and draw up resolution plans within 180 days — are concerns. Non-corporate slippages in the June quarter were the highest (barring post-merger impact last year) in the last two years. 
The bank’s core performance remained weak, with domestic loans growing by a tepid 7 per cent in the June quarter. SBI’s 24 per cent growth in net interest income was thanks to a one-off recovery. Higher NPA provisioning and significant marked-to-market losses on investments in government bonds led the bank to report a loss of ₹4,876 crore in the latest June quarter."

Notwithstanding the huge provisioning, piled up debt and ongoing cases in the National Company Law Tribunal, the country’s biggest lender SBI expects to be back on course to profitability from the September quarter.
“We had made huge provisions and believe the worst is over. Instead of making provisions over several quarters, we decided to take a hit once and for all. Now, we expect to do well from the September quarter itself and end the financial year on a profitable note,” said Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, State Bank of India.
Speaking to mediapersons here today, the SBI Chairman said: “Apart from provisioning, we have had to take a hit due to mark-to-market accounting. But having taken some bold decisions to make provisions, we are confident of doing well during the quarter and the fiscal.”
“The cases in NCLT I and II are at various stages, along with efforts to resolve some of the issues related to bad assets in the power sector. There has been good interest in the power sector, and it won’t be long before you will get to know about resolution of some of these cases,” he said.
When asked about the issues faced by Jet Airways and the reported proposal by Vijay Mallya to resolve issues related to pending dues, the SBI chief said: “We have not received any proposal and would not like to get into specific cases. In any case, when a proposal comes, we look at it with open mind.”
Corporate lending
“Lately, our lending focus was on consumers, home loans, personal and retail loans, and now there has been growing interest to lend to the corporate sector. We expect to see improvement in corporate lending and loans to SMEs,” said Rajnish Kumar. 
“Our advances are over ₹20-lakh crore and even if there were 10 per cent growth in lending, it will work out to additional ₹2-lakh crore growth,” he said.
 “The banking sector is witness to a phase of rapid changes and a paradigm shift in the way we bank and lend. The entire ATM network is being revamped and upgraded to ensure the network’s cyber security,” added Rajnish Kumar. 
Recruitment
The SBI chief said the bank is in the process of recruiting 8,000 people in the clerical grade and about 2,000 as probationary officers. “We expect this process to be completed during the fiscal, and the overall staff strength will be round 2.5 lakh to 2.6 lakh,” he explained.
Nearly one crore people get added to the job market every year, and entrepreneurship is one area that is driving creation of new jobs. The government’s Mudra loans have brought about a sea change in creating a new generation of entrepreneurs, he said."

The State Bank of Travancore was one of SBI’s former associate banks, which merged with the parent bank on April 1, 2017

State Bank of India has instructed its various zones to recover the ‘compensation’ given to officers of its erstwhile associate banks for over-time work during the demonetisation days in late 2016.
According to the SBI communication, seen by BusinessLine, the compensation was meant for those working in SBI’s branches, and related to the period when the five associate banks functioned on their own.
Over 70,000 officers and employees became part of the SBI when its associate banks — State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur — merged with the parent on April 1, 2017.
“The claim related to the period prior to the merger of e-Abs (erstwhile Associate Banks) should have been dealt by e-Abs at the material time and we have no record of any commitment to pay the same,” the communication said, adding that instruction issued earlier this year for payment of compensation was only in respect of those who worked in SBI’s branches.
SBI did not respond to queries from BusinessLine.
Some of these employees were paid compensation for working beyond 7 pm during the demonetisation period between November 14 and December 30, 2016. The compensation was different for each circle: For officers it could be as much as ₹30,000, and for clerical and other staff ₹17,000. The amount was paid as ‘Out of Pocket expense’ between March and May.
The communication, to the Deputy General Manager in-charge of office administration, asked the officer to review the position and “examine under what circumstances approval was given for the payment of compensation to the officers of e-ABs”. It also asked to arrange to “recover where wrong payments have been made.” It made it clear that “if it warrants, appropriate action may be initiated against the erring official.”
Unions unhappy
Bank unions expressed unhappiness over the move, saying the amounts were paid after almost a year, and after repeated requests to the Indian Banks Association. Recovery of the amount was grossly unjust, they said.
Said one employee: “Normally, a merger means taking over the assets and liability. Now, if there is any liability towards staff on account of working beyond service hours, how can the parent SBI deny that?”
Another officer said: “Why is the management creating a rift among staff? We feel demoralised.”"

Moves that create discrimination will affect employee morale




Moves that create discrimination will affect employee morale


When a corporate merger takes place, there are always sticky issues of discrimination that come up. It’s natural for people in the acquired entity to feel like stepchildren, and the acquirer has to tread warily. State Bank of India has, however, managed to trample on many toes by sending out a letter asking employees of five erstwhile associate banks to return the compensation given to them for overtime work during the days of demonetisation in late 2016. 
Over 70,000 officers and employees became part of the SBI when its five associate banks — State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur — were merged with it on April 1, 2017.
The letter in which SBI has instructed its various zones to recover the ‘compensation’ given to officers of its associate banks for overtime work has led to questions being raised about differential treatment among employees, post-merger. SBI employees haven’t been asked to return the money.
“Agar wapas lena tha toh diya kyon? (If you wanted to take it back, then why did you give?),” said a bank employee who had to return the amount. Shouldn’t a merger mean taking on the liabilities as well as the assets?
When questioned, officers in the Finance Ministry said that it was an operational matter. “Besides, if it is honorarium, then the banks themselves know how to deal best with it,” an official associated with the Ministry said.
In a letter dated July 18, SBI officers’ union came out in support of the officers of the associate banks on the issue of recovery of demonetisation compensation. The union felt that moves like this would create discrimination among the employees.
The letter written by the All India State Bank Officers’ Federation to the Deputy Managing Director and CDO of the SBI said that the amount involved is very small, but a cost-benefit analysis vis-à-vis the sentiments that it can affect shows that the latter will far outweigh the small cost involved.
The compensation was different for each circle: for officers, it was as high as ₹30,000, and for clerical and other staff, ₹17,000. The amount was paid as ‘out of pocket expense’ between March and May, 2018.
While some officials wanted to downplay the issue, stating that both the management and the employees are making efforts to amicably resolve it, the incident does bring to fore the challenges of synergising the work cultures of distinct entities. Any mis-step can lead to loss of goodwill.
The government’s silence on the issue has only alienated workers more. Ashwani Rana, Vice-President of the National Organisation of Bank Workers, says, “There are two or three issues here. There is an issue of no proper re-imbursement; there are instances of some people claiming it twice; and many banks have not given the overtime to all employees. A situation like this is happening because the government is not taking up the cause of the bank employees.”
Whatever be the case, all are agreed that the action was not in good taste. Aashish Chandorkar, a public policy commentator, says: “Retrospective orders are not good from a corporate governance perspective, there can always be a provision aligned with the best practices for future. Undoing incentives with back-dated effect impacts employee morale.”
He adds, “Employee incentivisation should be clearly spelt out. This is an area to be addressed as per the Indradhanush framework. Greater professionalism across the ranks is important.” (Indradhanush framework was a comprehensive plan for revamping public sector banks, announced in August 2015.)
While the reimbursement issue is a relatively minor one, there are larger issues looming ahead. All India Bank Employees Association General Secretary C H Venkatachalam says, “Today more and more contractual jobs are being preferred to regular jobs, also compassionate appointments — many genuine cases are going unheard. The macro issues need to be addressed along with the rest.”
Ashwani Mahajan, National Co-Convener of Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, an affiliate of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh, feels that corporate governance issue is not just restricted to banking sector. There has to be clarity and things examined from a larger perspective post merger, he said.
As Chandorkar sums it up, an audit of finance, legal, HR practices, and harmonisation with best practices in the industry, coupled with uniform application of processes when M&As happen, will become very important if the government embarks on the stated aim of having fewer public sector banks.
Amidst all this, the banks need to remember that people are intangible assets and have to be nurtured with care."

249,2018-09-02,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (₹308.8)








 
SBI inched higher in the initial part of the week and then remained range-bound for the rest of the week. The stock closed 2.8 per cent higher for the week. Though the daily candle chart gives a mixed outlook, the weekly chart is bullish. A key near-term resistance is at ₹312. Inability to breach this hurdle and a subsequent fall below ₹303 — the 21-day moving average support — can drag the stock lower to ₹290 in the short term. But the downside is likely to be limited as a break below the ₹290-285 support cluster is unlikely. On the other hand, if SBI manages to break above ₹312, an up-move to ₹320 can be seen. The level of ₹320 is a key short-term resistance. A strong break and a decisive close above this hurdle will boost the momentum. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹350 or even ₹370 over the medium term. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions. Retain the stop-loss at ₹283. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹318.
 
ITC (₹319.1)








 
The uptrend in ITC remains intact and is gaining momentum. The stock surged 2.8 per cent last week and closed at a key resistance level of ₹319. A pull-back in the initial part of the week can take the stock lower to ₹315 or ₹312. But further fall below ₹312 looks unlikely at the moment. The levels of ₹312 and ₹307 are significant supports for ITC, which are likely to limit the downside in the short term. A bounce back from either ₹315 or ₹312 will increase the likelihood of the stock breaking above ₹319 decisively. Such a break can take ITC higher to ₹327 — the next crucial resistance level. As mentioned last week, a strong break above ₹327 will give the stock fresh momentum. In such a scenario, ITC will gear up for a fresh rally to ₹360 over the medium term. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Short-term traders who have taken long positions at ₹297 can hold with a stop-loss at ₹303. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹308 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹321. Book profits at ₹330.
 
 
Infosys (₹1,440)








 
Infosys surged over 4 per cent last week. The 21-day moving average is continuing to provide strong support. This support has been limiting the downside in the stock consistently since April. Immediate resistance is in the ₹1,447-1,450 region. Inability to breach ₹1,450 can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹1,400 or ₹1,390. But a strong break above ₹1,450 can take Infosys higher to ₹1,490 or ₹1,500. The region between ₹1,490 and ₹1,500 is a key resistance. A corrective fall after testing this resistance region cannot be ruled out. Long-term investors can book partial profits at ₹1,480 and keep the stop-loss for the rest of the holdings at ₹1,360. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions, retain the stop-loss at ₹1,360 and book profits at $1,485. The uptrend in Infosys will come under threat only if it declines below the 21-day moving average (₹1,393) support decisively. Such a break will trigger a fall to ₹1,350 . Further break below ₹1,350 can then drag the stock to ₹1,320 or even lower thereafter.
 
 
RIL (₹1,240.9)








 
RIL began the week on a positive note and surged about 4 per cent intra-week to record a high of ₹1,328. However, the stock lost momentum and reversed sharply lower, giving back all the gains made and closed 3 per cent lower for the week. The near-term outlook is negative. Resistance is around ₹1,280. As long as the stock remains below ₹1,280, the possibility of the stock breaking below ₹1,229 — the 21-day moving average — is high. Such a break can take RIL lower to ₹1,210 initially. A strong break below ₹1,210 will turn the outlook to negative. In such a scenario, a sharp fall to ₹1,160 or even lower levels is possible on the back of profit-booking. On the other hand, if RIL manages to reverse higher from the immediate support levels of ₹1,229 or ₹1,210, the downside pressure may ease. A bounce-back move to ₹1,260 or ₹1,270 is possible in that case. A decisive break and close above ₹1,270 will bring back the bullish momentum. It will then increase the possibility of the stock revisiting ₹1,300 and ₹1,320.
 
 
Tata Steel (₹601.6)








 
Tata Steel surged 4.6 per cent last week, recovering all the loss made in the earlier week. With this up-move, the stock has regained its strength. Support is in the ₹593-₹590 region, which is likely to limit the downside in the near term. A break below ₹590 can drag the stock lower to ₹570 or ₹565. But such a fall looks less probable as the indicators on the chart are positive . The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 100-day moving average. This is a bullish signal. Immediate resistance is at ₹619 . The possibilityof the stock breaking above this hurdle is high. Such a break can will see the current uptrend extending to ₹625 and ₹635 levels in the coming days. The region between ₹635 and ₹640 is a crucial resistance. A strong break and a decisive weekly close above ₹640 will confirm that the downtrend that has been in place since January has reversed. As such, the price action around the ₹635-₹640 resistance region will need a close watch to get a cue on the direction of the next move."
248,2018-09-03,State Bank,"Madras HC raps banks for granting crores to firms without adequate security 
 The Madras High Court slammed public sector banks Monday for granting crores of rupees as loans without sufficient security to several firms “when people are begging for educational and farm loans“.
The court’s stinging observations came when it was hearing a plea filed by the State Bank of India in the Rs 820 crore debt recovery proceedings against Kanishk Gold Private Limited seeking quashing of attachment proceedings by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against the firm .
When the petition by the SBI’s Stressed Assets Management branch came up, Justice R Mahadevan posed a host of questions to the counsel for the bank.
The court said it will issue necessary orders to arrest all the officials and persons involved in the “scam.” 
“It is public money. The people are begging for education and farm loans after offering security.
“Do not try to safeguard the officials of the bank in this case and nobody can escape under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 (also known as SARFAESI Act). We will set an example by passing order in this case to whole country,” the court said.
The judge asked whether bank officers verified documents before sanctioning loan to the firm.
“What is the total amount of loan sanctioned? What is the worth of properties offered for security?” it asked.
The court directed counsel for the ED, who filed a counter affidavit, to collect details about the “involvement of officials, investigate and file a report in detail.” 
The matter was posted for further hearing to September 17.
 The counsel for the SBI submitted that there was “dereliction” of duty on behalf of the officers who investigated the case.
 In its counter, the ED said: “As per the forensic audit, there are misrepresentation/falsification of records, diversion of funds and disposal of the stocks by the company.” 
 “The total loss caused to the banks due to the above fraud works out to the tune of Rs 824.15 crore (outstanding as on December 31, 2017 plus interest). The security available with banks to cover the said loss is to the tune of Rs 158.65 crore only, being realisable value of the immovable properties,” it said.
 The matter relates to the loan granted to the firm by the public sector banks, including the SBI, to the tune of Rs 700 crore which accumulated to Rs 820 crore with interest up to March 15, 2018.
 The banks took action under the SARFAESI Act and took symbolic possession of nine properties.
 The SBI and its consortium banks also lodged a complaint before the CBI, it was submitted.
 Bhupesh Kumar Jain, one of the directors of the firm, was arrested by the Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence for alleged evasion of duty.
The ED director had passed an order freezing the properties during search and seizure under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
 The agency had also passed a provisional attachment order attaching all secured properties under the PMLA.
The SBI moved the court, submitting that by effecting the provisional attachment order, the ED had “scuttled the frantic efforts” of the banks from realising public money.
The ED counter said it is indicated that the bank officials failed to “exercise their due diligence before sanctioning and extending the bank loans to the borrowers named in the FIR registered by CBI, BS & FC, Bangalore,” 
“Hence, it is not only case of NPA, but a case of criminal conspiracy, cheating, fraudulence by the said borrowers along with officials of the consortium of banks herein, and others and therefore the loan proceeds are nothing but proceeds of crime involved in money laundering.” 
Instead of availing statutory remedy available under section 8(1) of the PMLA, the petitioners filed the plea, which is liable to be dismissed, the counter said."

There is a risk of power assets further losing value once they are referred to the NCLT.
   -  The Hindu Business Line


Lenders led by SBI are preparing to take 11 stressed power assets to the bankruptcy court next week with the RBI’s deadline for initiating insolvency proceedings fast approaching, sources said.
“SBI has called for a meeting of lenders on Thursday to discuss starting insolvency proceedings against 11 accounts, which were earlier supposed to be resolved outside the NCLT,” said an industry source who did not want to be identified.
He added that lenders arrived at this decision based on advice from legal experts.
The move follows Allahabad High Court last week denying power companies relief from the RBI’s February 12 circular tightening the norms for resolution of stressed assets.
“Even though in many of the cases resolution was almost achieved and buyers were almost finalised, RBI guidelines are very clear on the deadline, and banks have no option but to take those assets to the NCLT,” said another person with knowledge of the development.
An SBI-led consortium of bankers, earlier this year, shortlisted 11 power plants with up to 15,000 MW total capacity for change of management under the scheme of asset management and debt change structure or Samadhan scheme. Projects of Lanco Infratech, Jaypee Power Ventures, KSK Mahandi, Coastal Energy, Avantha Power, SKS Power and Prayagraj Power were among those assets selected for the scheme.
In fact, Prayagraj Power has emerged as one of the first cases where resolution was about to be finalised outside the NCLT. Last week, Tata Power and ICICI Venture-promoted Resurgent Power announced receiving Letter of Intent from the lenders of Prayagraj Power, which was earlier promoted by Jaiprakash Associates. However, JSW Energy, another bidder for the 1,980 MW thermal power plant, revised its bid to ₹6,200 crore from its earlier bid of ₹5,890 crore.
Industry sources suggest that in cases like Prayagraj where the resolution plan is almost finalised but not yet fully implemented or did not yet get a majority vote from the lenders, there is no time left to complete the process and, hence, initiating insolvency proceedings is the only way.
Industry watchers, however, warn there is a risk of power assets further losing value once they are referred to the NCLT.
Experts also note that very few power assets have so far got resolved, indicating the limited number of buyers for these assets as well as the limited opportunity that these assets provide to investors. Only those assets with PPAs and fuel arrangements could possibly be looked at by investors, and there is just a handful of such assets out of around 40 stressed assets identified earlier."

 State Bank of India will sell eight non-performing assets to recover dues worth over Rs 3,900 crore and has invited bids from asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) and financial institutions (FIs).
“In terms of the bank’s revised policy on sale of financial assets in line with the regulatory guidelines, we place these accounts for sale to ARCs/banks/NBFCs/FIs, on the terms and conditions indicated,” the bank said in the bid document on its website.
Of the eight accounts on the block, Kolkata-based Rohit Ferro Tech has the highest loan outstanding against it at Rs 1,320.37 crore, followed by Indian Steel Corporation Ltd at Rs 928.97 crore; Jai Balaji Industries at Rs 859.33 crore and Mahalaxmi TMT Pvt Ltd at Rs 409.78 crore.
The remaining accounts belong to Impex Ferro Tech (Rs 200.67 crore), Kohinoor Steel Pvt Ltd (Rs 110.17 crore), Modern India Concast (Rs 71.16 crore) and Ballarpur Industries (Rs 47.17 crore).
SBI has asked the interested ARCs/FIs to conduct the due diligence of these assets with immediate effect after submitting expression of interest and executing a non-disclosure agreement with the bank.
 The e-bidding for these accounts will take place on September 26. Earlier in August, the lender had put two non-performing assets (NPAs) worth Rs 2,490 crore for sale to ARCs/FIs.
The two accounts on sale were -- Bombay Rayon Fashions Ltd which owed Rs 2,260.79 crore to the bank. The second account, Shivam Dhatu Udyog Pvt Ltd, had to repay Rs 229.32 crore.
In April, SBI had invited bids to sell 12 sour accounts to recover dues worth Rs 848.54 crore.
SBI’s gross NPAs rose to 10.69 per cent of the total advances at the end of June this year, as against 9.97 per cent a year ago. In value terms, they increased to Rs 2,12,840 crore, from Rs 1,88,068 crore.
In the first quarter ended June of the current fiscal, SBI has reported a hefty loss of Rs 4,876 crore due to higher NPAs or bad loans.

 A recent SBI communication to ArcelorMittal, questioning its locus standi to repay a $48-million loan availed by the steel giant’s erstwhile group entity, Uttam Galva, may become another stumbling block for the Lakshmi Mittal-owned company in its bid for stressed asset Essar Steel.
ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel maker, is engaged in a pitched battled with Russia’s VTB Bank-promoted for the control of Essar Steel.
In February, ArcelorMittal Netherlands had sold its entire 29 per cent stake in Uttam Galva to the Miglani family for ₹1 and agreed to pay back the loan facility availed by the latter to make itself eligible for Essar Steel.
The State Bank of India also pulled up ArcelorMittal for breaching the non-disposal agreement signed as a sponsor for the Uttam Galva loan facility.
However, a company spokesperson denied any wrongdoing. “ArcelorMittal divested its passive shareholding in Uttam Galva following all due processes. ArcelorMittal firmly believes that there has been no violation of a non-disposal agreement,” said a spokesperson for the company.
As per the credit facility agreement, the SBI letter in April said the primary obligation to pay interest and all other outstanding principal amount is on Uttam Galva.
“We understand from your (ArcelorMittal) correspondence that you have deposited money in an offshore account standing in your name at SBI, London. Therefore, please let us know in what manner lenders can accept the amount deposited by you in an offshore account maintained by you towards the dues of Uttam Galva under the credit facility agreement, if all lenders choose to accept,” it said.
It added: “Please note that any acceptance of the amount deposited by you may be subject to regulatory consents, which ought to be procured by Uttam Galva and you.”
“We would like to state that your choice of depositing any amounts towards the Uttam Galva dues...is your independent choice and shall not be considered to have any bearing with the plan submitted by you under the Essar Steel resolution,” said SBI.
“The choice of depositing the money against Uttam Galva dues does not in any manner imply that we are condoning the breaches under various financing documents including Non-Disposal agreement,” it said. Such deposit will also not have any bearing on insolvency proceedings initiated by SBI against Uttam Galva under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, said the letter.
Uttam Galva was declared a non-performing asset in September 2016 after it defaulted on its ₹6,000-crore debt. SBI initiated bankruptcy proceedings against the company in the National Company Law Tribunal last year."
240,2018-09-20,State Bank,"Plethora of promotions from SBI to other PSBs has bankers worried
With the Centre reposing a lot of trust in top SBI officials to helm public sector banks (PSBs), they will be keenly watched — on how they steer their banks when most of them are grappling with bad loans, have turned conservative in lending, and are looking at ways and means to raise capital to provide for soured loans and to meet minimum regulatory capital prescriptions.
Out of the 10 top PSB officials elevated on Wednesday as MD & CEO of various banks, five are SBI Deputy Managing Directors and the remaining are Executive Directors of other PSBs.
Even within the remaining five EDs, two were Chief General Managers with the erstwhile associate banks of SBI before being elevated as ED in other PSBs.
The SBI DMDs who have been appointed MD & CEO of other PSBs are — Padmaja Chunduru (Indian Bank), Mrutyunjay Mahapatra (Syndicate Bank), Pallav Mohapatra (Central Bank of India), J Packirisamy (Andhra Bank) and Karnam Sekar (Dena Bank).
The nationalised bank EDs who move as chiefs of other PSBs are Ch SS Mallikarjuna Rao (from Syndicate Bank to Allahabad Bank), AS Rajeev (from Indian Bank to Bank of Maharashtra), Atul Kumar Goel (from Union Bank of India to UCO Bank), S Harisankar (from Allahabad Bank to Punjab & Sind Bank) and Ashok Kumar Pradhan (elevated in United Bank of India itself).
Harisankar and Pradhan were CGMs with the erstwhile State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, respectively, before they became EDs.
These appointments clearly show the Centre is betting on the skills and experience that top SBI officials could possibly bring to the job to turn around the fortunes of the PSBs. But then this has caused consternation among top PSB officials, who feel they are getting crowded out by SBI official when it comes to board level appointments.
A top PSB official observed that if SBI officials are a cut above the rest of the public sector bankers, then their bank shouldn't have been sailing in the same NPA boat as the rest.
Referring to the appointments, CH Venkatachalam, General Secretary, All India Bank Employees' Association, said: “One wonders whether it is due to dearth of talent in the nationalised banks or due to abundance of talent in SBI or is there some other reason which does not meet the normal eye. In any case this is bound to demotivate the senior officials in the nationalised banks. At least the government should consider vice versa — posting of senior officials from nationalised banks to SBI to ensure fair play and parity.”
Earlier instances of SBI talent occupying top positions in PSBs have been far and few between. Even then only SBI MDs, which is a board level position, moved as CMD, and not DMDs.
SBI MDs who helmed other PSBs include MG Bhide (Bank of India CMD in the late 1990s) and Yogesh Agarwal (IDBI Bank CMD in 2007-10). Also, SBI veteran B Sriram is now heading IDBI Bank as MD & CEO.
Top PSB officials underscored that the latest appointments have catapulted some without board level experience directly into the corner room at PSBs. They fear that if this trend continues, none of the PSB officials could rise beyond GM in the future.
The Centre should also ensure that India's largest bank imports talent from other PSBs, they added.
Alternatively, in order to create more room at the top, they suggest that SBI's 16 local head offices, many of which have business equal to a mid-sized PSB's total business, could be upgraded so that instead of CGMs, DMDs could helm them. Further, instead of DMDs, MDs could head the subsidiaries so that a good career progression is assured for SBI officials."

 SBI (₹270) 
SBI plummeted 7 per cent last week breaking below the key support levels of ₹275 and ₹270. The stock made an intra-week low of ₹253.6 and recovered some of the loss before closing the week at ₹270. Near-term resistances are at ₹275 and ₹278. As long as the stock trades below ₹278, the outlook will remain negative and a fall to ₹256 is possible. A bounce from ₹256 can take the stock higher to ₹270 levels again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹256 and ₹278 is possible. But if SBI breaks below ₹256 decisively, it will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹245 or ₹243 in the coming weeks. Traders can go short if SBI reverses lower from the ₹275-278 resistance region. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹291 for the target of ₹245. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹270 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹260. The outlook for the stock will turn positive only on a strong rise past ₹278. In such a scenario, a relief rally to ₹287 and ₹290 is possible.










 ITC (₹303.7) 
ITC managed to stay afloat amid a strong sell-off in the broader markets last week. The stock made a smart recovery after falling about 3 per cent intra-week and closed just 1 per cent lower for the week. This reflects the inherent strength in the stock. It will come under pressure only if it declines below ₹295. The next targets are ₹290 and ₹285. But as long as ITC sustains above ₹295, the broader uptrend will remain intact. Immediate resistances are at ₹307 and ₹309. A strong break above ₹309 will take ITC higher to ₹317 or ₹321 over the short term. Further break above ₹321 will then target ₹327 — the next crucial resistance level. As being reiterated over the last few weeks, a decisive break above ₹327 will boost the momentum and trigger a fresh rally to ₹360 over the medium term. Investors can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Traders with a medium-term perspective can make use of dips to go long at ₹298 and ₹293. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹270 for the target of ₹355.










Infosys (₹706.3)
Infosys tumbled 4 per cent last week. The sharp fall over the past week has taken the stock decisively below the 21-day moving average support that has been limiting the downside over the last five months. It also indicates early signs of the uptrend, that has been in place since September 2017, getting reversed. The region between ₹718 and ₹720 is a key resistance, which has to be breached to ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take Infosys higher to ₹740 and ₹750 levels again. But as long as the stock remains below ₹721, there is a strong likelihood of it breaking below the crucial support level of ₹690 in the coming days. Such a break will confirm the trend reversal and drag Infosys to ₹660. Further break below ₹660 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹630 and ₹625. Short-term traders with high-risk appetite can go short on a bounce to ₹710 and ₹717. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹732 for the target of ₹670. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹695 when it moves to ₹685.










 RIL (₹1,216.8) 
 RIL fell, breaking below the key support level of ₹1,225 and closed about 3 per cent lower for the week. A complex head-and-shoulder reversal pattern is visible on the chart. This is a bearish pattern indicating a reversal of the current uptrend .The neckline resistance of this pattern is poised around ₹1,237. Also, another key resistance is at ₹1,253. The outlook will turn positive only if RIL manages to breach ₹1,253. This will see the stock revisiting ₹1,300 and ₹1,320 levels. But as long as the stock trades below ₹1,253, a fall to ₹1,175 or ₹1,170 cannot be ruled out in the short term. A bounce from the ₹1,175-1,170 support zone can trigger a relief rally to ₹1,200 and ₹1,220. But a break below ₹1,170 will increase the likelihood of the stock falling to ₹1,100. Traders with a medium-term perspective can wait for a bounce and go short at ₹1,225 and ₹1,245. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,265 for the target of ₹1,120. Revise the stop-loss to ₹1,205 when the stock moves down to ₹1,190.










 Tata Steel (₹615.3) 
Tata Steel seems to have remained insulated from the broader market sell-off. Though the stock tumbled about 6 per cent intraday on Friday, it managed to recover all the loss and close the week 1.5 per cent higher. Key resistance is at ₹640. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹680 and ₹700 thereafter. But if the sell-off in the broader market intensifies, the upside in this stock could be capped at ₹640. In such a scenario, Tata Steel can remain range-bound between ₹575 and ₹640 for some time. The outlook will turn negative only if Tata Steel declines below ₹575 — the 21-week moving average. Such a break can drag it to ₹550. But the price action on the chart indicates that the stock is likely to sustain above ₹575. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹560. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹620 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹635. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹635 as soon as Tata Steel moves up to ₹655."

Any decision to support cash-strapped IL&FS will be taken by State Bank of India’s board keeping in view the larger interest of the banking and financial services industry as well as protecting the bank’s own shareholders’ interests, according to Chairman Rajnish Kumar.
These comments come in the backdrop of insurance behemoth Life Insurance Corporation of India assuring that it will do all it can to prevent the collapse of beleaguered IL&FS, which has now begun to implode and started to renege on several of its repayment obligations.
As a leader in the banking and financial services industry, Kumar said SBI will do everything that helps in stabilising the financial system. Life Insurance Corporation of India and State Bank of India have 25.34 per cent and 6.42 per cent stake, respectively, in IL&FS.
Debt-laden IL&FS, and some of its subsidiaries, have seen their ratings downgraded by credit rating agencies in the last one month.
Defaults on debt (commercial papers and intercorporate deposits) by these entities have had a cascading impact on the financial system, with some mutual funds pressing secondary market sales of non-convertible debentures of non-banking finance companies at higher yields to meet redemption pressures.
“So that (stabilising the financial system) is where our obligation or responsibility or duty is….there has to be a concrete proposal (from IL&FS) and that has to be examined by SBI.
“And SBI’s board will take a decision in the larger interest…of the industry as well as protect SBI’s own shareholders’ interests,” said Kumar on the sidelines of an event to launch Apollo SBI Card, a co-branded credit card in the healthcare segment.
On the Supreme Court’s verdict, which said Aadhaar is not mandatory for opening bank accounts, Kumar observed that Aadhaar is a very convenient mode for opening a bank account. Today, on SBI’s digital channels, an account can be opened with an Aadhaar card within five minutes and the account becomes operational.
“Now this (Aadhaar) is not mandatory….But from the services point of view, I believe, it is a great facility. And today, we open 27,000 accounts per day digitally with no paper work. Within five minutes you can operate the account.
“And once the biometric details are captured, it becomes a full-fledged service account. So, we have to see the convenience, but it has to be with the customer’s consent and there cannot be any compulsion,” said the SBI chief."

233,2018-10-01,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (₹265)
SBI was range-bound between ₹261 and ₹274 and closed 1.8 per cent lower for the week. The bias remains negative and any intermediate bounce in the coming days could be short-lived. A strong break below ₹261 — the 200-week moving average — can take the stock lower to ₹255. If SBI manages to bounce from ₹255, a relief rally to ₹270 is possible. But a strong break below ₹255 will increase the downside pressure. Such a break will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling to ₹245 thereafter. On the other hand, if SBI sustains above ₹261, a bounce to ₹275 is possible. The region between ₹275 and ₹277 is a key resistance zone. A strong break above ₹277 is needed to ease the downside pressure. This break will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹285 over the short term. Traders with a high-risk appetite can go short on rallies at ₹273 and ₹276. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹291 for a target of ₹245. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹267 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹259.










ITC (₹296.7)
ITC shares fell 2.3 per cent and were down for the fourth consecutive week. Clusters of moving average and trendline supports are poised in the ₹290-₹280 region, which is holding well for now. ITC made a low of ₹289.5 last week and bounced from there. If the stock sustains above ₹290, an up-move to ₹305 and ₹307 is possible. A strong break above ₹307 will take the stock up to ₹317 or even ₹321 over the short term. It will confirm the end of the corrective fall that has been in place since early September. But if ITC reverses lower from the ₹305-307 resistance region, it can fall back to ₹295 and ₹290 levels again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹290 and ₹307 is possible for some time. A break below ₹290 can take ITC lower to ₹285 and ₹280. Investors can hold their long positions and retain the stop-loss at ₹265. Medium-term traders who took long positions last week on dips at ₹298 and ₹293 can hold them. Retain the stop-loss at ₹270 for a target of ₹355.










Infosys (₹727.8)
Infosys surged 3 per cent last week, recovering most of the loss made in the week earlier. The sharp bounce in the past week has triggered the stop-loss on the short positions recommended last week. The price action over the past two weeks leaves the immediate outlook unclear for the stock. Key support is at ₹690 and resistance is in between ₹740 and ₹750. Infosys can remain in a broad sideways range between ₹690 and ₹750. A breakout on either side of ₹690 or ₹750 will then decide the next move. A strong break above ₹750 can take the stock higher to ₹757 initially. A break above ₹757 will then take the stock fhigher to ₹770 thereafter. On the other hand, if the Infosys stock breaks below ₹690, it can come under selling pressure. This break will drag the stock lower to ₹660 on the back of profit-booking. It will also confirm that the uptrend since August 2017 has reversed. Further break below ₹660 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down-move to ₹630 and ₹625










RIL (₹1,258.2)
Contrary to expectations, RIL surged over 3 per cent last week. The short positions recommended last week have been stopped out on the strong bounce-back move witnessed last week. The head and shoulder reversal pattern mentioned last week has got negated. A key support is at ₹1,242. As long as the stock remains above this support, an up-move to ₹1,280 is possible. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,280 will boost the momentum. Such a break will then pave way for a fresh rally to ₹1,350 or even higher levels. The bullish outlook will get negated if RIL declines below ₹1,242 decisively. Such a break can drag the stock lower to ₹1,200 or ₹1,195 in the near term. Further break below ₹1,195 will then increase the likelihood of the downmove extending to ₹1,185 or ₹1,180. The level of ₹1,180 is a crucial long-term trend-line support for the stock. The uptrend that has been in place since the beginning of this year will come under threat if RIL declines below ₹1,180.










Tata Steel (₹580.35)
Tata Steel tumbled over 7 per cent last week. The stock is poised above a crucial support level of ₹575. Whether Tata Steel bounces from this support or not will determine the next move. A bounce from ₹575 will ease the downside pressure. In such a scenario, an up-move to ₹605 or ₹615 can be seen in the near term. An inability to breach ₹615 levels can drag the stock to ₹590. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹575 and ₹615 can be seen. But if Tata Steel manages to breach ₹615, it can extend its rally to ₹637 and ₹640 thereafter. On the other hand, if Tata Steel breaks below ₹575, it can fall to ₹559. Further break below ₹559 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹540 or ₹535 thereafter. Medium-term traders can retain their long positions. Keep the stop-loss at ₹560. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹605 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹613.

SBI, according to its latest annual report, continues to be the top acquirer in the country in terms of number of terminals with a market share of 20.20 per cent.


 State Bank of India on Monday said that it has executed a business transfer agreement in respect of transfer of its existing merchant acquiring business (MAB) to its wholly owned non-banking finance subsidiary, SBI Payment Services Pvt Ltd. 
MAB is primarily referred to as the mechanism of providing necessary infrastructure and facilitating the payment for goods and services purchased through medium of a card.
Various stakeholders in MAB include the issuer (of cards), cardholder (customer/non-customer using card for making payment), merchant (entity which accepts payments through cards), acquirer (the bank providing necessary infrastructure to the merchant to accept payment), and intermediary agency (Visa/MasterCard/RuPay which facilitate interbank settlements).
SBI, according to its latest annual report, continues to be the top acquirer in the country in terms of number of terminals with a market share of 20.20 per cent. 
In FY2017-18, the India's largest bank had introduced two new digital payment acceptance products - Bharat QR (quick response) and BHIM-Aadhaar-SBI, and on-boarded 2.02 lakh and 4.97 lakh merchants, respectively on these platforms. 
PoS (point of sale terminals) deployed by SBI grew from 5.09 lakh as on 31st March, 2017 to 6.10 lakh as on 31st March, 2018. In total, the number of merchant payment acceptance touch points of the bank crossed 1.96 million as on 31st March, 2018.

230,2018-10-01,State Bank,"SBI’s curb on cash withdrawal limit to boost UPI transactions
Digital transactions, especially through Unified Payment Interface (UPI), is likely to get a further boost in the coming months, with the country’s largest public sector lender State Bank of India (SBI) deciding to halve the daily cash withdrawal limit to ₹20,000 per day from October 31.
Experts feel that the decision by SBI, which has over 42 crore customers, will lead to an almost 50 per cent jump in UPI transactions.
“We expect over 50 per cent jump in UPI transactions and also IMPS. People are more likely to use UPI for big-ticket transactions, too, due to the curb on withdrawal limits. Other banks are also likely to follow suit in the coming days,” said a top official engaged with payment-related activities.
National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an umbrella organisation for operating retail payments and settlement systems in India, which was created under the provisions of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, launched the UPI last year and, so far, over 151 banks and other financial institutions in the country have gone live with it. It did not comment on the subject. SBI, in a statement, said that the curb on withdrawal limits was to check frauds and also boost digital transactions, which have seen a rise after the introduction of demonetisation in 2016 and the launch of UPI last year. Monthly transactions through UPI increased by over 30 per cent month-on-month to 40.58 crore in volumes in September at ₹59,835 crore, as per recent data shared by the NPCI.
In August, about 31.20 crore UPI transactions were recorded at ₹54,212.26 crore. Government-backed BHIM UPI registered 1.63 crore transactions worth ₹7,064.86 crore in September, compared to 1.65 crore transactions (totalling ₹6,872.57 crore) in the previous month.
The rest came from banks and other PPIs, including mobile wallets.
Alibaba-backed Paytm, a leading mobile wallet player in the country, has registered over 13.7 crore UPI transactions in September, contributing over 33 per cent of the overall transactions, the company claims, while Flipkart’s PhonePe has not shared its September numbers."

Following the hike, the one-year MCLR, which is the benchmark rate to which most of the loans, including to the retail, SME and corporate segments, is 8.50 per cent against 8.45 per cent earlier.
That lending rates are going up is underscored by the fact that in November 2017, the one-year MCLR of India's largest bank was 7.95 per cent. In March 2018, this rate moved up to 8.15 per cent."

The co-ordinated action by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), National Housing Bank (NHB) and SBI to open the liquidity tap to domestic lenders, even if it comes quite late in the day, is a good move to shore up shaky market confidence in the NBFC sector. While the RBI’s move to conduct open market operations of ₹36,000 crore this month may mainly help banks, NHB’s decision to raise its refinancing limits to ₹30,000 crore (from ₹24,000 crore) may serve as a limited lifeline to housing finance NBFCs, which are expected to face the highest negative gaps in their operating cash flows in the next six months. SBI’s plan to double its planned purchases of securitised loan portfolios this fiscal to ₹30,000 crore can free up much-needed cash, for the NBFCs which manage to wrangle these deals. Overall, these measures may help NBFCs to paper over their immediate liquidity crisis and perhaps moderate the market’s risk perception of them. 
While the role of the RBI and NHB in throwing a lifeline to NBFCs is understandable, given that they are regulators responsible for systemic stability, SBI’s decision to be co-opted into this rescue package is curious. It no doubt makes business sense for universal banks, without niche lending skills, to acquire ready-made portfolios of micro-finance loans, crop loans or commercial vehicle loans from NBFCs specialised in last-mile lending, to meet their own priority sector targets or even bump up their yields. But then, this decision needs to be made strictly on commercial lines, with the bank driving a hard bargain on the acquisition price and building in significant buffers for defaults. In the current market context, a bank would be prudent to relieve NBFCs only of their high-quality assets, while staying off deals involving unsecured loan, personal loan or loan against property (LAP) portfolios, where credit risks are believed to lurk. One hopes that SBI will be making its decisions on these lines, without caving in to any extraneous pressures to expedite its due diligence or bail-out specific NBFCs. Any such bailout would carry a strong moral hazard. After all, NBFCs should have been well aware of the risks of relying on the whimsical commercial paper market to finance their breakneck growth. 
However, while throwing NBFCs a liquidity lifeline may stave off the immediate problem, the fundamental problem of Indian NBFCs (and other financial institutions) facing a dearth of longer-term financing avenues for their long-gestation exposures remains unaddressed. Commercial banks, both in the public and private sectors, have proved to be sorely lacking in both project and credit appraisal skills. Of late, NBFCs have taken to directly tapping retail investors with public issues of long-dated bonds. But after the IL&FS fiasco, one wonders if retail investors would again be let down by the rating agencies, on whom they overwhelmingly rely for assessments of these bonds. A clean-up of the credit ratings ecosystem is imperative for SEBI, before this trend takes wing."
227,2018-10-14,State Bank,"Festive sale: SBI customers to get additional discount, cash back on YONO 
 The SBI customers will get additional discounts and cash back on shopping through its digital platform YONO, as the lender wants to cash in on the festival season shopping spree.
 YONO -- acronym for You Only Need One -- is the SBI’s digital app for various services.
 Apart from paperless banking, it offers investment in financial products and customers can also do shopping as the bank has on-boarded over 85 e-commerce players on YONO platform.
 The SBI said it is the first ever bank to have come up with a digital shopping festival, in which it will offer discounts up to 10 per cent and cash back to customers using SBI credit and debit cards during October 16-21.
 These discounts will be over and above what e-commerce players would offer to SBI customers during the sale.
 “Our discounts of 10 per cent and cash back on purchases through SBI credit and debit card will be over and above the discounts up to 50 per cent offered by the top 14 e-commerce players on host of products ranging from fashion to furniture,” SBI Managing Director PK Gupta told PTI.
The SBI said customers will get exclusive and best in class offers from these top 14 e-commerce merchants in the YONO shopping festival (YSF). It will also offer financing options to all SBI customers.
YSF deals include categories such as electronics, fashion, gifting, jewellery, furniture, travel, hospitality among others. Amazon, Jabong, Myntra, Kalyan, Caratlane, PCJ, Pepperfry, OYO, Tata Cliq, Yatra, Easemytrip, Firstcry, IGP, Ferns & Petals are among top digital marketplaces, as per the SBI’s exclusive partnership for YSF.
 “We are doing a lot of things on YONO apart from banking. Lots of innovation is also happening, like we already have pre-approved loan on YONO which does not require a customer to visit a branch. So, we thought in the festival season it is a good idea to come up with a digital shopping offer to our customers with additional discount benefits,” Gupta said.
 The bank’s one stop YONO platform was launched in November 2017 and is about to complete an year.
 Gupta said the bank is witnessing good traction over YONO, particularly the younger generation customer which enthuses SBI to come up with such offerings.
 There are already 3 million customers on board YONO and the bank is adding about 25,000 new customers on this platform per day, he added.
 SBI said YSF is the first digital banking platform to offer customised products and services from around 85 e-commerce players by leveraging analytics.
 YONO can be accessed through Android and iOS powered mobile phones, and on the web through a browser, an omni-channel for host of products apart from banking."

 In wake of the IL&FS crisis, efforts are underway by the Indian government, RBI as well as SBI to try and stabilise the system very quickly , and things are likely to return to normal in a couple of weeks, SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said here.
 Kumar said that the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) was a unique institution operating in the infrastructure financing and construction space.
 It is an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor, holding assets as well as its finances - it was a 3-in-1, Kumar said, adding that whether it is banks or non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), if they are in infrastructure financing, they have faced trouble in India.
 Infrastructure, particularly the BOT (build—operate—transfer) model, has caused a lot of problem even to the banks. We ourselves have suffered in the financing of infrastructure, Kumar said during an interactive session at the 9th ‘New India Lecture’ organised at the Indian Consulate under the aegis of Consul General Sandeep Chakravorty. 
 The lecture series is organised by the Consulate in partnership with the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF).
 Responding to a question on IL&FS and the impact of shadow banking on the Indian economy, Kumar said since it is an NBFC, it has had a contagion effect. 
 Because of the IL&FS default, there is pressure on mutual funds. The corporates who were providing liquid funds to mutual funds have become very cautious. In turn, the mutual funds have become cautious about their investments, he said.
 Kumar added that in wake of the IL&FS crisis, the SBI stepped up in a big way. 
“This is how we are trying to stabilise the system and tackle the situation. The RBI has announced measures around improving liquidity for NBFCs. The government, RBI and SBI - all of us are trying that the system stabilises very quickly.”
 “I believe it is a matter of time - a couple of weeks when things return to normal,” he said. 
 IL&FS and its subsidiaries have defaulted on several debt repayments recently due to liquidity crisis. It needs an immediate capital infusion of Rs 3,000 crore and is also planning a Rs 4,500-crore rights issue. 
 The company as of March 2018 owed over Rs 91,000 crore to banks and other creditors. On October 1, the government superseded the board of IL&FS and appointed a new board, with banker Uday Kotak as its executive chairman.
 On the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, introduced in 2016, Kumar said he considers it the most significant reform that the current government has carried out. 
 It’s a new law, a new process. So obviously, there are some hiccups because there are issues around how the provisions of the code are interpreted,” he said. 
 It is very hard for the existing promoters to believe that there is a law and a real threat of them losing control of the business. It’s never happened in India in the past. That’s where the fight is, but this was very badly needed, he said.
 He said, going forward, the litigation will come down and the resolution will happen within the time frame of 180-270 days. 
 For this process to succeed, it is important that cases are referred at the earliest sign of trouble. Definitely there’s a paradigm shift in the creditor-debtor relationship in India, he added.
 He said as a potential weapon, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code works very well, but we have to be careful before we exercise it. The threat works much better than the actual resolution."

218,2018-10-30,State Bank,"SBI halves daily ATM withdrawal to Rs 20K for certain card holders from Wednesday 
 SBI has halved the daily cash withdrawal limit from ATMs for certain debit-card holders to Rs 20,000 from Wednesday.
 The withdrawal limit has been curtailed on Classic and Maestro debit cards, held by a large number of the bank customers.
 However, customers with other variants of SBI debit card can continue to enjoy higher daily withdrawal from ATMs.
 As per a senior SBI official, the average cash withdrawal from ATMs per card is less than Rs 20,000 and the move will help in checking frauds and promote digital transaction.
 About a month ago, the State Bank of India (SBI) had alerted its customers holding Classic and Maestro debit cards regarding reduction of cash withdrawal limit to Rs 20,000 a day from ATM starting October 31.
 The SBI had put out the following message on its website: 
“Daily cash withdrawal limit for Classic and Maestro debit cards has been reduced from Rs 40,000 to Rs 20,000 per day with effect from October 31.
 “If you require higher daily cash withdrawal limit, please apply for a higher card variant.” 
SBI Managing Director PK Gupta had said the reduction in withdrawal intends to protect customers from fraudulent cash withdrawals from ATMs and also to spur more digital transactions.
 “We analysed all the ATM transactions and we found that most of them are less than Rs 20,000 a day. In case of frauds reported to us, we found that in all such cases withdrawals of Rs 40,000 (the maximum) have happened. So, this is basically to protect the customers and secondly, we want that more digital transactions should happen,” Gupta had said."
217,2018-11-01,State Bank,"SBI withdraws insolvency against Uttam Galva
State Bank of India on Thursday filed an application with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to withdraw insolvency proceedings against Uttam Galva Steels, as ArcelorMittal has repaid the defaulted amount.
To make itself eligible as a bidder for Essar Steel, ArcelorMittal had offered to pay ₹7,469 crore to clear the dues of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, in which it had held minor shareholdings earlier.
Having divested its stake completely in both the companies, it is not yet clear how ArcelorMittal will regain control in both the distressed assets, said sources who confirmed the development.
Uttam Galva, owned by the Miglani family, specialises in cold rolled steel and has an annual capacity of 1.2 million tonnes.
A clutch of 18 banks led by SBI had lent ₹6,000 crore to Uttam Galva, and dragged it to the NCLT after it defaulted on its loan last year."

The committee of the directors for capital raising has accorded approval to allot Basel III compliant debt instruments qualifying as tier 2 capital of the bank, SBI said in a regulatory filing.
As per the bond programme, the bank will issue 41,159 non-convertible, taxable, redeemable, subordinated, unsecured debt instruments in the nature of debentures of face value of Rs 10 lakh each, bearing coupon of 8.90 per cent per annum aggregating to ₹4,115.90 crore, it said.

215,2018-11-04,State Bank,"SBI puts up 11 NPA a/cs for sale to recover Rs 1,019 cr 
 SBI has put up 11 non-performing assets (NPAs) for sale to ARCs and financial companies to recover dues of nearly Rs 1,019 crore.
The country’s largest lender said the e-auction of these NPA accounts will take place on November 22. 
“In terms of the bank’s policy on sale of financial assets in line with the regulatory guidelines, we place these accounts for sale to ARCs/ Banks/ NBFCs/ FIs,” SBI said in an auction notice on its website.
Of these 11 accounts, Janki Corp Ltd has the highest outstanding dues of Rs 592.53 crore. Among others, Venus Remedies Ltd has to repay Rs 83.01 crore, SBS Transpole Logistics Pvt Ltd has to repay Rs 63.36 crore, R S Luth Education Trust has dues worth Rs 60.62 crore, Nilachal Iron & Power Ltd has to repay Rs 52.41 crore and Sri Balmukund Polyplast with Rs 50.12 crore. The rest of the five companies owe the bank the remaining Rs 117 crore.
The interested asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and financial institutions (FIs) can conduct due diligence of these assets with immediate effect, after submitting expression of interest and executing a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with the bank, State Bank of India (SBI) said.
Once the deal is finalised, the assignment deed and other legal formalities will be completed in the shortest possible time as mutually agreed upon, it added.
SBI’s gross NPAs rose to 10.69 per cent of the total advances at the end of the first quarter ended June this fiscal year, as against 9.97 per cent a year ago. In value terms, they increased to Rs 2,12,840 crore, from Rs 1,88,068 crore. The bank has reported a hefty loss of Rs 4,876 crore for the June quarter due to higher NPAs or bad loans."
214,2018-11-04,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (₹285.4)
SBI skyrocketed 15 per cent last week. The stock tested the ₹290-292 resistance region on Friday and has come-off slightly after making a high of ₹292.65. As long as it trades below ₹292, an intermediate dip to ₹280 or ₹276 cannot be ruled out. Key supports are at ₹279 and ₹276. A strong break below ₹276 can drag SBI initially to ₹268. A further break below ₹268 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹260 or ₹257 over the short term. On the other hand, if SBI manages to bounce from ₹276, the outlook will remain bullish. In such a scenario, the possibility of the stock breaching above ₹292 will be high. A strong break above ₹292 will trigger a fresh rally to ₹311. A further break above ₹311 can then take SBI to the next target of ₹322. Short-term traders with a high-risk appetite can go long on dips at ₹282 and accumulate at ₹279. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹271 for the target of ₹305. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹285 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹292.










ITC (₹282.3)
ITC fell in the initial part of last week, but managed to bounce from the low of ₹273.15. The price action on the chart indicates that the stock is getting fresh buying interest below the support level of ₹275. This keeps the bias positive. An up-move to ₹287 and ₹292 is likely in the near term. Inability to breach ₹292 can drag it to ₹280 and ₹275 again. In such a scenario, a range-bound move between ₹275 and ₹292 can be seen for some time. But a strong break above ₹292 can take ITC higher to ₹298 and ₹300. A further break above ₹300 will then pave way for the next target of ₹307. The bullish outlook will get negated only if ITC makes a decisive close below ₹275. Such a break will increase the possibility of the stock falling to ₹270 or even ₹265 in the coming days. Traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹283 and ₹280. Retain the stop-loss at ₹273 for the target of ₹298. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹285 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹289.










Infosys (₹662)
Infosys surged over 9 per cent intra week, but failed to sustain higher. The pull-back from ₹693.9 indicates that the stock is getting fresh sellers at higher levels. Near-term resistance is in the ₹680-682 region. As long as the stock trades below this resistance zone, a fall to test the key support level of ₹630 is possible again. If Infosys manages to bounce from ₹630, it can remain range-bound between ₹630 and ₹700. However, the outlook will continue to be negative as long as the stock remains below ₹700. An eventual break below ₹630 can drag Infosys lower to ₹600 and ₹590. Traders can hold the short positions taken at ₹670 and ₹675. Retain the stop-loss at ₹710 for the target of ₹600. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹665 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹655. The outlook will turn positive only if the stock manages to rise past the psychological level of ₹700. The next targets are ₹720 and ₹730. However, such a strong up-move looks less probable at the moment.










RIL (₹1,074.2)
RIL traded in a narrow range between ₹1,047 and ₹1,093 last week. The near-term outlook is unclear. Immediate resistance is in the ₹1,088-1,090 region. If RIL manages to breach ₹1,090 decisively, an up-move to ₹1,130 or ₹1,135 is possible. A strong break above ₹1,035 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its rally to ₹1,185 or even ₹1,200. But a pull-back from ₹1,135 can drag the stock lower to ₹1,080 and ₹1,050 and keep it range-bound between ₹1,030 and ₹1,135 . On the other hand, if RIL fails to breach ₹1,090, it can break below the near-term support level of ₹1,050 and fall initially to ₹1,030. A further break below ₹1,030 will increase the selling pressure and drag RIL to ₹1,010 and ₹990 thereafter. Traders who have taken short positions at ₹1,075 and ₹1,085 on rallies last week should remain cautious. Stop-loss can be lowered to ₹1,105. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹1,060 as soon as RIL declines to ₹1,045. Book profits at ₹1,015.










Tata Steel (₹573.7)
Tata Steel tumbled about 4 per cent intraweek to make a low of ₹530. However, it managed to reverse higher sharply, recovering all the loss, and closed over 4 per cent higher for the week. A key resistance is at ₹583. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹595 and ₹600. It will also confirm an inverted head and shoulder pattern on the chart. A pull-back from the ₹595-600 region can find support in the broad ₹580-₹570 region. An eventual break above ₹600 can then target ₹615 and ₹625. On the other hand, if the stock reverses lower from ₹583, it can fall to ₹570 or ₹565. A further break below ₹565 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹550 and ₹540. Traders holding short positions at an average price of ₹561 should remain cautious and revise the stop-loss lower to ₹585. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹557 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹552. Book profits at ₹540."
213,2018-11-05,State Bank,"SBI net profit slips 69% to Rs 576 crore in Q2 
The country’s largest lender SBI on Monday reported 69 per cent decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 576.46 crore in the second quarter ended September 30. The bank’s net profit was Rs 1,840.43 crore in the July-September quarter of previous fiscal.
The bank had reported a net loss of Rs 4,875.85 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal due to higher provisioning for bad loans. Its total income (consolidated) rose to Rs 79,302.72 crore in the quarter under review, compared to Rs 74,948.51 crore in the year-ago period, State Bank of India (SBI) said in a regulatory filing.
On asset quality, the gross non-performing assets (NPA) of the bank rose to 9.95 per cent of the gross advances as on September 30, 2018 from 9.83 per cent a year ago. Net NPAs or bad loans stood at 4.84 per cent of the net advances, down from 4.53 per cent.
The provisions for bad loans came down to Rs 10,381.31 crore during the quarter, from Rs 16,842.18 crore in the same period a year ago. On standalone basis, the bank’s net profit was down at Rs 944.87 crore as against Rs 1,581.55 crore. The lender’s income was Rs 66,607.98 crore in the July-September quarter, up from Rs 65,429.63 crore.

Committed to a cause State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar




Committed to a cause State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar


 After posting three consecutive quarters of losses, State Bank of India has turned the corner in the second quarter of FY2019, logging a standalone net profit of ₹945 crore, on the back of higher credit growth and lower slippages.
While the net profit in the quarter was up vis-a-vis net loss of ₹4,876 crore in the preceding quarter, it was down 40 per cent compared with the year ago quarter.
“The bank has returned to profit after three quarters of losses…Though it (net profit) is modest but I can assure you there is no looking back. This number is going to be bigger and bigger hereafter.
“...There is an all round improvement on the NPA (non-performing asset) front. We have now complete control on this demon of NPA. Gross NPA is now below 10 per cent at 9.95 per cent,” Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, told the media in the earnings call. 
Net interest income (difference between interest earned and interest expended) was up 12.48 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) at ₹20,906 crore (₹18,586 crore).
However, non-interest income was down 41 per cent y-o-y to ₹9,375 crore (₹16,017 crore) due to a sharp 84.50 per cent y-o-y decline in profit on sale of investments to ₹1,328 crore and 27 per cent y-o-y drop in forex income to ₹493 crore.
Kumar emphasised that his bank’s results should be analysed taking into account the fact that “even this time we had to provide MTM (mark-to-market provision) of ₹1,749 crore and the gratuity provision of ₹900 crore, which we are making every quarter (this was the third quarter — two quarters this year and one quarter last year).”
He added that the bank has to make gratuity provision for one more quarter and then this provision will be complete. 
NPAs declined ₹6,976 crore (reduction in NPAs was higher than slippages) during the quarter against ₹10,587 crore decline in the preceding quarter and an increase of ₹24,286 crore in the fourth quarter of FY18.
As at September-end 2018, GNPAs declined to 9.95 per cent of gross advances against 10.69 per cent in the preceding quarter. Gross NPAs declined by ₹6,976 crore during the quarter to ₹2,05,864 crore as on September-end 2018.
Loan loss provisions declined 39 per cent y-o-y to ₹10,185 crore (₹16,715 crore). Investment depreciation provisions shot up to ₹1,749 crore (₹37 crore).
Domestic advances were up 11.11 per cent y-o-y to ₹17,78,321 crore on the back of growth in corporate (up 14.30 per cent) and retail (8.91 per cent) advances. Foreign advances declined a shade (down 0.34 per cent) at ₹2,90,913 crore.
The bank, in a statement, attributed its net profit to the strategy on controlling credit cost (down to 2.27 per cent from 3.62 per cent), containing overhead expenses (to ₹6,680 crore from ₹6,900 crore) and focus on credit quality.
Higher credit growth and lower slippages lead to improvement in net interest margin to 2.73 per cent from 2.43 per cent in the year-ago period.
Deposits of the whole bank grew 7.02 per cent y-o-y to ₹28,07,420 crore as on September 18.
On exposure to the debt-laden IL&FS, Kumar said his Bank had an exposure of ₹4,000 crore to 13-14 special purpose vehicles of the group. The exposure to the holding company (IL&FS) was ₹250 crore. This exposure is not a cause for concern and the bank had made a provision of ₹56 crore to one of the accounts, he added.
As at September-end 2018, the bank’s exposure to the non-banking finance company sector was ₹1,50,010 crore (₹1,60,653 crore as at June-end 2018) and it is committed to supporting the sector. By March-end 2019, it plans to buy loan portfolio from NBFCs amounting to ₹45,000 crore.
SBI shares closed at ₹295.30 apiece, up 3.45 per cent over the previous close on BSE."
211,2018-11-05,State Bank,"SBI’s bad loans remain high with no significant reduction in watchlist 
 


 At first glance, SBI reporting profits in the latest September quarter against a substantial loss in the June quarter, a small reduction in gross non-performing assets (GNPA), and lower provisioning appear to have enthused the markets. But as they say, the devil is in the detail. Digging deeper into SBI’s numbers suggests a not-so-comforting picture for the largest lender.
Elevated fresh slippages, no substantial reduction in the bank’s watchlist (stressed assets pool), and fall in recoveries (from the June quarter) indicate that the bank is still not out of the woods. Markets could well give a thumbs down to SBI’s September quarter performance on Tuesday.
After reporting a loss of ₹4,876 crore in the June quarter, SBI managed to move into the black, reporting a profit of about ₹945 crore. But had it not been for the one-off exceptional gain of ₹1,560 crore, earnings of SBI would have remained in the red in the September quarter as well. 
SBI’s asset quality woes that got accentuated with the merger of its associate banks are yet to ease up. 
Just as any other bank, SBI, too, had reported huge slippages during FY18 when the RBI’s February circular on stressed assets further accelerated the NPA recognition exercise. But even the June quarter performance for the bank remained dismal as it saw accretion of ₹14,300 crore (fresh slippages, plus increase in outstanding NPAs) to its bad loan book.
In the latest September quarter, SBI has added ₹10,888 crore to its bad loans, a figure that is hardly comforting for a bank that sits on a bad loan book of over ₹2 lakh crore.
Also, SBI witnessed a much lower recovery and upgradation of ₹4,300 crore in the September quarter from around ₹14,800 crore in the June quarter. 
Despite the steep slippages, SBI still has around ₹20,359 crore accounts under its watchlist – this includes all corporate SMA2 (where payments are overdue by 61-90 days) and stressed SMA1 accounts (overdue by 31-60 days). 
Such a large stressed assets pool remains a worry, and leaves open the possibility of still large slippages in the coming quarters.
The RBI’s February diktat that requires banks to report even one-day defaults and draw up resolution plans within 180 days, has also led to a lot of uncertainty for banks that are saddled with large stressed power assets. Of SBI’s watchlist as of September 2018, about ₹9,900 crore pertains to the power sector.
The fact that a chunk of the slippages in the September quarter have come from outside the corporate sector is also worrisome. 
About ₹3,189 crore of slippages were from the corporate sector in the September quarter. The balance – around ₹7,500 crore (up from ₹6,200 crore in the June quarter) – appears to have come from other segments such as agri, SME and retail. 
Non-corporate slippages in the latest September quarter appear to be the highest (barring the post-merger impact in June quarter last year) in the last two years.
Hence, still elevated additions to bad loans and a large watchlist indicate that recovery in earnings for SBI is likely to be a long-drawn exercise with little respite in the current fiscal.
While SBI’s loan growth has picked up to 11 per cent in the September quarter (domestic advances) from 7 per cent in the June quarter, it has not resulted in the expected growth in net interest income (possibly due to slippages). 
SBI’s 12 per cent growth in net interest income in the September quarter is still a lukewarm performance for a bank of its size and reach."

   -  PAUL NORONHA


 To incentivise points of presence (PoPs) such as banks and broking firms to enrol more people under the National Pension System (NPS), the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) should allow higher initial subscriber registration charge, according to a top official of a pension fund management firm.
Though this charge was raised to ₹200 in October 2017 from ₹125 earlier, the official said that it needs to be suitably hiked further so that PoPs feel incentivised enough to actively distribute NPS.
“If we evaluate the charge in terms of banks which have the maximum reach, probably it does not cover the employee cost for them...So, this is something which has to be fixed.
“...It is a laudable objective to reduce the costs but a balance has to be struck. If it (the charge) is not generating enough interest in the PoPs, which have the widest reach to propagate the scheme, if they don’t feel incentivised enough, NPS penetration will continue to be low,” said Kumar Sharadindu, MD and CEO of SBI Pension Funds.
NPS is a voluntary, defined contribution retirement savings scheme designed to enable subscribers to make optimum decisions regarding their future through systematic savings during their working life. The scheme seeks to inculcate the habit of saving for retirement amongst the nation’s citizens. 
PoPs perform the functions relating to registration of subscribers, undertaking know your customer (KYC) verification, receiving contributions and instructions from subscribers and transmission of the same in the NPS architecture. As on October 30, there are 134 entities, which have registered themselves as POPs for NPS. These include banks, broking firms, housing finance companies, and AMCs.
“While the fee for PoPs has been increased, it is not attractive enough. Otherwise, they would have been gung-ho, particularly in the existing challenging times which the banking industry, especially public sector banks, is going through. Any source of income would be highly welcome.
“As far as SBI is concerned, it does open the largest number of (NPS) accounts every year...But there are certain public sector banks which are not doing anything on this front. I would suppose, they don’t see much incentive to do this (open NPS accounts) over some other things (such as recovery, as balance sheet strength comes from this activity),” said Sharadindu. 
Out of the total subscriber base of 2.24 crore under the NPS as at July-end 2018, the ‘all citizen’ category, comprising individuals (other than those under the NPS Lite-Swavalamban and Atal Pension Yojana categories), accounted for only 7.22 lakh subscribers. In terms of numbers, the largest NPS subscriber category is the Atal Pension Yojana (1.07 crore). There were 59.21 lakh subscribers under the government category and 7.25 lakh subscribers under the corporate category.
As per PFRDA data, the total contribution under the NPS grew to ₹2,03,057 crore as of July-end 2018 against ₹1,98,530 crore as of June-end 2018. Government sector subscribers accounted for about 84 per cent of this contribution."

 An internal study on claims data by SBI General Insurance brought forth some startling statistics. 
Diabetes claims have surged over the last two years. The insurance company’s claims analysis revealed that Indians in the age group of 18-35 years are the most vulnerable to the potentially fatal disease.
On a pan-India level, the company witnessed a rise in the number of claims reported each year, with Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat having the highest paid claims for diabetes-related ailments.
Touted to be the world’s seventh-largest killer by 2030, diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions. According to the World Health Organization, about 8.7 per cent of people between the ages of 20-70 are diabetic in India. 
Conducting an internal study on their claims data, SBI General Insurance found that diabetes-related claims have jumped to 26 per cent in 2017-18, with the maximum claims coming in from metros, at 63 per cent. Some 37 per cent claims have come in from non-metros. The study revealed 59 per cent claims were from males, and 41 per cent from females. This year, the company received maximum number of claims from Maharashtra at 22 per cent, followed by Tamil Nadu at 13 per cent, and Gujarat at 10.36 per cent.
The company said 6 per cent of all claims settled by SBI General are for diabetes, which amounts to over ₹11 crore in 2017-18. Diabetes-related claims have risen in the 18-35 age group from 7.22 per cent to 9.88 per cent over three years.
SBI General Insurance’s analysis and comparison of its internal claims data between FY2016 and FY2018 has shown a staggering 54 per cent rise in the total number of claims on year-on-year basis. Within diabetes claims, a whopping 73 per cent increase was seen in the number of claims, between the age group of 18-35 years. Similarly, the age group of 35-45 saw an increase of 32 per cent claims, whereas the 45-55 age group saw a rise of 38 per cent.
Sukhesh Bhave, Head-Accident and Health Claims, SBI General Insurance, said:“The excess blood sugar in diabetes can severely damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and other body parts, and double the risk of heart attack and stroke,” he said."

The European Investment Bank and State Bank of India have formally agreed to finance the renewable energy sector by providing new support for wind energy projects across India. This is being done by expanding an ongoing financing initiative to support onshore wind projects.
A statement from the European Investment Bank said, “Under the agreement, promoters of onshore wind projects will be able to benefit from long-term low cost financing under a dedicated €600-million renewable energy financing programme already supporting large scale solar investment across India.”
“Preliminary discussions with promoters in a number of Indian states have already led to the identification of schemes that could benefit from the expanded EIB-SBI financing,” the statement added.

 The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Thursday approved the sale of 4 per cent stake in SBI General Insurance for ₹482 crore to two alternative investment funds (AIFs).
 The executive committee of SBI at its meeting held Thursday approved the sale of 86.2 lakh shares of ₹10 each, equalling to 4 per cent stake in its subsidiary SBI General Insurance Company Ltd (SBI GI), for ₹482 crore (around $66 million), SBI said in a release.
Axis New Opportunities AIF-I and PI Opportunities Fund-I, an AIF of Premji Invest, will purchase 1.65 per cent and 2.35 per cent stake, respectively, from SBI.
The proposed transaction values SBI GI at over ₹12,000 crore. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals, said SBI.
 After completion of the transaction, SBI will hold 70 per cent stake in SBI GI, while its joint venture partner IAG International Pty Ltd will continue to hold 26 per cent.
 “Insurance segment is still young and nascent in India, it is an under-penetrated market, we foresee a significant scope of growth for SBI GI to achieve size, scale and profitability,” said SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar.
 This transaction values SBI GI at around ₹12,000 crore, reflecting significant value creation within 7 years of business operations, Dinesh Khara, managing director, Global Banking and Subsidiaries, said.
 SBI General Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer Pushan Mahapatra said the company is the fastest-growing general insurer in the private sector.
 “The company is in just 7th year into operations and has already achieved sizeable scale, making it the seventh-largest private general insurance player as at the end of June 2018,” Mahapatra said.

SBI said the interested banks/asset reconstruction companies (ARCs)/non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) or financial institutions (FIs) can conduct due diligence of these assets with immediate effect, after submitting expression of interest and executing a non-disclosure agreement with the bank.
Once the deal is finalised, the assignment deed and other legal formalities will be completed in the shortest possible time as mutually agreed upon, SBI added.

The Kerala High Court has directed State Bank of India to maintain status quo on its decision to outsource currency administration and cash management to third-party service providers in the Kerala circle.
The court direction follows a writ petition challenging the bank management’s move to outsource core functions, including that of currency chest administration.
The petitioners, State Bank Staff Union, Kerala Circle, submitted that the management and Circle Development Officer, Local Head Office, Thiruvananthapuram, have decided to outsource the functions of the currency chest management and cash administration to a third party, which is in absolute violation of the principles enumerated in the SBI Act, 1955. If the currency chest, and its management, are outsourced, the confidentiality, credibility and security intended by virtue of the legislation would undoubtedly be defeated, it was pointed out.
According to M Sasindran, counsel for the petitioner, the process of currency administration is one of the integrated businesses of the bank and a core function. It involves cash sorting, management of solid currency, collection of money from branches, and management of the currency chest. In SBI, currency management is done in an organised manner by employees who are recruited in strict adherence to legislative mandates.
Now, through the process of outsourcing, the management is trying to induct people not through direct recruitment, but through agencies, which is not supposed to follow the principles enumerated in the recruitment policy adopted by SBI.
 RBI guidelines state that the bank that chooses to outsource financial services should not outsource core management functions. The HR handbook strictly prohibits outsourcing of the currency administration cell due to the fact that it would affect internal control, business conduct, and reputation of the bank, he said."

The country’s largest lender, State Bank of India, is betting big on its retail growth story. The bank’s retail advances, which have grown nearly 14 per cent so far during this fiscal, is likely to grow close to 16-17 per cent in FY20. 
According to PK Gupta, MD, Retail and Digital Banking, the higher growth would be supported by the bank’s digital banking initiatives. The bank is also looking to buy portfolio of assets from NBFCs in housing, MSME and microfinance space, which will help boost its loan book. SBI has already bought close to ₹5,000 crore of portfolio from NBFCs, and has a pipeline of portfolio worth close to ₹15,000 crore, which is currently being ‘evaluated’.
“Retail story continues to be strong. We expect the year 2019-20 to be an even better year. We are looking to ramp up our digital offering and delivering more number of retail loans on this platform,” Gupta told BusinessLine.
SBI’s retail loan book, which includes personal, agriculture and MSME loans, currently accounts for nearly 59 per cent of its total advances, and is likely to grow to 60-61 per cent by the end of this fiscal. 
As on September 2018, the bank’s total advances stood at close to ₹17.78 lakh crore. Of this, retail personal loan stood at ₹5.77 lakh crore, accounting for nearly 32 per cent of the total advances. Agriculture and SME account for 11 per cent and 15 per cent of total advances, respectively. Interestingly, SBI was heavy on corporate loans, with nearly 70 per cent of its total advances coming from such loans till about three years back, said market sources. However, the share of corporate loans has shrunk, and is now down to close to 40 per cent.
“There are a few factors helping growth of retail. First, the bank’s internal data analytics capabilities have increased substantially, and we can use the data to offer loans. Second, the credit bureau score helps to identify credit-worthy customers. Even KYC, and other background checks, are much more easily done than in the past,” he said.
Housing, including affordable housing under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and personal loans, will be the key growth drivers for the retail sector, he added. 
 According to Gupta, SBI has been witnessing a “huge migration” of customers from branch banking to other channels.
The share of alternative channels, including internet, mobile, ATMs, POS and its app Yono in conducting transactions, has increased to over 83 per cent in September 2018, when compared to 78 per cent in the same period last year. 
SBI has roped in Asian Games gold medalist Swapna Barman as brand ambassador for its digital app Yono. The app, which claims to take care of the banking, investment and shopping needs of its customers, has close to 4.5 million registered users, and has seen 13 million downloads since its launch about a year ago. 
The bank, which offers personalised banking and investment services to its HNI (high networth individual) customers under ‘SBI Wealth’ service, is planning to cover one lakh customers in this segment in the next six months. It currently has 99 Wealth Hubs spread across 27 cities, and has enrolled 39,000 clients with assets under management of ₹22,000 crore. 
“The target is to reach 50 cities by next fiscal and cover 100,000 clients and grow AUM to ₹50,000 crore,” he said."
203,2018-12-05,State Bank,"SBI will cease to be EPFO fund manager from March-end: Labour minister 
 The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) will cease to be a fund manager of retirement fund body EPFO by March-end, as a bank cannot function as an asset management company under the RBI norms.
“We have been told that SBI cannot work (as fund manager of the EPFO). We have not engaged (its arm) SBI Mutual Fund (as fund manager) because it was not there (as an applicant at the time of bidding) earlier,” Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar said.
 He was addressing reporters after a meeting of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation’s (EPFO) apex decision-making body Central Board of Trustees (CBT), chaired by him.
 The minister also said: “We have given them (all five fund managers) time till March. We will discuss and take a call as to whom we can engage as a fund manager. We had engaged SBI. But its job is banking and not this job (fund managing). SBI Mutual (Fund) was not enrolled with us as a fund manager. After March, if they (SBI’s fund managing arm) come for this then we can engage them.”
Currently, SBI, ICICI Securities Primary Dealership, Reliance Capital, HSBC AMC and UTI AMC are fund managers of the EPFO.
 The EPFO has separately engaged SBI Capital and UTI Mutual Funds as exchange-traded fund (ETF) managers. The SBI Capital manages 75 per cent of ETF investment of the EPFO, while the UTI Mutual Funds takes care of the remaining 25 per cent.
During the meeting, another proposal to increase the proportion of UTI Mutual Funds as ETF manufacturer came up for discussion which was referred to the EPFO’s finance, audit and investment committee (FAIC). The body has invested about Rs 55,000 crore in ETFs so far, a senior official said.
 On the issue of giving higher pension to employees contributing more towards Employees Pension Scheme-95 (EPS-95), the minister said: “This matter is sub-judice with the Supreme Court. After the decision of the apex court, we will take a decision. We have sought an advice of an actuary on this issue. We will take a decision factoring in that advice. There were a large number of people who came here today on this issue. But the decision would be taken by the Government of India.” 
Asked about doubling the minimum monthly pension to Rs 2,000, he said: “There was no such proposal listed on the agenda for meeting today. The government has to make arrangement (provide funds) for managing existing minimum monthly pension of Rs 1,000. This is subject to government approval.
“We told (the Finance Ministry) what would be the financial implication for keeping minimum monthly pension at Rs 1,000, Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 levels. This will be decided by them (the Finance Ministry).” 
The CBT meeting on Tuesday held by newly-reconstituted Board, approved the constitution of the FAIC, Pension & EDLI (insurance scheme) Implementation Committee and Exempted Establishments Committee (for PF trusts).
 The CBT ratified the proposal of appointment of CRISIL Ltd as Consultant to assist the EPFO in selection and review of portfolio managers.
 The Board also mandated FAIC to select new fund manager for managing the corpus of the EPFO.
 It extended the tenure of the current portfolio managers up to March 31, 2019 or till appointment of new portfolio managers, whichever is earlier. The Board also extended the tenure of CRISIL Ltd as consultant up to March 31, 2019 or till appointment of new portfolio managers, whichever is earlier."

 The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE), through its Electronic Bidding Platform, NSE-EBP, facilitated a ₹2,000-crore debt fund-raising programme for the State Bank of India. This debt programme will help meet SBI’s tier-1 capital requirement for the current financial year.
Under the programme, SBI has raised and retained ₹4,021 crore via perpetual bonds issue.
The capital raise was of the nature of non-convertible, taxable, redeemable, subordinated bonds, which are Basel III-compliant. The bonds are unsecured debt instruments issued in the form of debentures. The issue size was ₹2,000 crore, with greenshoe option of ₹3,000 crore to retain over-subscription. The issue was oversubscribed over five times of the issue size and is the largest Basel III-compliant Tier I perpetual bonds single tranche successful issue in current financial year with accepted subscription of more than ₹4,000 crore on the EBP.
The perpetual bonds are priced at par with face value of ₹10 lakh per bond with an exercisable call option after five years.

 SWIFT India on Monday said it has appointed former SBI chief Arundhati Bhattacharya as the new Chairman of its board.
SWIFT India is a joint venture of top Indian public and private sector banks and SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication).
Bhattacharya will succeed former banker M. V. Nair, who is stepping down after completing five years with the company, SWIFT India said in a statement.
The company was created to deliver high-quality domestic financial messaging services to the Indian financial community. Bhattacharya said the venture has the potential to contribute significantly to the financial community in many domains. 
Nair said: “It has been a fulfilling journey with SWIFT India, which is a unique venture on many counts. I would like to thank everyone associated in building this venture from scratch.” 
SWIFT India CEO Kiran Shetty hoped to work closely with the former SBI head."
198,2018-12-14,State Bank,"SBI asks EY to carry out forensic audit of Jet Air accounts from 2014-18


Jet Airways has been struggling to keep afloat following three consecutive quarterly losses of over Rs 1,000 crore each.




Jet Airways has been struggling to keep afloat following three consecutive quarterly losses of over Rs 1,000 crore each.


Debt-laden Jet Airways seem to be lurching from one crisis to another.
In the latest turbulence, State Bank of India has asked EY to carry out a forensic audit of the airline’s financials for the fiscal years 2014 to 2018. SBI is the lead banker to the airline’s loans of over ₹8,000 crore.
According to sources close to the development, the probe was initiated after a complaint was made to the bank in August this year. “Since the allegations are financial in nature, EY has been appointed to audit it and a copy of the report will be sent to the complainant,” the source said.
While SBI and EY declined to comment, the spokesperson for Jet Airways was not available.
Jet Airways has a loan account with SBI whose exposure to the airline is said to be close to ₹2,000 crore. Jet had reported a net loss of ₹1,261 crore for the second quarter of FY19. 
According to sources, a fortnight ago, the cash-strapped airline had requested a $350-million soft loan from its investment partner Etihad Airways, which owns a 24 per cent stake in the full-service Indian carrier.
It was also reported that Jet’s founder Naresh Goyal had approached Etihad for increasing its stake to 49 per cent.
Even as the talks were going on, Abu Dhabi-based businessman and the Managing Director of Lulu Group International, Yusuff Ali MA, who was also said to have evinced an interest in the troubled airline, walked away from a likely deal.
 
In November, there were reports that Tata Sons was likely to pick up a stake in Jet Airways. The Tatas already own stakes in full-service carrier Vistara (51 per cent) and budget player AirAsia India (49 per cent).
However, after a board meeting, the company clarified that the discussions with Jet Airways were “preliminary” and that “no proposal” had been made."
197,2018-12-16,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (₹289.1)
SBI opened the week on a negative note with a wide gap-down of ₹14 at ₹261.1. The stop-loss on the long positions recommended was hit. However, the stock managed to claw-back from the low of ₹261.1, recovering all the loss and closed on a positive note. The stock was up 5 per cent for the week. A crucial near-term resistance is at ₹294. Whether SBI breaks above this hurdle or not will determine the direction of the next move. Inability to breach ₹294 can pull the stock lower to ₹278 or ₹274 in the near term. A further break below ₹274 will then target ₹269. On the other hand, if SBI breaks above ₹294 decisively, it can gain strength. Such a break can take the stock initially higher to ₹310 and ₹312. A strong break above ₹312 will then pave way for the next target of ₹322 thereafter. Short-term traders can go long on a break above ₹294. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹282 for the target of ₹318. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹307.










ITC (₹275.6)
ITC broke below the key support level of ₹271 in the initial part of the week. However, negative sentiment was short-lived as ITC reversed sharply higher, recovering all the loss from the low of ₹268.2. Though the daily candles on the chart give mixed signals, the weekly candles are relatively positive. Support is in the ₹272-271 region. As long as the stock remains above this support zone, there is a strong likelihood of it breaking above the near-term resistance level of ₹279. Such a break can take ITC initially higher to ₹285 or ₹287. A further break above ₹287 will increase the possibility of the stock extending its up-move towards the 21-week moving average resistance level of ₹293. The bullish outlook will get negated if ITC breaks and closes decisively below ₹271. The stock can, thus, fall initially to ₹267. A bounce from ₹267 can take the stock higher to ₹271 and ₹272 again. But a strong break below ₹267 will increase the downside pressure. This will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹262 thereafter.










Infosys (₹705.6)
Infosys is retaining its strength. The stock was up for the third consecutive week. It surged 3.6 per cent, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹687 and closed on a strong note. The outlook is bullish. Immediate support is at ₹698 and the next key support is at ₹688. Also, there is an inverted head and shoulder pattern visible on the daily chart. This is a bullish reversal pattern. The neckline support of this pattern is at ₹684. Intermediate dips in the near term are likely to find fresh buyers coming into the market. An up-move to ₹721 is likely in the near term. Inability to breach ₹721 can trigger an intermediate pull-back move to ₹700. But an eventual break above ₹721 will boost the momentum. This will increase the likelihood of the stock revisiting ₹740 and ₹750 levels. Traders can go long at current levels and also accumulate on dips at the levels of ₹701 and ₹693. Keep the stop-loss at ₹675 for the target of ₹760. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹715 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹730.










RIL (₹1,111.7)
RIL fell for the second consecutive week. The stock was down about 2 per cent last week. However, the sharp bounce from the week’s low of ₹1,055 gives a breather for the stock. The 200-day as well as a trend-line, both poised around ₹1,055, has provided strong support for RIL. The near-term outlook is mixed. Resistance is at ₹1,128. If RIL manages to sustain above ₹1,100 and decisively break above ₹1,128, the near-term outlook will turn positive. An up-move to ₹1,160 is possible. A further break above ₹1,160 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹1,185. On the other hand, if RIL declines below ₹1,100, it can fall to ₹1,055 again. A further break below ₹1,055 will increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹1,030 or even ₹1,010 thereafter. Broadly, RIL has been range-bound between ₹1,050 and ₹1,200 since October. A decisive breakout on either side of ₹1,050 or ₹1,200 will determine the direction of the next move. Traders can stay out of this stock until a clear trend emerges.










Tata Steel (₹513.4)
Tata Steel snapped its three-week fall. The stock reversed higher from the low of ₹486.9, recovering all the loss and closed 1.1 per cent higher for the week. Though the stock has bounced back, the price action seems to be lacking strength. This leaves the bias negative and keeps the broader downtrend intact. Cluster of resistance is poised in the ₹530-540 region, which can cap the upside in the near term. If Tata Steel manages to breach ₹540, an upmove to ₹565 and ₹570 is possible. But while below ₹540, a fall again to ₹485 and ₹480 cannot be ruled out. A bounce from around ₹480 again can keep the stock range-bound between ₹480 and ₹540. But a strong break below ₹480 can drag Tata Steel lower to ₹460. The level of ₹460 is a crucial long-term trend support, which may have the potential to halt the downtrend that has been in place since the beginning of this year. As such, the price action around ₹460 will need a close watch to get a cue on the next move."
196,2018-12-18,State Bank,"Fresh accretion of NPAs has come down: SBI 


npa




npa


 The State Bank of India (SBI) has been pursuing resolution of Non Performing Assets (NPA) and they should decline in the future, with fresh accretion coming down, a senior bank official said on Tuesday.
 “As far as the NPAs are concerned, most of the large accounts which were not performing had already been regularised as NPA. So the bank has been acting on getting the resolutions done. So, lot of those large cases are already under NCLT,” SBI Managing Director (Retail & Digital Banking), Parveen Kumar Gupta told reporters here.
 The resolutions have already been done in a few cases, while they were in an advanced stage in a few others, he said. He hoped that those resolutions would go through in the next couple of months. “The fresh accretion to NPAs has already come down. So, we hope that going forward on the NPA front, we should see a decline in the numbers. We don’t see NPA numbers actually going up in the future,” he said.
 Gupta, who was speaking on the sidelines of celebration of 150th anniversary of SBI Hyderabad main branch, was asked about the steps the bank planned to take to ensure that it was able to tackle the issue of high NPAs. “In a few states, we have seen increase in the NPAs in the agri segment. But, we have not seen this across the country. Only in a few states, we have seen some increase,” he said."
195,2018-12-23,State Bank,"`No induction of outsiders to perform core SBI functions' 


The High Court of Kerala has disposed of a writ petition by the State Banks Staff Union (SBSU) after recording a submission that 'no personnel will be inducted for carrying out any essential function of State Bank of India (SBI).' 
Justice Anu Sivaraman had heard the petition filed by SBSU, challenging the SBI management’s move to outsource core functions. 
Earlier on December 3, the court had directed SBI to maintain status quo on its decision to outsource currency administration and cash management to third-party service providers in the Kerala Circle.
'ONE OF CORE FUNCTIONS'
The SBSU had argued that the State Bank of India Act,1955, provides that cash management is one of the core functions of the bank. 
Such a function cannot be permitted to be outsourced in terms of not just the bank's own policies but also those of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
The petitioners alleged that the bank is is attempting to outsource core functions of cash management to private agencies and allowing their employees to function within its premises. 
Also on the outsourcing list are the currency administration cell; cash administration in branches and offices; and cash administration and management and administration of the currency chest. 
They also argued that outsourcing of the currency administration cell violated the objective of State Bank of India Act 1955 and guidelines framed by the RBI. 
The bank should not be allowed to induct manpower to manage banking functions in the branches, head office, and other offices other than through established recruitment rules.
Currency administration is being executed by permanent employees of the bank. Outsourcing its amounts to 'denial of future employment' and violated Article 16 of the Constitution', they said. 
Meanwhile, in its counter affidavit, the SBI stated that the fully automatic note verification and processing machine is intended to segregate notes into ATM fit notes, reusable notes, soiled and unusable notes, and fake notes. 
'89 CENTRES IN ALL' 
The machine is being installed in 89 identified centres of the bank and that the out of 89, the machines have been successfully installed in 77 centres, including three centres in Kerala. 
In the remaining centres also, what is being done is only the installation of the machines for sorting the cash. 
There is no threat of any kind to the scope of employment or promotional opportunities of SBI employees from the mechanical sorting and bundling of notes. 
Neither the interest of the employees nor that of the customers is in any way compromised through implementation of the mechanical segregation and bundling of notes. 
On the contrary, the bank will be able to utilise the manpower for enhancing its business potentials in a far superior way.
There is no intention to give direct control of currency chests to any third party; what is being outsourced is only the currency management using the automatic currency sorting machines. 
Provisions of settlements entered into between the bank and the SBSU as well as regulatory guidelines issued by the RBI will be scrupulously followed in the matter. 
M Sasindran and S Shyam Kumar represented the petitioners while George Thomas Mevada (Senior) and KR Rajkumar did the honours for the respondents."

 State Bank of India (SBI) Managing Director P K Gupta said that the charges for various services offered by the bank are among the lowest in the industry.
Various services offered by the bank, including ATM transaction and cash deposits, come at a cost, but the charges have been kept low in the larger interest of customers, Gupta told PTI.
Asked about rationale for levying charges for non-maintenance of monthly average balance (MAB), he said the bank has invested heavily in technological upgradation of systems for providing safe and secure banking facilities at any place in the country. Further, ATMs and cash points have been created across the country, thereby making huge investment for benefit and convenience of customers.
 “With substantial investment in infrastructure and technology, it becomes imperative for the bank to recover at least a part of the cost. Considering the improvement in the quality of facilities and services extended to customers, the requirement of MAB in savings bank accounts was re-introduced from April 2017,” he added.
The managing director looking after retail and digital banking also pointed out that these charges were reduced twice - in October last year and subsequently in April this year.
“Our charges are on the lower side when compared with the other private sector banks,” Gupta said.
 Besides, he said 60 per cent of the total savings account holders, including no-frill accounts, student and minor are exempt from requirement of MAB.
Customers are given various free services like 5 free ATM transaction and 2 cash withdrawal at branches, he noted.
To promote digital transaction, the bank has now made available to the customers several digital options to make payments seamlessly instead of using the ATMs. 
“Our request to our customers is to use the digital channels as much as possible, since the ATM operations are becoming costlier day by day,” he said.
To promote digital transactions, he said, the bank in fact offers reward points to the customers."

First, loans went kaput and borrowers left the country after defaulting on payments or committing frauds; then, high-profile bankers were forced to leave and even the top central banker quit in the end. 2018 was indeed a ‘year of exits’ for the banking sector.
In the meantime, the sector continued to sit on a mountain of non-performing assets (NPAs) even as efforts continued in courts and tribunals and other forums for the recovery of stressed assets, which was further confounded by defaulting promoters of corporates coming back to reclaim their assets when they were put on sale by aggrieved lenders.
The eventful year began with the lid being taken off from the country’s biggest-ever banking fraud. Billionaire diamantaire Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi, in connivance with certain bank officials, allegedly cheated state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) of about ₹14,000 crore through issuance of fraudulent letters of undertaking.
A Mumbai branch of PNB had fraudulently issued LoUs for the group of companies belonging to Modi since March 2011, and there were hundreds of such LoUs.
The magnitude of the scam shook the entire banking system and PNB is still trying to overcome the fallout.
As intricacies of the Nirav Modi scam were still unfolding, a whistle-blower in March raised an issue of impropriety against Chanda Kochhar, the then managing director of the country’s largest private sector lender ICICI Bank, which, for long, had been a showcase institution where nothing could go wrong.
Kochhar, 56, who rose through the ranks to occupy the corner office of the prestigious institution, was mired in allegations of conflict of interest, lack of disclosures, and quid pro quo while extending loans to the now-bankrupt Videocon Industries.

Subsequently, another complaint was filed against her and she had to eventually say goodbye to the bank that she had joined as a management trainee in 1984.
As regulatory and internal probes continued, the bank and Kochhar denied any wrongdoing.
Another high-profile banker Shikha Sharma was denied extension by the RBI as managing director of Axis Bank, the third-largest private sector lender. The bank’s board had proposed another three-year term for her till May 2021, but she was allowed to serve only till December 31, 2018.

Another exit story continues to play out at YES Bank, where Rana Kapoor’s tenure as CEO has been curtailed by the Reserve Bank of India, and he has been allowed to occupy the position only till January 31. The lender also saw Ashok Chawla quitting as its chairman last month.
However, the biggest of the exits took place at the RBI with Governor Urjit Patel announcing his sudden resignation with immediate effect on December 10 citing “personal reasons”. The resignation, however, followed a run-in with the government over several issues, including autonomy of the central bank. The very next day, the government appointed former bureaucrat Shaktikanta Das as the new RBI chief.
In case of both Axis Bank and YES Bank, the RBI had flagged problems with their assets. Axis Bank’s NPAs jumped over five-fold in two years till March 2017, while net profit halved in the same period. It saw its gross bad loans ratio rise to 5.04 per cent by March 2017, from 0.96 per cent in March 2009, when Sharma had taken charge.
Several lenders, including YES Bank, were asked by the RBI to disclose ‘divergences’ in their bad loan reporting. The central bank judged gross NPAs at ₹8,373.8 crore at YES Bank for 2016-17, against the declared gross NPAs of ₹2,018 crore.
As a promoter, Kapoor and his family own 10.66 per cent stake in the bank, which is now actively searching for his replacement as CEO.
In the public sector banking space, the fight continued against NPAs and the situation remains far from normal.
Gross NPAs peaked in March and have shown some moderation of nearly ₹23,860 crore in the first half of the current financial year (April-September 2018) to ₹8,71,741 crore. It stood at ₹8,95,601 crore as on March 2018.
Losses at public sector banks widened further to ₹4,532 crore in the quarter ended October 2018, from ₹4,285 crore in the same quarter a year ago, indicating pressure from NPAs on their bottomlines. Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar, however, pointed out that the record recovery of ₹67,026 crore in the first half of the current financial year, was more than double the amount recovered in the first half of the last fiscal and nearly the same as the ₹67,107 crore recovered during the whole of the preceding financial year.
He asserted that a significant recovery is expected, going forward, as a number of high-value accounts are at advanced stages of the resolution process in the National Company Law Tribunal.
During the year, the government also approved the stake-sale of IDBI Bank to LIC. As part of the consolidation process, the government also announced the merger of Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank to create a global-sized lender, which will be “stronger and sustainable”. With a combined business of ₹14.8 lakh crore, it will be the country’s third-largest bank after state-run SBI and private lender ICICI Bank."

To become a better bank, State Bank of India (SBI) is planning to conduct an employee engagement survey, whereby it expects about 2.17 lakh officers and clerical staff to speak up and say what is on their mind. The aim of the exercise is to get a better understanding of employee morale, satisfaction, and overall employee engagement.
The employee engagement survey, 'Abhivyakti' (expression), comes 21 months after the merger of the five associate banks -- State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Hyderabad; and Bharatiya Mahila Bank -- with SBI, India's largest Bank. 
The survey has twin goals -- “Be The Bank Of Choice For a Transforming India” and ""achieve greater heights globally."" It is being launched at a time when private sector banks and non-banking finance companies are nibbling away at public sector banks' market share and increased use of technology in banking may require reorientation of the workforce. 
Post-merger, SBI's total workforce jumped to 2,64,041 as at March-end 2018 against 2,09,567 as at March-end 2017. As at March-end 2018, the officer and clerical staff strength stood at 1,07,077 and 1,10,348, respectively. The number of employees in the 'subordinate staff & others' category stood at 46,616.
""In our constant endeavour to move to the next phase of the bank's growth...it is our people who will be the differentiators...Your opinions are important for making State Bank of India a better bank and this survey is your opportunity to express those opinions,"" said Rajnish Kumar, Chairman of India's largest bank, in a communication to employees.

Kumar wants employees to be clear on the bank’s strategy and direction. He observed that the bank will succeed if employees are committed and willing to contribute their maximum effort. 
""The greater our engagement, the higher the performance of the bank and the individual...I sincerely urge you all to participate in this survey and provide your sincere responses, which will be treated with utmost confidentiality. Please note that we value your opinion and your response will be kept confidential,"" said Kumar.
The survey results would serve three purposes: to get employees perception and feedback on different HR policies, work culture, working atmosphere, support system and managerial control, leadership quality, training & development; to understand the effectiveness of various employee reward and recognition programmes/ incentive schemes and other employee welfare measures; and to understand the effectiveness of manpower planning and transfer processes, employee grievance redressal mechanism.
The survey will be open to all clerical staff and officers. The SBI chief is hoping to get 100 per cent participation in the survey, in order to ensure that the desired benefit is derived. 
Kumar exhorted employees: ""This is your bank and we want to hear from each one of you! You will receive further information and detailing on the process, guidelines and the timelines of the survey shortly. Your voice matters to us! Go ahead and voice your opinion!""

SBI (₹294.4) 
SBI is managing to sustain higher. The stock dipped to an intraweek low of ₹287.2, but reversed immediately higher from there. The resistance at ₹301 is likely to be tested in the near term. Inability to breach ₹301 can pull SBI lower to ₹290 and ₹287 again. But the price action on the chart leaves the bias bullish for the stock to break above ₹301 and rally towards ₹310 and ₹312. A further break above ₹312 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹320 and ₹322. The region around ₹322 is a crucial long-term resistance. The price action around this hurdle will need a close watch to get a cue on the next direction of move. Supports are at ₹287 and ₹284.5. The near-term view will turn negative only if SBI declines below ₹284.5. The next target is ₹280. But such a fall looks less probable at the moment. Traders who have taken long positions above ₹294 can hold with a stop-loss at ₹282. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock goes up to ₹307. Book profits at ₹318. 










ITC (₹281.9) 
ITC inched higher for the third consecutive week. The stock was up 2 per cent last week. Immediate resistance is at ₹284 and support at ₹278. The stock is likely to breach ₹284 and test ₹287 in the near term. A break above ₹287 can then target ₹290. The levels of ₹287 and ₹290 are key resistances, and whether ITC breaches these hurdles or not will decide the direction of the next move. A decisive break above ₹290 will boost the momentum and take ITC higher to ₹296 and ₹300 thereafter. Such an up-move will also confirm the end of the downtrend that has been in place since September. On the other hand, if ITC reverses lower from ₹287 or ₹290, it can fall to ₹280 and ₹275 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹275 and ₹290.










Infosys (₹657.6) 
Infosys fell in the initial part of the week but managed to claw-back from the low of ₹637.7 and closed 2 per cent higher. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 200-day moving average support at ₹649 is holding well . Key resistances are at ₹663, ₹666 and ₹671. As long as Infosys trades above ₹649, a test of the above-mentioned hurdles is possible in the near term. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹671 will turn the outlook to positive and take the stock higher to ₹682 and ₹686. A further break above ₹686 will then pave way for the next short-term targets of ₹700 and ₹710. The stock will come under pressure if it breaks decisively below the 200-day moving average. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹630. A break below ₹630 can then drag it to ₹600 and ₹590. Traders who took short positions last week at ₹660 should remain cautious. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹675. Move the stop-loss further lower to ₹655 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹645. Book profits at ₹630. 










RIL (₹1,125.8) 
RIL reversed sharply higher last week after making a low of ₹1,066.5 and closed 2 per cent higher. The upward reversal has happened from the 200-day moving average, which has been providing strong support for the stock since October. The near-term view is positive and RIL can move up to ₹1,180 and ₹1,185. The stock has been range-bound between ₹1,050 and ₹1,185 for more than three months now. Its ability to bounce higher every time it dips to the 200-day moving average keeps the bias positive . The possibility is also high of the stock breaking above ₹1,185. Such a break will take RIL initially higher to ₹1,205 or ₹1,210. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹1,210 will then boost the momentum and pave way for the next target of ₹1,275. Medium-term investors can go long at current levels and accumulate on dips at ₹1,095 and ₹1,070. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹1,025. The outlook will turn negative only if RIL closes decisively below the 200-day moving average support. In such a scenario, the stock can fall to ₹1,000 and ₹990.










Tata Steel (₹513.7) 
After inching higher for two weeks, Tata Steel reversed last week. Trading in the stock was subdued. It was stuck in a narrow range between ₹505 and ₹521 last week. The 21-day moving average at ₹519 is restricting the upside. A strong break and a decisive close above this hurdle is needed to ease the downside pressure. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹533 or even ₹539 over the short term. Inability to breach ₹533 or ₹539 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹520 and ₹518. But a strong break above ₹539 will boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹546 and ₹550. On the other hand, if Tata Steel remains below the 21-day moving average resistance, a fall to ₹505 or ₹500 is possible in the near term. A break below ₹500 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹480. A bounce from ₹480 can keep the stock range-bound between ₹480 and ₹530 for some time. But a decisive break below ₹480 can then drag Tata Steel lower to the crucial support level of ₹460."
189,2019-01-01,State Bank,"‘Move to conduct employee survey at SBI to re-orient and transform the lender’ 
State Bank of India’s move to conduct an employee-engagement survey is a welcome initiative as it will elicit employees’ views on the work situation and work culture, thereby enabling the redrafting of HR policies, transfer processes, and grievance redressal machinery, according to KS Krishna, General Secretary, All India SBI Employees’ Association.
Instead of engaging a foreign management consultancy firm, as was the practice hitherto, the move to conduct the ‘Abhivyakti’ survey is a positive one, as it will help the management collect and collate feedback from the workforce for re-orienting and transforming the bank, said the association’s office-bearer.
Krishna alleged that the morale and work-satisfaction levels of workforce left much to be desired, with the reasons ranging from frequent changes in customer-related policies and procedures (often in contradiction with customer expectations); fresh conditions, fees, fines on customers leading to adverse reactions from them; and work-load, unscientific manpower deployment, round-the-year transfer of employees, which result in loss of continuity of staff in the frontline at branches and loss of familiarity for customers.
The association is of the view that a fair, unbiased, and transparent system of employee-transfer and posting policy, processes and procedures are needed to keep high the morale and motivational levels of employees.
Krishna said that the present money-oriented, incentive-driven rewards and recognition system was doing more harm, adversely impacting team spirit and team work.
“A higher degree of sense of belongingness to the organisation on the part of employees could be created. The management could…enable free lines of communication among the workforce, irrespective of cadre, and ensure a ‘listening and understanding’ culture at all levels.
“That culture can lead to greater involvement of employees in the bank’s developmental roles and redressal of customer grievances,” said Krishna."

SBI (297.5) 
SBI has been struggling over the last few weeks for strong follow-through buyers to take it decisively above ₹300. But, at the same time, the stock is also not attracting fresh sellers to drag it sharply lower. This leaves the bias bullish. The 21-day moving average at ₹289 is a key near-term support. As long as SBI trades above this support, the possibility of the stock breaching the ₹300-₹302 support zone is high. Such a break will take the stock higher initially to ₹310 and ₹312. A further break above ₹312 can then target ₹320 and ₹322. As mentioned last week, a crucial long-term resistance is poised around ₹322. As such, the price action around it will need a close watch to get a cue on the direction of the next move. The near-term view will turn negative if SBI declines decisively below ₹289. In such a scenario, a fall to ₹282 or ₹280 is possible. Traders who have taken long positions above ₹294 can hold it with a stop-loss at ₹282. Move the stop-loss higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹307. Book profits at ₹318.










ITC (₹280.7) 
ITC was stuck in a sideways range between ₹277 and ₹284 last week. The resistance at ₹284 is continuing to cap the upside for the third consecutive week. A strong break above this hurdle is needed to ease the downside pressure for the stock. Such a break can take ITC higher initially to ₹287 and ₹290 — the next key resistance levels. If ITC manages to breach ₹290 decisively, the stock can gain momentum and target ₹296 and ₹300. But a pull-back from ₹290 can drag the stock lower to ₹285 and ₹280 again. On the other hand, if ITC continues to trade below ₹284 in the coming days and declines below ₹277, it can test ₹275 and ₹274. The outlook will turn completely negative if the stock breaks decisively below ₹274. In such a scenario, there is a strong likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹270 and ₹268. But the price action on the chart makes the bias bullish for ITC to break above ₹284. Medium-term investors who have taken long positions at ₹282 and ₹278 can hold it. Retain the stop-loss at ₹262.










Infosys (₹660.7) 
Infosys seems to be lacking strength. The stock inched up in the initial part of the week but failed to sustain higher. Infosys made an intraweek high of ₹677 and came-off sharply giving up almost all the gains made during the week. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 200-day moving average at ₹650 is a crucial support to watch out for. If Infosys manages to sustain above this support, a bounce to ₹675 and ₹680 is possible in the near term. A strong break above ₹680 will ease the downside pressure and take the stock higher to ₹700 and ₹710 levels thereafter. The region around ₹710 is a significant resistance. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹710 is needed to turn the outlook completely to positive. Such a break will then pave way for the next targets of ₹750 and ₹760. On the other hand, if Infosys declines decisively below the 200-day moving average, it can come under renewed pressure. In such a scenario, a fall initially to ₹630 can be seen. A further break below ₹630 can then drag the stock lower to ₹600 and ₹590. 










RIL (₹1,099)
RIL has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹1,050 and ₹1,150 over the last one month. Within this range, the stock fell 2 per cent in the past week. A breakout on either side of ₹1,050 or ₹1,150 will determine the direction of the next move. The 200-day moving average support is at ₹1,069. A decisive close below this support will increase the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,050. A break below ₹1,050 will take RIL initially lower to ₹1,020. A further break below ₹1,020 will then increase the possibility of the stock tumbling towards ₹900 or even ₹980 thereafter. On the other hand, if RIL sustains above the 200-day moving average support, the bias will remain positive. A strong break above ₹1,150 will ease the downside pressure. The next targets are ₹1,190 and ₹1,200. A strong break above ₹1,200 will turn the outlook to positive and will pave way for a revisit of ₹1,250 and ₹1,300. Medium-term investors can hold the long positions taken at ₹1,125 and ₹1,095. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,025. 










Tata Steel (₹487.7) 
Tata Steel tumbled 5 per cent last week. The sharp fall last week indicates that the long-term downtrend in the stock is intact. Though there is a support near current levels at ₹480, Tata Steel looks vulnerable to break below it. A break below ₹480 can take the stock lower to ₹460. A further break below ₹460 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹430. Cluster of significant supports are poised in the broad ₹460-₹430 region. There is a strong likelihood of the current downtrend halting in this support zone. A strong upward reversal from this ₹460-₹430 support zone could be a good buying opportunity for investors with a long-term perspective. As such, the price action around the ₹460-₹430 support zone will need a close watch to get a cue on the next trend. On the other hand, if Tata Steel sustains above ₹480, a bounce to ₹500 or ₹510 can be seen. But the upside is likely to be capped as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels."
186,2019-01-07,State Bank,"SBI likely to remain operational during 2-day strike 
 The banking sector may only see a partial shut-down on the two-day general strike called by central trade unions on January 8 and 9, a banking union official said on Monday.
State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest bank with 85,000 branches, is likely to remain operational on the two days, along with a few other nationalised banks, the official said.
“All the SBI branches will remain operational. Out of nine union constituents, only two have called the strike and rest are not supporting it this time,” the United Forum of Bank Unions West Bengal Convener Siddhartha Khan told PTI.
The All India Bank Employees’ Association and the Bank Employees’ Federation of India have called the strike among the banking unions.
Khan, who is also an office-bearer of the National Confederation of Bank Employees, said apart from SBI, Indian Overseas Bank and Bank of India would stay fully functional and some other banks may face partial disruption.
SBI CGM Bengal circle, R K Mishra said, banks always try to remain functional during any strike call and for Tuesday and Wednesday also, the bank expects to keep its operations normal.
The Reserve Bank of India employees, however, will support the strike on January 8.
“Two major RBI employees’ union have jointly decided to observe a strike in solidarity on January 8. On January 9 there will be a joint lunch-time gate demonstration in all offices against the Central Government’s anti-people, anti-worker, anti-national, pro-corporate policies,” the All India Reserve Bank Employees’ Association general secretary Samir Ghosh, said.
The ten central trade unions including INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, AICCTU, UTUC, TUCC, LPF and SEWA, have also called a nationwide general strike on January 8 and 9, against the “anti-people” policies of the Centre.

187,2019-01-07,State Bank,"PTC India’s NBFC arm gets up to Rs 1,400-cr long-term facilities from SBI


PFC funds will come handy for the upcoming greenfield and extension of thermal generation projects at Jawaharpur, Panki, Harduagunj, Anpara, and Obra, among others.




PFC funds will come handy for the upcoming greenfield and extension of thermal generation projects at Jawaharpur, Panki, Harduagunj, Anpara, and Obra, among others.


PTC India Financial Services Ltd (PFS), the non-banking financing arm of India’s largest power trading company PTC India, has received a sanction for long-term facilities to the tune of Rs 1,400 crore from State Bank of India (SBI).
The arrangement includes a Rs 1,000-crore long-term loan from SBI, as well as partial credit enhancement (PCE) facility to the extent of Rs 400 crore, which will support a Rs 2,000-crore bond issuance, the company said in a statement. The PCE granted by SBI would be used to secure the deficit, if any, to the subscriber to PFC’s bond issue, promising a better credit rating for the issue.
PFS added the SBI facilities availed would diversify its source of borrowings and qualitatively improve cost of finance and structure liquidity of the company. It will also help it forward credit enhanced bonds up to Rs 2,000 crore in the current and ensuing financial year.
The deal comes after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had, in November 2018, allowed banks to provide PCE limits to NBFCs in a move to ease liquidity issues for the non-banking finance sector and bring additional comfort among long-term investors.
PFS, having a total outstanding portfolio of around Rs 13,360 crore as on September 30, 2018, with the renewable sector accounting for 62 per cent of loans, has been on the path of resolution of its stressed assets in the thermal, hydro and wind power segments. The NBFC has, so far, resolved around Rs 850 crore out of approximately Rs 1,700 crore of its stressed assets in the last couple of months, the company said.

185,2019-01-10,State Bank,"SBI hits over 4-month high; may rise further
The shares of State Bank of India (SBI) gain as much as 0.72 per cent to their highest since September 3 and breaks above a resistance at Rs 305.5. Resistance is identified as the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci projection level of the uptrend from March 23 low to August 10 high.
Stock's wave pattern suggests it is in the third wave of a five-wave uptrend, the third wave is typically the longest in an uptrend. In the near term, stock may find resistance at Rs 319.25, the 76.4 per cent projection level.
Trend Intensity (TI) indicator at 17 suggests prices are trending upwards, MACD is positive and above its signal line. The stock had gained 16.1 per cent in the past three months as of Wednesday's close, compared with the broader NSE index's 5.4 per cent rise."
184,2019-01-11,State Bank,"With SBI blocking tiny accounts, social-security beneficiaries in a fix


State Bank of India is understood to have blocked the withdrawal of money from several tiny accounts in this region, which has put the economically weaker sections in deep trouble.
Bank sources, while admitting the issue, could not quantify the number of accounts that have been blocked. They maintained that the issue is being addressed. Sources reasoned that the accounts were blocked as they did not comply with KYC norms; there were also a few instances of duplication, as some of the account-holders held more than one account. 
Such accounts were opened by business correspondents by bringing those in unbanked areas into the banking fold. Initially, ‘no frills’ accounts with simplified KYC (Know Your Customer), were opened for these customers, and subsequently, they were allowed to operate only on KYC compliance after two years. Tiny account holders are mostly covered under social-security schemes such as old-age pension, national rural employment scheme, and financial assistance to the physically challenged, among others.
Such people have not been able to withdraw pension or assistance that the government provides. Sources said the bank took a unilateral decision to convert all tiny accounts into special tiny accounts, blocking the operations of tiny accounts. The conversion process is said to be tedious and could be done at the home branch.
Terming the conversion as a hasty move, Coimbatore Consumer Cause has, in a communication to the chairman of the bank, condemned the unilateral blocking of such accounts and the undue hardship the beneficiaries are being subjected to.
When asked to respond to the blocking of tiny accounts, PK Gupta, Managing Director (Retail and Digital Banking), SBI, said he was unaware of the issue and would look into it."
183,2019-01-12,State Bank,"SBI opens 100th Wealth Hub in Coimbatore


The 100th SBI Wealth Hub, and the second in Coimbatore, was inaugurated by PK Gupta, Managing Director (Retail and Digital Banking), SBI.
With this, the number of such hubs has risen to 10 in Tamil Nadu (with eight located in Chennai and two in Coimbatore)
Briefing the media, Gupta said these hubs were located across 29 centres in the country. 
The bank is targeting 50 more centres by 2020. SBI is looking at Madurai, Trichy, and Puducherry as potential centres for the launch of wealth hubs.
These hubs offer advisory services to 43,000 high net worth individuals, and the assets under management (AUM) is estimated at ₹24,000 crore. “We are aiming to increase the client base to 1.25 lakh with AUM of ₹1 lakh crore in the next year-and-a-half,” said Gupta.
On the issue of bank mergers, he said: “We believe consolidation of banks is good for the customers and employees.”"

Jet Airways on Wednesday said that it is discussing a comprehensive resolution plan with its lenders in a bid to put the ailing airlines back on track. 
“The said resolution plan, inter alia, contemplates various options on the debt-equity mix, proportion of equity infusion by the various stakeholders and the consequent change in the composition of the Company’s Board of Directors,” Jet Airways said in a statement.
“The resolution plan is presently under active discussion amongst the stakeholders and the various options therein, being privileged and confidential, are yet to be crystallised and agreed to by the stakeholders in the best interests of the Company,”it added. 
This comes even as media reports suggested that Etihad Airways has set stiff conditions, including complete exit of Naresh Goyal and his family from the management of Jet Airways. Etihad has also offered Rs 140 to 150 a share, far lower than the current market price of Rs 271 on the BSE. 
Terming the reports as speculation, Jet Airways said , “we hereby categorically state that in line with the decisions of the Board of Directors at their meeting held on 27 August, 2018, the Company has been working on various cost cutting measures, debt reduction and funding options including infusion of capital, monetisation of assets including the Company’s stake in its loyalty program, in consultation with various key stakeholders.”
“Further, pursuant to a delay in the payment of interest and principal instalment due to the consortium of Indian banks, led by State Bank of India (SBI), on 31 December, 2018, by the Company, SBI in consultation with the other members of the consortium and the other stakeholders has been working on a comprehensive resolution plan towards a turnaround of the Company for its sustained growth and restoration of financial health,”it added."

179,2019-01-16,State Bank,"SBI puts ₹15,431-crore Essar Steel debt on block 
Frustrated over the inordinate delay in the ongoing insolvency proceedings, State Bank of India has put its ₹15,431-crore exposure to the stressed assets of Essar Steel on the block.
The proceeding against Essar Steel under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has been going on for over 500 days, with no resolution in sight. Legal wrangles, counter offers and changing rules have complicated the case. SBI’s move caught market experts by surprise and has raised the possibility of similar action by other banks stuck in the insolvency proceedings.
The country’s largest bank has set a reserve price of ₹9,588 crore for the e-auction, which will be conducted on 100 per cent cash basis on January 30. The exposure is being put up for sale to asset reconstruction companies, banks, non-banking finance companies, and financial institutions.
The reserve price indicates a haircut of about 15 per cent on the ₹11,308 crore SBI would have recovered if the proposal of leading bidder ArcelorMittal had been accepted.
While ArcelorMittal has offered to pay ₹42,000 crore for the stressed asset, Essar Steel Asia Holdings, part of the defaulted promoter Ruias-owned Essar Group, has placed a bid of ₹54,389 crore which was not considered by the lenders.
Bankers expect an aggressive bidding considering that they can recover the entire money if Essar Steel’s resolution plan is accepted, said a banking source.
If the auction is successful, lenders can not only whittle down their bad loans but also reverse the provisions already made towards the stressed account, thereby shoring up the balance-sheet ahead of this financial year-end, said a senior public sector bank official.
Depending on the response to the auction, bankers expect more such large stressed corporate accounts, which are awaiting resolution at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), to be put on the block this quarter.
The Essar Steel case has gone through multiple twists and turns over the last 18 months. As things stand, the Ahmedabad Bench of NCLT has reserved its verdict till January 31 on the maintainability of Essar Steel Asia Holdings’ offer to repay the entire debt and retake the management of the debt-laden company.
Irrespective of the outcome at the NCLT, one of the aggrieved bidders is bound to go to the Supreme Court, and it will take 2-3 three months for the case to be settled, the banker said.
Despite pricing its Essar Steel exposure at a discount, SBI may not be seeing it as a loss as it has already received ₹7,469 crore against two stressed accounts — Uttam Galva and KSS Petron — from ArcelorMittal, the leading bidder for Essar Steel, said an analyst. ArcelorMittal had paid the amount to make itself eligible for Essar Steel bidding.

   -  THE HINDU


 State Bank of India (SBI) on Thursday said lenders are considering a resolution plan for Jet Airways to ensure long-term viability of the debt-laden company. 
The SBI statement comes a day after the crisis-hit airline said discussions were “progressing well” with stakeholders on a comprehensive resolution plan that also contemplates equity infusion and consequent changes in its board of directors.
There are rising concerns over financial health of Jet Airways, whose shares have also taken a beating at stock exchanges.
We would like to state that lenders are considering a restructuring plan under the RBI framework for resolution of stressed assets that would ensure a long-term viability of the company,” SBI said in a statement. 
It said the restructuring plan for the cash-strapped airline would need approval from boards of lenders.
“Any such plan would be subject to approval of boards of the lenders and subject to adherence and clearance, if required, from the RBI and/or Sebi (takeover code, ICDR regulations.) and Ministry of Civil Aviation and in compliance with all regulatory prescriptions,” the statement said."

Our Bureau


State Bank of India, on Thursday, said it has concluded its standalone issuance of fixed rate senior unsecured notes, aggregating $1.25 billion, under the so-called rule 144A/Regulation-S in two tranches.
The first tranche of five-year notes, aggregating $850 million, carry a coupon of 4.375 per cent, and the second tranche of three-year notes, aggregating $400 million, carry a coupon of 4 per cent payable semi-annually. 
The bonds will be issued through the London branch of India’s largest bank as of January 24, 2019, and will be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange and India International Exchange, GIFT City.
Fitch Ratings, on Wednesday, had assigned an expecting rating (BBB-) to SBI’s senior unsecured notes.
‘BBB’ rating indicates that expectations of default risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate, but adverse business, or economic conditions, are more likely to impair this capacity.
The credit rating agency said these notes constitute SBI’s direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations, and will, at all times, rank pari passu among themselves and with all of the bank’s other unsubordinated and unsecured obligations. 
The senior unsecured instruments are rated at the same level as the bank’s Issuer Default Rating (IDR), in accordance with Fitch’s criteria. 
IDRs opine on an entity’s relative vulnerability to default (including by way of a distressed debt exchange) on financial obligations.
“SBI’s IDR is driven by its Support Rating Floor of BBB-…The Support Rating Floor reflects Fitch’s expectation of a very high probability of extraordinary support from the India sovereign (BBB-/Stable), if needed, in light of the bank’s very high systemic importance and quasi-sovereign status,” said Fitch."

The bank is glad to announce that the issue received an overwhelming response and saw strong interest from investors across geographies with a final order book in excess of $ 3.2 billion across more than 122 accounts, SBI said in a statement.
 The successful issuance demonstrates the strong niche investor base SBI has created for itself in offshore capital markets, allowing it to efficiently raise funds even during periods of heightened currency and rates volatility, it said. Bonds were listed at India International Exchange IFSC Ltd, a subsidiary of BSE, at Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) IFSC."
175,2019-01-27,State Bank,"Bankers ready for the next challenge
The last two-and-a-half decades have been truly eventful for the Indian banking industry. The level of competition and price discovery that we see today has its roots in 1994, when six banks in the private sector were licensed to operate: they are the major competitors of state-run banks today. Further, the Narasimham Committee of 1991 and 1998 and subsequent reform measures have changed the landscape of Indian banking. 
Some of these reforms include the lowering of the CRR and the SLR; framing of prudential norms for income recognition and asset classification; introduction of capital adequacy norms; deregulation of interest rates; strengthening of legal and institutional framework for speeding the process of recovery of debts; fostering competition by giving licences to new banks in the private sector; access to capital markets for banks; structural reorganisation in the banking sector; strengthening banking supervision; and regulatory oversight of banks.
The Indian financial sector is dominated by banks. For a growing economy like India, there is a huge requirement of credit in almost all the sectors. To meet the financing needs of the economy, Indian banking needs to be healthy and robust. The continuous disintermediation effort by the government has boosted the growth of non-bank channels (including corporate bond market and capital markets) to meet the partial funding requirement of corporates. 
Credit penetration (Credit-GDP ratio) of the banking sector has substantially increased to 51.42 per cent in 2017-18 from only 20.20 per cent in 1992-93. Similarly, deposit penetration by the banking sector (Deposit-GDP) has grown from 35.7 per cent in 1992-93 to 68.12 per cent in 2017-18. These statistics clearly portray the importance of the banking sector to the Indian economy. 
In the absence of any credible term lending institution, banks have taken up the onus of providing short-term as well as long-term funding to projects and industries. However, excessive reliance of the economy on the banking sector for long-term funding requirements has made it vulnerable to economic and geopolitical contagion. However, owing to tight regulatory and prudent measures, Indian banking proved resilient to the sub-prime crisis of 2007-08, but a prolonged economic slowdown and weak corporate balance sheets have clouded the Indian banking sector in the past few years.
The introduction of niche banking and the entry of non-bank fintech and big-tech companies in the banking domain have further intensified competition in the sector. In the technological advancement process, Indian banking has worked to optimise customer experience. As a favourable demography will reshape the future of Indian banking, banks are already in the process of understanding the mindset of new millennial and Generation-Z customers who are less loyal and demand omni channel seamless service. 
The emergence of newer capabilities such as data analytics, cloud computing, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, cyber security, robotics, automation, NLP and language support, humanoids, holographic banking and robo-advisory, voice and chatbot are the new reality. To meet the banking and non-banking requirements of these young customers, SBI has launched the country's first integrated lifestyle and banking digital platform ‘YONO’. Other banks are also working on enhancing customer experience and customers’ life cycle requirements are getting integrated with CRM applications.
On the other hand, India is home to 11 per cent of globally unbanked adults. (According to the World Bank’s, Global Findex Database 2017, among the 1.7 billion unbanked adults globally, 187 million are from India.) The role of Indian banking in driving the financial inclusion agenda of the government has been lauded in international forums. As on January 2, 2019, about 33.73 crore PMJDY accounts have been opened, and the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile) initiative of the government has been able to bring the mass unbanked into the financial services net. These newly boarded customers have opened up a plethora of opportunities for banks to expand their profitable retail business as these new customers deserve numerous other services from banks apart from opening bank accounts. To meet the requirements of this vast customer base, Indian banks need to equip themselves with the latest technology to serve the needs of those unbanked as well as under-banked segments.
The consolidation of state-run banks has been one of the most discussed topics in the past two-and-a-half decades. Consolidation, by its very nature, is challenging. In the past, not all mergers and consolidations have been successful. Some of the important challenges in human resources, technology and regulatory fronts need to be properly evaluated in advance to avoid any pitfall for a successful consolidation going forward. The government has identified and is stabilising some of the weak state-run banks by resolving their bad-loans issue and adequately recapitalising them before embarking on a consolidation plan.
The Indian banking regulator has been vigilant in maintaining the health of the sector. However, a prolonged economic slowdown has led to the twin balance-sheet problem as banking is no more an isolated sector. The banking sector has to constantly upgrade and re-orient itself to tide over the balance-sheet mismatch crisis. The introduction of the long-awaited Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) 2016 has facilitated faster resolution by offering a time-bound resolution through the NCLT. Going forward, prudent management and economic recovery are likely to bring cheer to the system. 
In these years, many positive developments have happened in relation to governance aspects of Indian banks. Effective corporate governance, so critical to the functioning of the banking sector and the economy as a whole, has shown remarkable and sustainable coming of age. We are entering an exciting and challenging phase of banking in India, and fortunately the major players and various stakeholders appear eminently ready for the challenge.

India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) is set to swap part of its loans into a stake of at least 15 per cent in Jet Airways as lenders to the carrier plan similar conversions of some debt into equity to help keep the carrier alive, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Under a new rescue deal in the works for the full-service airline, founder Chairman Naresh Goyal’s stake will fall below 20 per cent from 51 per cent currently, the sources said, asking not to be identified. Etihad Airways PJSC, the foreign partner with a 24 per cent stake, is expected to infuse additional funds to take its holding to more than 40 per cent, they said.

An agreement that keeps the beleaguered airline flying would safeguard about 23,000 jobs. The Mumbai-based carrier, which has struggled with profitability in an increasingly competitive market, has piled on $1.1 billion in debt and fallen behind on paying loans and salaries. No final decision has been taken, sources said. Spokesmen for SBI and Jet Airways did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
Jet Airways has called an extraordinary general meeting on February 21 in Mumbai, to seek shareholders approval to increase its authorised share capital by issuing equity and preferred shares. The carrier is working on various options on the debt-equity mix, proportion of equity infusion, the airline said in a statement on January 16, adding the restructuring may lead to a change in the board of the company."
173,2019-01-30,State Bank,"Banks need to focus on deposit growth to manage liquidity: SBI report
 The widening gap between deposit and credit growth requires build-up of liquidity by focussing on deposit growth, which in turn could lead to hardening of interest rates next year, according to State Bank of India’s research report ‘Ecowrap’.
The report envisaged the aforementioned scenario in the event of no buyback of securities and the Reserve Bank of India not undertaking aggressive open market operation (OMO) purchase of government securities.
Against the budgeted amount of ₹75,000 crore (revised later to ₹1 lakh crore), borrowings through small savings reached ₹45,396 crore by November 2018, the report said. For FY2018, the government had completed the scheduled borrowing of ₹1.02 lakh crore through small savings scheme. 
“The large funding through the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) is possible in part owing to large interest gap between bank deposits and the small saving rates. However, this may make it difficult for banks to reduce deposit rates and hence lending rates in the near future,” the report said. 
Interestingly, in the last few months, with bank deposit growth significantly lagging bank credit growth, banks have been increasing deposit rates to protect the possibility of deposit flight from banks, it added. 
The gap between the small saving interest rate (average of Public Provident Fund and Sukanya Samridhi account rates) and average bank term deposit (greater than one year) still remains around 98 basis points. 
“Such widening gap between deposit and credit growth requires banks to manage liquidity by focussing on deposit growth. Thus, it is imperative that we make bank deposits attractive by making it tax-free,” elaborated the report.
For the fortnight ended January 4, on year-on-year basis, the report said the aggregate deposits have registered a growth of 9.9 per cent or ₹10.85 lakh crore and advances have increased by 14.5 per cent or ₹11.85 lakh crore."

Negotiated settlement preferred choice, says SBI's Managing Director Anshula Kant
   -  THE HINDU


 
India’s largest lender is finding fear can be a potent weapon in recovering loans.
With ₹1.8 lakh crore ($25 billion) in bad corporate debt to clean up, State Bank of India is having an easier time negotiating with founders keen to avoid the nation’s two-year-old bankruptcy law, according to Anshula Kant, a managing director overseeing stressed assets at the lender. That’s because a crackdown by policy makers has convinced business owners that they risk losing their companies once the courts become involved.
The first thing they say when they come to us is Madam please don’t send us to NCLT,” she said, referring to the National Company Law Tribunal, which oversees bankruptcy cases. If the founder is genuine we don’t want him to lose the company.
Recent bankruptcy proceedings that wrested prominent companies from their owners were a wake up call for India’s business community, previously used to walking away from debts without major consequences. At the same time, the regulator has pressured banks to take defaulters to court, giving lenders just 180 days to recast loans once a payment is missed.
The crackdown helped reduce the bad-debt ratio at India’s banks to 10.8 percent in September from 11.5 percent six month earlier, though it remains among the worst for a major economy. For SBI, it stands at a one-year low of 9.95 percent.
SBI is working with the founders of several mid-sized companies to restructure loans and escape bankruptcy proceedings, said Kant, who joined SBI in 1983 and was previously the lender’s chief financial officer. One-time settlements are a preferred choice if founders have funding, with the bank willing to take a haircut of as much as 40 percent, she said.
While such settlements are beneficial, founders also need investors to come forward with fresh capital to ensure companies remain viable longer-term, according to Mathew Antony, managing partner of Aditya Consulting, an advisory firm thats working with some bankrupt firms to raise money. It is equally challenging for promoters to find fresh funds, he said.
Several Lenders
India's bankruptcy law is better suited for accounts where several lenders are involved, making it hard to get everyone to agree to a restructuring, according to Kant.
Consensus building isn't the only difficulty with the fledgling law. Legal challenges from founders, losing bidders and operational creditors have forced courts to extend the 270-day deadline for debt resolution that was enshrined in the law.
SBI recently sought bids for $2.2 billion of loans to Essar Steel India Ltd. after the company's founders challenged the mills sale. Essar was among the first 12 companies forced before the nations bankruptcy court by the regulator in 2017.
Lost Income
Lenders to the so-called dirty dozen lost out on ₹4,000 crore in additional income due to delays in the resolution process beyond the time mandated by law, according to rating company ICRA. The number of cases of corporate debtors admitted before the courts that are yet to be resolved stood at 816 in September, it said.
SBI is also working to increase the amount of money it sets aside for soured corporate loans. The lender plans to raise its provisioning to about 70 percent by March 2020 from about 57 percent currently, Kant said.
We want a cleaner balance sheet, she said. It will be our endeavour that all corporate non-performing loans will be provided up to 70 percent by end of the next fiscal."

Having drawn youngsters (aged 20-30) with its integrated digital platform YONO, State Bank of India (SBI) is now gearing up to expand its reach. 
YONO, which stands for ‘You Only Need One’, is a comprehensive platform that offers lifestyle and banking services. It is experiencing around three lakh daily logins.
“Following the success of YONO among youth, we are planning to offer similar services to businessmen, globetrotters and farmers. This is being launched around April,” said SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar at a press conference here on Monday.
 “For businessmen, all their needs will be bundled under one card or services. For globetrotters and NRIs, their exclusive needs are currently being mapped.” 
“For farmers, the ‘YONO Farmer’ service will offer, in addition to farm loans, many agriculture-related services like seeds, climate or weather information, KCC (Kisan Credit Card) loans, gold loans and online mandi or market info. 
“This platform will be rolled out initially in six vernacular languages,” he added.
Since its launch in 2017, YONO has clocked 61 lakh users and registrations, said Kumar. Everyday, about 5,000 applications are logged in and about ₹50 crore disbursals are made, he added.
The bank today held the ‘YONO SBI 20 Under Twenty’ awards function.
Zaira Wasim of Secret Superstar fame, Rajasthani folk singer Jasu Khan and Indian sports shooter Manu Bhaker were among the 20 winners in 10 diverse fields. Hridayeshwar Singh Bhati, the wheelchair-bound 16-year-old who invented the Six-Player Chess, bagged the ‘Jury’s choice’ award."

State Bank of India has joined digital invoice discounting marketplace Invoicemart as a financier. Invoicemart is a Trade Receivable Discounting System (TReDS) platform of A TREDS Ltd, a joint venture between Axis Bank and mjunction services Ltd. Narayanan Sadanandan, Chief General Manager, SME and Supply Chain Finance, SBI, said: “We have taken several steps to ensure timely delivery of credit to MSMEs through other initiatives, and this association is another step towards the process of digitisation.” TReDS is a scheme for operating the institutional mechanism for facilitating the financing of trade receivables of MSMEs from corporate buyers through multiple financiers."
168,2019-02-08,State Bank,"SBI cuts rates on home loans by 5 basis points


State Bank of India, on Friday, announced a cut in interest rate on home loans up to ₹30 lakh by 5 basis points from 8.75 per cent to 8.70 per cent with immediate effect. 
With this cut, India’s largest bank becomes the first lender to get off the block in paring home loan rates after the Reserve Bank of India cut the policy repo rate from 6.50 per cent to 6.25 per cent on February 7.
 This move may prompt other lenders to follow suit.
Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI, said: “SBI has the highest market share of the home loans market, and it is only appropriate that we empower the large lower and middle class segment by transmitting the rate cut announced by the RBI.”"

The State Bank of India expects the NPA overhang in the banking sector to “dissipate in the first half of 2019-20,” said the bank’s Managing Director (GB & S), Dinesh Kumar Khara.
Speaking here at a function organised by United Way, Khara said Sashakt Asset Management Company, the newly-formed asset management company for resolution of stressed assets, would help in the resolution of “about a thousand assets worth about ₹3 lakh crore”.
He also observed that with the bad-loan problem getting solved, many public sector banks would come out of the PCA framework (a reference to ‘prompt corrective action’, a set of RBI rules that troubled banks should follow in order that they don’t go bust). 
As a result, banks would be in a position to lend more, which would help economic growth. 
The banking sector started experiencing stress after the deceleration in demand in 2016.
However, the Asset Quality Review (AQR) exercise and the RBI circular of February 2018 (which mandated insolvency proceedings for debt default beyond 180 days) accelerated the stress on bank balance sheets. Deposits and advances moderated and banks were pulled into losses, Khara said. 
NPA ratio crossed the 11-per cent mark in 2018, and only after the Insolvency and Banking Code came into force could the banks channelise their energies towards recovery of loans
Khara said that the AQR exercise (which looked at how good each loan asset was) was “a great learning opportunity for the banking system”. 
They could understand what risks they had undertaken without really measuring them.
However, he added that “the strong revival in credit growth witnessed in the second half of 2018-19 suggests that an overall improvement in the health of the banks is on the cards.” On the rupee depreciation, Khara observed that the fall in the value of rupee against the dollar was rather surprising considering that the Indian economy has been growing consistently in the last five years and the FDI inflow has been good — around $30-35 billion a year — in the four years upto 2018. This perhaps indicate that the market gives more weightage to oil prices, he said.
He said that bond yields were also moving both ways, rising with increase in crude prices and also correcting.
On the external front, Khara said that India would face headwinds from the trade war between the US and China and a ‘no-deal’ Brexit. 
The waiver given to India for trading with Iran and the US troops withdrawing from Syria and Afghanistan would also have an impact, he said."

The RBI placing restrictions on credit to unrated borrowers, or on expansion of high RWAs for banks under prompt corrective action (PCA), has also led to a fall in RWAs

The RBI placing restrictions on credit to unrated borrowers, or on expansion of high RWAs for banks under prompt corrective action (PCA), has also led to a fall in RWAs
   -  PTI


BL Research Bureau 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its Monetary Policy last week, tweaked norms for risk-weights on bank loans to NBFCs in a bid to free up capital for lending. But many public sector banks (PSBs) may well choose to shore up their capital ratios rather than grow their loan books.








 
In the past one-and-a-half years, PSBs have done just that — consolidate their loan books and reduce their exposure to risky assets. Despite the Centre’s massive capital infusion of ₹88,000 crore into PSBs in FY18, these banks have since either shrunk their loan books or grown them only modestly.
Importantly, they have reduced their risk-weighted assets (RWAs) by a faster pace (than decline in loans), implying they have been moving to safer and less risky loans assets.
Between the September 2017 (before the mega bank recap) and December 2018 quarters, the RWAs for most PSBs fell 15-20 per cent.
In the nine months ended December 2018 alone, RWAs fell 6-13 per cent for many PSBs. The RBI’s February 2018 circular on stressed assets had led to a steep rise in bad loans provisioning in the March 2018 quarter, eating into banks’ capital. Paring exposure to risky assets has eased up their capital.
The RBI placing restrictions on credit to unrated borrowers, or on expansion of high RWAs for banks under prompt corrective action (PCA), has also led to a fall in RWAs.
But non-PCA banks, such as Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank, have also reduced their exposure to risky assets since September 2017. For SBI, (as a group) too, RWAs moderated between March and September 2018.
RBI regulations require that the amount of capital a bank holds is pegged to the profile of its borrowers; riskier the borrowers, higher the capital needed.
The central bank assigns different ‘risk weights’ to different types of loans based on the possible defaults for each category. Loans to the Central government have a 0 per cent risk weight while those to commercial real estate have a 100 per cent weight. Capital ratios are determined with RWA as denominator and hence a decrease in RWAs eases up capital.
Numbers reveal that between the September 2017 and March 2018 quarters, the tier I capital ratio for weaker PSBs (placed under PCA) fell notably despite the massive capital infusion by the Centre and reduction in the banks’ RWAs. Banks such as IOB, Corporation Bank, Allahabad Bank, PNB and Andhra Bank were just about meeting their tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 7 per cent as of March 2018.
The RBI’s February 2018 circular — that did away with all old restructuring schemes — forced the banks to accelerate the NPA recognition exercise. This led to around ₹1.2-lakh crore of NPAs being added to the system and PSBs together reporting an eye-watering loss of ₹62,000 crore in the March 2018 quarter alone.
In a bid to ease up pressure on capital, PSBs continued to shrink their RWAs in the nine months up to December 2018, and their RWAs fell 6-13 per cent.
This, along with the Centre’s capital infusion and moderation in bad loan accretion, has helped improve the tier I capital ratio for some banks. Even so, some, such as UCO Bank and IOB, are just about meeting the requirement."
165,2019-02-14,State Bank,"Will reduce rates once marginal cost of funds comes down: SBI 


Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI
   -  PAUL NORONHA




Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI
   -  PAUL NORONHA


 SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Thursday said the bank has already cut the interest rate and will reduce it further with decline in marginal cost of funding.
 The Reserve Bank had last week cut the repo rate by 0.25 per cent, but the country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) announced only a 0.05 per cent reduction in interest rate on home loans of up to Rs 30 lakh. “Whatever cushion we had, we have already reduced our rates. If our marginal cost of funding comes down, then that benefit we will pass on to borrowers,” Kumar told reporters.
 Earlier, speaking at a CREDAI conference here, Kumar made a case for developing the corporate bond market to help fund projects with long gestation period and reduce the burden on banks for funding infrastructure projects. “In India, still banks play a prominent role... Bond market is sill not developed and since bond market is not developed the dependence on banks for the capital is huge. So we need to do more to develop bond market,” Kumar said.
 He said the dependence on banks for funding projects will continue for few more years till the time an alternative mechanism is developed, particularly for projects where the gestation period is long. Financing long term projects puts new responsibility on the banks who have traditionally been working capital lenders, he said."
164,2019-02-15,State Bank,"Only six PSBs cross ‘desirable’ level of 70% provision coverage ratio 


While public sector banks (PSBs) have substantially ramped up their loan-loss provisions and strengthened balance sheets in the first nine months of the current financial year, only 6 out of 21 PSBs, have crossed the ‘desirable’ level of 70 per cent provision coverage ratio (PCR) as of December-end 2018.
PCR is the ratio of provisioning to gross non-performing assets, and indicates the extent of funds a bank has kept aside to cover loan losses. 
The six PSBs that had over 70 per cent PCR as of December-end 2018 are: Bank of Maharashtra (81.08 per cent), Bank of India (76.76 per cent), IDBI Bank (75.21 per cent), Oriental Bank of Commerce (74.99 per cent), State Bank of India (74.63 per cent), and Bank of Baroda (73.47 per cent).
Though Life Insurance Corporation of India has acquired 51 per cent stake in IDBI Bank, the Reserve Bank of India has not yet notified the change in its classification as a private sector bank.
The five PSBs that were close to the 70 per cent PCR mark as of December-end 2018 are: Allahabad Bank (69.64 per cent), Central Bank of India (69.52 per cent), UCO Bank (69.49 per cent), Punjab National Bank (68.85 per cent), and Andhra Bank (68.47 per cent). The remaining 10 PSBs have PCR ranging from 58.84 per cent (Union Bank of India) and 66.60 per cent (Dena Bank).
“PCR has gone up because NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) cases (40 large corporate accounts referred to the tribunal by banks as per the RBI’s list 1 and list 2) have been substantially provided for. So, banks’ balance sheet is getting strengthened.
“The unprovided portion is narrowing down. So, going forward, profitability of banks will improve (due to write-back from recoveries),” said BK Divakara, former Executive Director of Central Bank of India. 
In a bid to ensure that banks build up provisioning and capital buffers in good times (when profits are good) so that the same could be used for absorbing losses during a downturn, the RBI, about a decade back, had prescribed that banks should augment their provisioning cushions so that their total PCR, including floating provisions, is not less than 70 per cent. 
A few years after introducing PCR, the central bank did not insist on banks maintaining 70 per cent PCR. But it now appears that 70 per cent PCR is the ‘desirable’ level that the RBI wants banks to achieve, going by Deputy Governor Viral Acharya’s speech last October."
163,2019-02-15,State Bank,"Banks have ₹20,000-cr exposure to IL&FS
Surabhi


Banks have reported an exposure of nearly ₹20,000 crore to debt-ridden Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), and could see further pain in their balance sheets in the coming quarters, though much would depend on the resolution process, according to analysts.
Data compiled by BusinessLine revealed that as many as 14 public and private sector lenders have a cumulative exposure of ₹18,256 crore to the IL&FS Group in their quarterly results, though not all of it has been categorised as ‘non-performing’.
State Bank of India, Bank of India and Bank of Baroda have announced the highest exposure to IL&FS in their third-quarter results, although some of it is still performing.
SBI, for instance, has an exposure of ₹900 crore to IL&FS, for which it has increased the provision to 50 per cent. It also has an exposure of ₹2,200 crore to 12 special purpose vehicles of the group, but these loans are still performing.
Similarly, Bank of India, which reported a net loss of ₹4,738 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2018, said it has an exposure of ₹3,400 crore.
Among the private sector lenders, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are understood to have negligible exposure to the infrastructure group, while Axis Bank has about ₹800 crore of loans. Private sector YES Bank, which posted a near 7 per cent drop in its profits in the third quarter, also had an exposure of ₹2,529 crore to various SPVs of IL&FS, though it did not name it specifically.
“Elevated slippages from accounts under IL&FS offset strong improvement in overall asset quality for most banks under coverage – 80 per cent of overall slippages for YES Bank, 30 per cent for Bank of Baroda and 7 per cent of slippages for Axis Bank were from accounts under IL&FS,” said a report by Kotak Institutional Equities, on the third-quarter performance of banks. 
According to a November 2 research report by Bernstein, the aggregate debt of IL&FS amounted to ₹94,200 crore, of which, nearly 40 per cent is owed to state-owned banks. In all, the group accounts for 0.6 per cent of the total banking credit, the report said, adding that its top five creditors to the group are SBI, Bank of Baroda, Power Finance Corporation, Bank of India and IndusInd Bank.
“Most of the private sector banks with large exposures to IL&FS have disclosed it, like IndusInd and YES Bank, which cumulatively have ₹5,600 crore exposure to the group. 
“However, there have been differences across banks in classifying the exposure as NPA,” said Bernstein analysts Gaurav Jangale and Monica Agarwal, adding that recognition of IL&FS exposure as NPA will be a one-off event, leading to higher NPA ratios. 
However, higher credit costs will put pressure on future profitability, especially if resolution drags on, they further said.
Banks, through the Indian Banks’ Association, are likely to seek another relaxation from the Reserve Bank of India to defer the provisioning requirements for their exposure to IL&FS.
“Most banks will see some more pain in the fourth-quarter results, but it will be a one-off pain. I don’t think there will be a significant impact as lenders will manage to get at least a part of their money. 
“But it will depend on the resolution plan,” said another analyst who did not wish to be named, adding that the impact of the unfolding developments at Dewan Housing Finance will also have to be seen."
162,2019-02-17,State Bank,"SBI takes work-life balance to a new high 
 The nations largest lender State Bank of India has begun a massive employee engagement programme to ensure its 2.6 lakh-strong staff does not work mechanically and is sufficiently motivated to take on newer challenges that the future will throw up, a top official has said.
The programme, named Nayi Disha or the new path, focuses on work-life balance and also involves the staffs immediate family members, also giving them the ability to inform the bank if an employee is not able to leave work on time.
We realised that over a period of time, our employees, especially the ones in branches, had started to work mechanically which could have an impact on customer service and also their morale, Prashant Kumar, deputy managing director and chief development officer, told PTI over the weekend.
The previous chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya too had initiated a slew of pro-employee measures such as letting them choose the location before transferring a couple of both of them are with the bank, extending sick leave to attend to in-laws health needs, long leaves to help their children during the exams among others.
He said the bank has hired an external hand to design the programme, and started implementing it in December with the top management, including chairman Rajnish Kumar.
Over 350 trained staff are reaching out to every employee in the programme, which is the first major initiative reaching out to every member of the staff in over four years. They undertake five to six hour-long sessions which end with a team dinner with each ones spouses, Kumar said.
Half the staff has already undergone the module and the programme will be finished by March 15, in time to let the employees focus on the heavy duty workdays towards the end of the fiscal year, he said.
At the end of the training module, the employee signs a pledge which draws from the banks value statement released last year, vowing to keep herself healthy, not damage the environment, speak positively of the bank and leave for home at least once a week.
Interestingly, the pledge card has a special bar code which, if scanned by the employees spouse using a mobile phone, will send out an alert to the employees superiors about the employee spending long time at work and result in corrective action, Kumar said.
Without mentioning non-performing assets, Kumar said the banking sector has had a difficult time in the last two-three years which has affected the employees and the bank found it essential to rejuvenate and prepare them for the future as well.
While stressing that the worst is behind the bank, the employee is told about the business plan and also the way banking is changing due to technology, which will entail changes in their working as well, he said.
The bank had already started stressing on the importance of employees health and the need to maintain work-life balance around a year ago, Kumar said, adding this programme takes it up as a strong need.
Over 27 per cent of SBI staff are women and the average age has now come down to 43, he said."

Fitch Ratings has assigned BBB- to SBI’s senior unsecured notes


As technological shifts make more inroads into banking, the nations largest lender SBI has decided to replace only 75 percent of its retiring workforce over a five-year period and is benefiting from the prevailing poor jobs scenario by getting the best of candidates for the roles on offer, a senior official has said.
In a situation akin to the one observed in the Railways, the State Bank Group has got close to 28 lakh job applications for 8,000 clerical jobs in the last two years.
Starting 2018 fiscal, it has begun hiring only about 10,000 to replace the over 12,000 retirements annually, and 80 percent of the new recruits joining as a clerks are either MBAs or engineers.
“It is very good for us. We are getting good people at clerical levels who are adept with technology and other tools.
Career progressions are also happening fast, as most of them will appear for internal exams to be promoted as officers after joining as clerks,” Prashant Kumar, deputy managing director and corporate development officer, told PTI.
Last year, the Railways had received a whopping 23 million applications for 90,000 posts that it was filling up.
A government job is always sought-after due to the life-time financial security and the other social benefits it offers.
Banks globally are re-aligning to changing realities due to the advent of technology.
British banking major HSBC has decided to nearly halve its network presence in the country, while its peer Standard Chartered axed 200 here due to automation.
The board has come out with a five-year roadmap in 2018 to replace only 75 percent of the retiring employees every year, he said, adding an average of up to 10,000, including 8,000 clerks and 2,000 officers are being hired annually as replacements.
The retirements will hit a peak in fiscal 2020 at 12,500, after that the number will start receding further, he said.
The new recruitments are helping get the average age of employees down, helping the bank become a much more vibrant organisation, with the average age coming down to 43, from 48 five years ago, Kumar said.
There is a clear shift in the areas for which the new recruitments are happening, with the share of branch banking coming down over time, he said.
The new roles which are opening up include those in varied functions like advisory loans and wealth management, recovery, risk management as well as analytics, he said.
Kumar said as much as 87 percent of the bank’s overall transactions are happening outside branches today, and the present hiring reflects these ground realities.
Apart from fresher recruits, the bank also hires specialists directly from the market offering market rates, he said.
The bank does not go to campuses like its private sector peers which go directly to reputed B-schools for hiring talent, he said, explaining that it is restricted by the process which lays focus on direct recruitments."

 To recover its loans from Jet Airways, state-run lender State Bank of India (SBI) is mulling moving National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) as it feels the airline is running out of funds for operations, even as shareholders of the debt-laden carrier have approved a debt rejig plan, officials said.
Shareholders of Jet Airways have approved conversion of loan into shares and other proposals during the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on Thursday.
A consortium of banks, led by the SBI, has extended loans to Jet Airways, which is looking to rejig debt and raise funds.
Officials associated with the lenders and key shareholders said the SBI is considering moving the NCLT seeking insolvency proceedings against Jet Airways since it is running out of money for operations.
Lenders can initiate proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to recover dues from debt-laden entities. The process can commence only after approval from the NCLT.
Queries sent to SBI and Jet Airways regarding the bank considering insolvency proceedings against the airline remained unanswered.
The officials said that Gulf carrier Etihad, the strategic partner with 24 per cent stake in Jet Airways, abstained from voting on various proposals during the EGM held on February 21.
According to them, Etihad is waiting for clarity on the overall funding that the SBI and National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) would provide for Jet Airways in terms of equity.
The Gulf carrier has been pitching for the SBI and the NIIF to own 51 per cent and invest Rs 2,200 crore into the airline, they added.
On February 17, sources said Jet Airways was likely to invest Rs 3,000 crore post debt-rejig and investments by Etihad Airways as well as NIIF.
Besides, the SBI is not agreement with Etihad on the latter’s proposal regarding Right of First Refusal (ROFR).
Etihad has sought ROFR for itself after one year and also want the SBI to get a confirmation from markets regulator Sebi that if ROFR is exercised, then the mandatory open offer would not be triggered, the officials said.
Under the Sebi norms, entities are required to make an open offer to shareholders in case their shareholding goes beyond a certain threshold.
A consortium of banks is considering an interim funding of Rs 500 crore for Jet Airways but a final decision is yet to be taken, Punjab National Bank (PNB) Managing Director (MD) Sunil Mehta said on Friday.
PNB is part of the lenders’ consortium, led by State Bank of India (SBI), that has extended loans to the airline.
On February 14, Jet Airways’ board approved a Bank-Led Provisional Resolution Plan (BLPRP), whereby lenders would become the largest shareholders in the airline.
Following approval from the shareholders, part of debt would be converted into 11.4 crore shares at a consideration of Re 1 apiece as per the RBI norms.
Later, appropriate interim credit facilities by domestic lenders would be sanctioned to the airline, according to a regulatory filing made on February 14."

State-run lender, State Bank of India (SBI) has denied media reports on approaching the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to recover dues from the Naresh Goyal-led Jet Airways. The bank said that “no such decision has been taken” and the media reports were “speculative.”
The airline has loans of over ₹ 8,400 crore, with SBI being its biggest lender. SBI’s exposure is said to be close to ₹ 2,000 crore. The lenders also have the opportunity to appoint one or more persons as nominee directors or observers on the board of the company.

Jet Airways promoter and Chairman Naresh Goyal is said to have flown down for the meeting bloomberg


 In a bid to resolve various issues between Jet Airways, Etihad Airways and lenders, State Bank of India has called for an urgent meeting on Wednesday. 
A source said Naresh Goyal, Chairman and promoter of Jet Airways, along with representatives of Etihad, has flown down to India for the meeting. Another source said the meeting will be held at SBI’s corporate office here. Etihad CEO Tony Douglas is also likely to attend it, said reports.
SBI is the lead lender of a consortium that has extended loans to Jet Airways.
 “Jet Airways has been having meetings regularly with SBI, but this one is fairly important given that Goyal, along with representatives from Etihad and lenders, are all going to be present to discuss the issues face-to-face,” said a company source. 
Jet Airways has been facing a financial crunch for the past several months, owing to which it has delayed salaries to pilots, senior staff and engineers, and payments to its lessors and lenders.
These delays led to lessors grounding a couple of the company’s aircraft till the time payments weren’t cleared. If that was not enough, pilots have now decided to agitate with a black-band protest.
The airline has been making constant efforts to restructure itself, and proposed a restructuring plan to its shareholders and other stakeholders.
 Last week, it called for an EGM to propose the same to its shareholders. About 98 per cent of the shareholders approved the proposals under all five categories.
Currently, Goyal owns a 51 per cent stake while Etihad owns 24 per cent. The rest of the shares are owned by public institutions and other shareholders.
According to sources, Etihad was not convinced with the plans and thus had abstained from voting. BusinessLine had earlier reported the Gulf-based carrier was not present at the EGM as well and that its absence had led to mayhem among minority shareholders.
The airline has loans of over ₹8,400 crore, with SBI being its biggest lender. SBI’s exposure is said to be close to ₹2,000 crore. 
Jet and Etihad had said in a joint statement yesterday they, along with key financial stakeholders, are working towards finalisation of a bank-led provisional resolution plan for the debt-laden domestic airline.
Jet Airways’ stock on Tuesday fell 2.14 per cent to close at ₹224.25."

SBI (272.9) 
SBI began the week on a weak note and fell about 2 per cent initially. However, the stock managed to reverse sharply higher from the low of ₹266.3, recovering all the loss. The price action on the charts over the last couple of weeks leaves the near-term outlook positive. A key support is at ₹267, which is likely to limit the downside. An upmove to ₹280 and ₹285 is likely in the near term. A cluster of resistances is poised in the ₹280-285 zone. Inability to breach this resistance region can drag SBI to ₹270 again. But a strong break above ₹285 will boost the momentum and increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹295 and ₹300 in the coming weeks. Short-term traders with a high-risk appetite can go long at current levels and accumulate at ₹269. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹265 for the target of ₹285. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹276 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹279. The 200-week moving average at ₹260 is a crucial support. The outlook will turn negative only if SBI declines below this support.










ITC (₹277.8) 
ITC has been stuck in the ₹273-284 sideways range for more than a month now. Within this range, the near-term outlook is bullish. ITC has risen and closed above the 21-day moving average at ₹276.5, which will now act as a good support. As long as the stock trades above this support, an upmove to ₹284 is possible in the near term. A pull-back from ₹284 levels will keep the sideways range intact and take the stock lower to ₹277-275 again. But a decisive close above ₹284 will mark the end of the sideways consolidation. It will then take the stock initially to ₹289. A further break above ₹289 will then trigger a fresh rally, targeting ₹301. The bullish outlook will get negated only if ITC breaks below 273. The next target is ₹265. But the price action on the chart keeps the bias positive and leaves the possibility high of the stock breaching ₹284 in the coming days. As such, investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at ₹282, ₹278 and ₹272. Retain the stop-loss at ₹262.










Infosys (₹741.1) 
Infosys surged to a high of ₹757.8, but later gave back most of the gains. The near-term outlook is unclear. The 21-day moving average resistance is at ₹747. A decisive close above it is needed to turn the outlook to positive. Such a break can take Infosys higher to ₹790 and ₹800. But as long as the stock trades below ₹747, a dip to ₹725 cannot be ruled out in the near term. A break below ₹725 will then take the stock lower to ₹710 or even ₹700 thereafter. However, a further fall below ₹700 looks unlikely. A cluster of supports poised between ₹710 and ₹700 is likely to limit the downside. An upward reversal from the ₹710-700 support zone will trigger a fresh rally to ₹745 and ₹750. A further break above ₹750 will then give rise to targets of ₹770 and ₹790. Medium-term traders can make use of dips to go long at ₹725. Accumulate longs at ₹720 and ₹715. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹680 for a target of ₹790. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹735 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹755. 










RIL (₹1,226.7) 
RIL inched lower for the third consecutive week. The 21-day moving average resistance at ₹1,248 continued to cap the upside in the stock for the second consecutive week. RIL can remain range-bound between ₹1,200 and ₹1,250 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹1,200 or ₹1,250 will decide the direction of the next move. A strong break above ₹1,250 can take the stock initially to ₹1,260. A further decisive break above ₹1,260 will boost the momentum and increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹1,300 and ₹1,320 in the short term. On the other hand, if RIL declines decisively below ₹1,200, the stock will come under renewed pressure. In such a scenario, RIL can fall initially to ₹1,175. A further break below ₹1,175 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹1,145. It will also confirm the head and shoulder reversal pattern on the daily chart. This is a bearish pattern, which may keep the stock under pressure. Investors can hold the long positions taken at ₹1,260, ₹1,245 and ₹1,225. Retain the stop-loss at ₹1,180 for the target of ₹1,420.










Tata Steel (₹507.1) 
Tata Steel has been moving higher as expected, but at a slow pace. The stock was up 1 per cent last week. The short-term outlook continues to remain positive. A near-term resistance is at ₹517 — the 100-day moving average. A pull-back from this resistance can trigger a fall to ₹495 and ₹490. A further fall below ₹490 looks unlikely at the moment. An upward reversal from the ₹495-490 support zone will take the stock higher to ₹515 levels again. An eventual break above the 100-day moving average resistance will then increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹545 and ₹550 thereafter. The upmove from the January low of ₹442 is significant as it happened from the 200-week moving average support. Whether the current move is a trend reversal or just a corrective rally will become clear in the coming weeks. Short-term traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹502. Retain the stop-loss at ₹480 for the target of ₹545. Revise the stop-loss higher to ₹510 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹517."

152,2019-03-08,State Bank,"SBI plans to link SB deposits and CC/OD accounts to RBI repo rate 


In a significant move, State Bank of India (SBI), on Friday, said it will link savings bank (SB) deposits with balances over ₹1 lakh and all cash credit (CC) accounts and overdrafts (OD) with limits above ₹1 lakh to the repo rate with effect from May 1.
This move comes in the backdrop of the RBI directing banks to link all new floating rate personal or retail loans (housing, auto) and floating rate loans to micro and small enterprises to one of the four external benchmarks – policy repo rate/ 91 days treasury bill / 182 days treasury bill/a benchmark market rate produced by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd – from April 1.
India’s largest bank will link SB deposits, with balances above ₹1 lakh to repo rate with current effective rate being 3.50 per cent per annum (2.75 per cent below current repo rate of 6.25 per cent). Repo rate is the interest rate at which the central bank provides liquidity to banks to help them overcome short-term liquidity mismatches.
All CC accounts and ODs, with limits above ₹1 lakh, will also to be linked to the repo rate (current repo rate 6.25 per cent plus a spread of 2.25 per cent). The risk premiums over and above this floor rate of 8.50 per cent would be based on the risk profile of the borrower, as is the current practice.
“In order to address the concern of rigidities in the balance sheet structure and address the issue of quick transmission of changes in RBI’s policy rates, effective from May 1, SBI has taken the lead in linking its key pricing decision for SB deposits and short-term loans to the repo rate of the RBI,” SBI said in a statement.
The bank has decided to exempt SB account holders with balances up to ₹1 lakh, and borrowers, with CC/OD limits up to ₹1 lakh, from linkage to the repo rate."

   -  Bloomberg


 A day after State Bank of India (SBI) decided to link its short-term loans and large savings deposits rates to the repo rate, chairman Rajnish Kumar on Saturday said loans and deposits below Rs 1 lakh will continue to be linked to the present marginal costs for funds-based lending rates (MCLR) to protect retail customers from market vagaries.
In a first, the nations largest lender had Friday said from May 1, it would link its savings accounts with deposits over Rs 1 lakh and all cash credit accounts and overdrafts or short term loans with limits above Rs 1 lakh or short-term loans, to the repo rate, which currently is at 6.25 per cent.
At present some banks like Kotak Mahindra, Yes Bank, RBL Bank and Singaporean lender DBS Bank pay higher interest to the tune of 5-6 per cent on savings deposits regardless of the balance, while large players like SBI and other state-run lenders, and private players like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and others pay 4 per cent per annum.
From May 1, the savings bank deposits with balance above Rs 1 lakh will earn an interest of 3.5 percent, 2.75 per cent lower than the repo rate and lower amounts in balance will earn 4 per cent.
The bank has also linked all cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above Rs 1 lakh to the repo rate plus a spread of 2.25 per cent.
“The category which we have linked to the external benchmark is the best category--all cash credits and overdrafts above Rs 1 lakh. Here also, for accounts with Rs 1 lakh and below, we’ve kept out of the purview as we believe that retail customers should not be forced to suffer from the market vagaries,” Kumar told reporters on the sidelines on event organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce.
He also said, across the world, retail loans are not left to the market forces alone when it comes to pricing and that it is mostly corporate accounts that are left to the market conditions.
He also said the move is in accordance with the RBI guidelines on the MCLR and other loan pricing norms.
Kumar said SBIs retail loans are currently priced as per MCLR and the system is working well and will continue to be remain so.
 “Retail loans will continue to be linked to MCLR for the time being. If the loan is long-term in nature, you cannot re-price it very frequently...that way MCLR is a good solution,” Kumar said.
 He said by linking savings bank deposits rate to the repo rate, MCLR will get adjusted automatically as and when there is a change in the repo rate.
 He, however, said MCLR will not move by 25 bps if there is a similar reduction by the RBI in the repo rate.
 “It will depend on what portion of our savings banks gets repriced and its consequent impact on MCLR. To that extent the MCLR will get repriced,” Kumar said.
 Currently, the bank is offering a rate of 3.50 percent for savings bank deposit rates up to Rs 1 crore, and 4 percent above Rs 1 crore.
 As much as 33 percent of its savings account-holders will get the benefit of the new pricing system, the bank said.
 On the thorny issue of swift monetary transmission, Kumar said liabilities are mostly fixed for banks and transmission on the asset side alone cannot happen.
 “Transmission cannot happen only on one side. If transmission has to happen it has to happen on both sides and that is why SBI came out with this solution that the deposits savings bank account with 1 lakh and above, we will link it to repo rate and all the working capital loans which are theoretically payable on demand.
 Talking about National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) clearing ArcelorMittal’s Rs 42,000-crore bid for Essar Steel rejecting the Rs 54,389 crore offered by a company run by the Ruias of Essar group, Kumar said they are awaiting the final order.
 “The written order is yet to come. But our stand as well as that of the committee of creditors is that we abide by the order. The final process of the resolution of Essar Steel began with the NCLT order yesterday,” he said.
 Kumar said in the case of Jet Airways, whatever is the resolution plan, it will be implemented if all the conditions by all stakeholders--Naresh Goyal, lenders, Etihad and approval from the Government, are met."
150,2019-03-10,State Bank,"SBI’s new ‘alliances dept’ to co-originate loans to priority sector with NBFCs
 
In a two-pronged strategy, State Bank of India has set up a ‘non-banking finance company (NBFC) alliances’ department so that it can step up direct lending to various segments within the mandated priority sector lending (PSL) category and simultaneously reduce investment in low-yield funds with development finance institutions.
Through the new department, the country’s largest lender intends to co-originate loans with NBFCs for lending to the priority sector and buy PSL portfolios from NBFCs. 
This will help SBI have more direct exposure to PSL, which will fetch better yield on advances, and cut down indirect exposure, where the yield on investment is low. Loans given by banks to agriculture, micro, small and medium enterprises, exports, education, housing, social infrastructure, and renewable energy are classified as PSL. The PSL target for banks is 40 per cent of their adjusted net bank credit (ANBC). Compliance of this target is monitored by the Reserve Bank of India on quarterly basis. 
Banks have to make up for any shortfall in lending to the priority sector by contributing to the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) established with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) and other funds with Nabard/National Housing Bank (NHB)/Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI)/ Micro Units Development & Refinance Agency (MUDRA) and buying PSL certificates issued by banks with PSL surplus.
“The NBFC alliances department will work on the co-origination model. The RBI issued a circular on co-origination of loans by banks and NBFCs for priority sector (in September 2018). So, we believe that lot of the small value PSL loans can be originated through this route. So, we are examining which are the companies we can work with,” said PK Gupta, Managing Director, SBI.
According to the RBI, all scheduled commercial banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks and Small Finance Banks) can engage with NBFCs (which are in the Non-Deposit taking and Systemically Important category) to co-originate loans for the creation of priority sector assets. The arrangement should entail joint contribution of credit at the facility level, by both lenders."
149,2019-03-11,State Bank,"How does SBI’s move to link savings deposit and short term loan rates to repo rate impact you?
It was about two years ago that SBI made the first move and cut savings deposits rate by a tidy 50 basis points. With other banks having followed suit, low-value savings deposit rate currently fetch 3.5 per cent (against 4 per cent in the past). If depositors were rattled by the banks’ move then, SBI’s move to link savings deposit rate to repo rate effective May 1, implies more pain in a rate easing scenario — savings deposit rates can move even lower if the RBI cuts repo rate in the coming months.
SBI has linked savings bank deposits, with balances above ₹1 lakh to repo rate — 2.75 per cent below repo rate. At the current repo rate of 6.25 per cent, this works out to the 3.5 per cent. While this implies that there will be no immediate impact for depositors, if the RBI cuts repo rate by 25 bps in its next policy review in April, savings deposits with SBI would fetch a lower 3.25 per cent.
On the other hand, SBI has also linked cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above ₹1 lakh to repo rate. Hence borrowers would gain when the RBI cuts repo rate, as lending rates on these short-term loans would become cheaper.
On other variable rate loans such as home loans or corporate loans too, lending rates should move lower as SBI’s cost of funds will come down, forcing a MCLR (marginal cost of funds lending rate against which such loans are benchmarked) cut.
Hence while you may cringe at the lower rate as a depositor, as a borrower, you can hope for faster cuts in lending rates.
There is no denying that SBI’s move linking savings deposit rates with repo rate will hurt depositors in a rate easing scenario. But the impact may not be much for a depositor with low value deposits in absolute terms. Consider this: On ₹10 lakh deposit, RBI’s 25 basis point cut will imply a loss of ₹2,500 annual interest, if savings deposit rate move from 3.5 per cent to 3.25 per cent. On a ₹1 crore deposit, the impact will be a higher ₹25,000 of interest loss.
Given that a chunk of the deposits (about 90 per cent) is below ₹1 crore, most depositors will not see a big impact of lower savings deposit rate. Of course, frequent and faster cuts could hurt in the short term. But importantly, SBI’s move will bring in more transparency in the way savings deposit rates are fixed.
Interest on the savings account was deregulated in October 2011. But nearly all banks stuck with offering a 4 per cent rate on the savings deposit, even in rising rate cycles. This cartelisation of sorts was broken in July 2017, when SBI cut savings deposit rate by 50 bps. But other banks were quick to follow and since then, rate on low-value savings deposits has been stuck at 3.5 per cent. Even when banks were increasing fixed deposit rates aggressively last year, they did not hike savings deposit rates.
SBI’s move to link savings deposit rates to repo rate could change the opacity and rigidity in savings rate. Hence in a year or two later, when RBI starts to increase the repo rate, SBI’s savings deposit rate would also move up, benefitting depositors.
In a bid to fix the perpetual issue of transmission, the RBI had mandated banks to peg their lending rates on new floating rate for personal loans, retail loans and loans to micro and small enterprises from April 1, 2019, to external benchmarks.
For now SBI has linked cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above ₹1 lakh to the Repo Rate—2.25 per cent above repo rate. Hence a 25 bps cut in repo rate would imply an immediate respite for such borrowers.
For other borrowers too a rate cut by the RBI could lead to faster reduction in lending rates than in the past. Why?
The key structural issue with transmission has been that banks source only a minuscule portion of their funds (1 per cent) from the repo window and rely significantly on longer term deposits. Hence only about 50-60 per cent of banks’ funding gets re-priced.
Hence a cut in repo rate does not immediately reduce their costs. Linking savings deposits to repo rate can iron out this issue to some extent. For SBI about 37-40 per cent of deposits are savings deposits, of which a chunk are above Rs 1 lakh.
This implies that about 30-35 per cent of deposits will get repriced with changes in repo rate. Hence a 25 bps repo rate cut could result in 6-9 bps reduction in benchmark MCLR. Lending rates on loans such as home loans, corporate loans etc. linked to MCLR would fall faster, benefiting borrowers.
However the adhoc way in which banks determine spreads — over and above the benchmark lending rate to arrive at the effective lending rate — still remains a concern and could impede transmission. Also, it needs to be seen if other banks would follow suit.
Adhoc practices followed by banks while fixing lending rates under MCLR, slow migration to MCLR regime by banks etc., have impeded transmission under MCLR in the past."
148,2019-03-11,State Bank,"Limited impact
The decision by State Bank of India (SBI) to switch to floating rates for its savings accounts appears to be a smart move designed to pre-empt RBI’s April deadline for Indian banks to move to external benchmarks for setting lending rates. Henceforth, SBI’s interest rates on savings accounts with balances above ₹1 lakh will be pegged 2.75 per cent below RBI’s repo rate and its cash credits and overdrafts will be priced at a minimum 2.25 per cent over it. While SBI’s move is clearly an attempt to ward off criticism that Indian banks are tardy with their transmission, it is a moot point if it will result in a material reduction in lending rates across the economy.
As the MPC pruned repo rates by 200 basis points between 2015 and 2017, sticky lending rates emerged as a key bone of contention between the regulator and domestic banks. Banks have always argued that the high cost of their legacy deposits stood in the way of quicker transmission. SBI is attempting to address this rigidity by floating its savings account rates. But it is unrealistic to expect SBI’s move to trigger an across-the-board decline in lending rates for three reasons. One, the savings accounts on which rates have been floated make up just a third of SBI’s deposit base. The pass-through of MPC’s future rate cuts to SBI borrowers will therefore remain partial, with every 25-basis point repo rate cut estimated to result in a 7-8 basis point fall in loan rates. Two, SBI has retained flexibility to price its individual loans at a spread over its official lending rate, based on the borrowers’ risk profile. Like the earlier MCLR regime, this still allows the bank to arbitrarily tweak its spreads to protect its margins. Finally, while SBI with its dominant position and comfortable credit-deposit ratio, can probably afford to offer low rates on its savings accounts without a dent to its CASA, the same cannot be said of its competitors, who have lost deposit share to private banks at a furious pace in the last five years. SBI’s move may thus force its peers to either pay higher floating rates on their savings accounts or refrain from floating them, both of which will impede transmission.
Overall, this only goes to show that, however hard the RBI may try, it cannot really force banks to take pricing decisions that are detrimental to their commercial interests. Having tried out many formulaic approaches — Base Rates, MCLR and external benchmarking — it is time the RBI paid attention to the only factor that can ensure seamless transmission — more market competition. In recent years, the RBI’s conservative stance on issuing new bank licences, and its complicated ownership rules have contributed to discouraging many new players from entering the banking space. Remedying this is the best way to ensure that Indian banks don’t sacrifice their customers’ interests at the altar of profitability."

145,2019-03-20,State Bank,"Lenders to make every effort to keep Jet Airways flying: SBI 
 SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Wednesday said the lenders of Jet Airways will make every effort to keep the embattled airline flying.
Kumar met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley along with Aviation Secretary Pradip Singh Kharola and Nripendra Misra, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister. “Will make every effort to keep Jet airways flying,” Kumar told reporters.
A source said banks are trying to work out a revival plan for Jet Airways through a change in management.
On getting a new player in Jet Airways, Kumar said, “No possibility is ruled out”. “The dialogue with Etihad is on. It is not that they have conclusively decided that they will go out. But there are certain conditions which they want to be fulfilled and it is nothing but that the airline should be professionally managed and without any interference,” he added.
Etihad currently holds 24 per cent stake in Jet Airways.
Keeping Jet Airways flying is in the interest of lenders and consumers, the source added.
The pilots union of Jet Airways had on Tuesday threatened to stop flying from April 1 if their salaries are not paid by March 31.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said only 41 aircraft of the Jet Airways were currently available for operation and there may be “further attrition” of flights “in coming weeks”. 
Kumar further said that taking Jet Airways under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is the last option."

The immediate crisis in Jet Airways has been warded off for now, with Naresh Goyal, his wife and the Etihad representative stepping down from the Board and lenders providing it a lifeline by infusing ₹1,500 crore. 
However, it might be too early to celebrate this new lease of life as the real issues for Jet start now — the most significant of which is finding a long-term solution .
Analysts believe that after this cash infusion, depending on how smartly the money is usedand how much additional revenue is generated by flying more planes and concentrating on profitable routes, the airline can keep going for 3-4 months at least. This, however, will not help the airline deal with, what an industry watcher calls, the fundamental problems Jet has been facing. These include high costs, an ageing wide body fleet and the pressure that rival are exerting on it. 
A clearer picture of who is interested in Jet Airways will emerge only by April 19 when the expression of interest is made public.
 All domestic airlines would be keen on getting a piece of Jet Airways as it has a huge number of slots within the country and abroad. Another factor that favours Jet is the large ‘Frequent Flyer’ base the airline has managed to build over the years. 
It could be leveraged by another carrier if it were to pick up a stake in Jet Airways.
Some argue that it makes sense for SpiceJet to acquire the airline as there is fleet commonality — both Jet Airways and SpiceJet operate a Boeing fleet. 
Incidentally, SpiceJet is said to be in talks with leasing companies to take over many of Jet Airways’ aircraft, which are currently grounded for non-payment of lease rentals. Others say with the amount of free cash that IndiGo is sitting on it could look at buying Jet Airways to grow as a company. Announcing its latest financial results in January, IndiGo had said that it had a strong balance sheet with total cash of ₹14,136.1 crore, including free cash of ₹4,618.3 crore and restricted cash of ₹9,517.8 crore as on December 31 last year. Jet’s current liability is around ₹8,000 crore. They, of course, need to overcome some practical difficulties . Both SpiceJet and IndiGo are low-cost airlines. If either f them buys Jet, one question that is most likely to arise is that whether Jet Airways staff will be able to meet the new owner’s requirements of turning around the aircraft for the next flight in about 30 minutes which is something that low-cost airlines try to achieve to sweat their planes to the maximum .Even the mindset involved in running a low-cost and a full service airline is different. Meshing the two will be a tall order.
Further, the world over the experience of buying or integrating an existing airline with a new one has not always been pleasant .
In India, the merger of Air India with Indian Airlines and Jet’s acquisition of Air Sahara did not have happy endings. “Integration issues in an airline merger are always a nightmare,” a senior official said .
Arvind Jadhav, Chairman and Managing Director of Air India, had told a Parliamentary committee in 2010 that nowhere in the world had any merger really been successfully completed. “If you take the Delta-Northwest airlines, today if you go to the United States and ask the pilot or a cabin crew he will say, ‘I am a Deltan. I am a North-western.”
How Jet’s future pans out remains to be seen. , At the moment, Jet staff and the flying public can breathe a temporary sigh of relief as a a short-term solution has been found."

A day after Jet Airways chief, Naresh Goyal, stepped down from his position as Chairman, pilots have written to State Bank of India Chairman, Rajnish Kumar, requesting him for a meeting to give clarity on the salary dues.
The pilots have asked Kumar to help alleviate some of the hardships that they have been facing by ensuring that the Jet Airways management does not further delay the release of their pending salaries and clear all dues at the earliest.
The 1,100 pilots, represented by the National Aviators Guild (NAG,) held an Annual General Meeting last week and decided to stop flying on from April 1 due to non-payment of salaries for the past three months. 
In its letter to the Labour Ministry, NAG flagged off that 87.5 per cent of the December 2018 salary along with 100 per cent salaries of January and February 2019 are pending."

141,2019-03-28,State Bank,"SBI issues fresh advisory against ATM frauds 


State Bank of India (SBI) has come out with a detailed advisory to customers in view of the increasing reports of ATM frauds, and has emphasised the need to be more “alert, cautious and vigilant in their own interest”.
“The public, at large, should be aware of the risk factors while downloading apps on their mobile devices, cards taken for use in PoS machines not within sight, or unintended sharing of OTPs to prevent skimming/cloning.” 
The advisory by the Local Head Office of SBI here has urged customers not to share banking password/PIN with any one, store them in a mobile device, or share such sensitive information when asked for over the telephone. Do not encourage calls from unknown numbers related to ATM/bank matters. In case of suspicious or fraudulent calls, get it disconnected immediately and bring it to the notice of the bank, the bank said.
Banks have also made available security features such as fixing up daily/monthly/weekly limits based on customer requirement to reduce chances of falling prey to fraud and losing money through internet banking, or through apps developed by them. 
SBI YONO allows customers the facility to withdraw money without using a card at the ATM. There are also apps that allow the customer to keep the banking activities locked by enabling the app-lock feature on payment and mobile banking apps.
“Ask your bank to guide you if you are not aware of such facility by virtue of which you can switch on/off as and when necessary, and keep the card in switch-off mode when not in use,” the advisory said. 
Mag-stripe cards are now being replaced by EMV chip cards. Any person using an ATM card should ensure that the card held by him/her is totally protected from attack by fraudsters. All banks prefer customers to change frequently the ATM PIN, which is to be done very secretly. While changing the PIN number, it must be ensured it is not in a format that is easily guessable. 
For instance, avoid using first or last four digits of the card/mobile/telephone number, date of birth or year of birth. 
Many frauds have been perpetrated by making a trial and error method of using such details. 
“Never allow strangers to guide you to installing ‘AnyDesk’ or similar apps. Banks send SMS alerts to the registered mobile number regarding withdrawal of money or transaction done for e-commerce/PoS purchases using cards linked to the number.”
Immediately on receipt of such alert messages, cardholders have to act fast as per message received. Banks accept return SMS messages to a specified mobile number in the alert message, or expect a call in the toll-free number, if the transaction is a fraud."
140,2019-03-31,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (320.8)
The uptrend in SBI is gaining momentum. The stock surged 7.6 per cent last week, breaking above the key resistance level of ₹305. Resistance is near current levels at around ₹321. A pull-back from that can trigger a corrective fall to ₹315. A break below ₹315 can drag the stock lower to ₹305. However, the bias continues to remain positive. So, a further fall below ₹305 looks less probable. A bounce from ₹305 will have the potential to take the stock above ₹321. In such a scenario, a rally to ₹350 is likely. The indicators on the charts are positive. The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 55-, 100- and 200-day moving averages. This is a strong bullish sign, indicating that the downside could be limited and the uptrend is likely to remain in place. Short-term traders can wait for dips and go long at ₹315 and accumulate at ₹308. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹295 for the target of ₹350. Revise the stop-loss to ₹325 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹335.










ITC (296.7)
ITC was volatile last week. The stock fell initially to a low of ₹291.2 and bounced back to make a high of ₹302.95. However, it fell in the final trading session of the week, giving back all the gains and closed on a flat note. The resistance at ₹302 is holding well. ITC has to make a decisive close above this hurdle to regain strength and move higher. The next target is ₹309. The level of ₹309 is a key long-term trend resistance. Inability to rise past this level can trigger a corrective fall to ₹302 or ₹300. But a strong break above ₹309 will increase the likelihood of the rally extending to ₹320 and ₹322 over the medium term. On the other hand, if ITC continues to trade below ₹302, a dip to ₹293 or ₹290 is possible. Investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at ₹282, ₹278 and ₹272 with a revised stop-loss at ₹289. Move the stop-loss further higher to ₹301 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹305. Book profits at ₹310.










Infosys (₹742.3)
Infosys tumbled 3 per cent intraweek and made a low of ₹719.6. However, the stock reversed sharply higher recovering all the loss. The bias remains positive on the chart. The 21-day moving average at ₹726 is a key support. The quick bounce from ₹719 indicates that the stock is getting fresh buyers below ₹726. So as long as the stock trades above the 21-day moving average support, there is a strong likelihood of it moving higher to ₹750-₹755. A further break above ₹755 will then increase the likelihood of the uptrend extending to ₹780. The short-term outlook will turn negative only if Infosys makes a decisive close below the 21-day moving average. A fall to ₹705 or ₹700 is possible. A further fall below ₹700 looks less probable at the moment. Medium-term traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹725, ₹720 and ₹715. Retain the stop-loss at ₹680 for the target of ₹790. Revise the stop-loss to ₹735 as the stock moves up to ₹755.










RIL (₹1,363)
RIL opened the week with a gap-down and fell to a low of ₹1,317.15. However, the negative sentiment was short-lived and RIL clawed back, recovering all the loss and closed 1.5 per cent higher for the week. The support at ₹1,316 mentioned last week has held very well. This leaves the bullish outlook intact. A near-term resistance is at ₹1,385, which is likely to be tested in the coming days. Inability to breach this hurdle can drag the stock lower to ₹1,350 initially. A further break below ₹1,350 will then increase the likelihood of the downmove extending to ₹1,315 or ₹1,310. But, if RIL manages to break above ₹1,385, it can gain fresh strength. In such a scenario, RIL can surge to ₹1,400. A strong break above ₹1,400 will be very bullish from a long-term perspective. This will pave way for ₹1,450 and ₹1,500 over the long term. The outlook for the stock will turn negative only if RIL declines below ₹1,300. Such a break can trigger a corrective fall to ₹1,260 and ₹1,250.










Tata Steel (₹520.8)
Tata Steel continued to consolidate for the fourth consecutive week. The stock has been stuck between ₹505 and ₹532. A breakout on either side of ₹505 or ₹532 will decide the next move. If Tata Steel breaks the range below ₹505, it can fall to ₹495 or ₹490. But such a fall looks less likely as the price action on the chart leaves the possibility high of the stock breaking above ₹532. The stock is well above the 21-week moving average level of ₹507. As long as it trades above this support, the bias will remain positive. A strong break above ₹532 will take Tata Steel to ₹540. A further break above ₹540 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting ₹560 over the medium term. Traders can hold the long positions taken at ₹518 and ₹512. Retain the stop-loss at ₹487 for the target of ₹555. Revise the stop-loss to ₹515 on a rally to ₹525.

Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, State Bank of India, has exhorted his bank’s 2.60-lakh-odd employees to roll up their sleeves to deliver an operating profit of about ₹70,000 crore in FY2020.
In view of the volatility caused by one-off income, India’s largest bank intends to focus on operating profit in general, and, in particular, operating profit from core operations. 
SBI clocked a lower standalone operating profit of ₹38,503 crore in the first nine months of FY2019, against ₹43,628 crore in the year-ago period.
Referring to the operating profit earned by the bank in the last two years, Kumar, in a communication to the bank’s staff, said some part of this has been contributed by one-time items such as disinvestment/initial public offer of SBI Life, and sale of non-core assets/strategic disinvestment, among others. But growth in operating profit from core banking operations has been slightly lower.
The SBI chief underscored that one-time items, or exceptional items, tend to distort the comparison of the profitability trend, where profit should be a function of the core operating performance, rather than from exceptional items.
The bank wants to target a higher core operating profit to take care of unexpected exigencies resulting in higher provisioning.
Further, a robust operating profit will also lead to improvement in efficiency parameters, such as return on assets, return on equity, cost to income ratio, and net interest margin, among others. 
Among profitability parameters, the bank is eyeing return on assets (net profit/ average total assets) of 0.70 per cent for FY2020 (against 0.001 per cent for the nine months of FY2019); bringing down the cost to income ratio (non-interest expenses/net total income) to less than 50 per cent (against 56.97 per cent as on December-end 2018); and optimisation of net interest income (by focussing on increasing current account deposits and considering increase in interest charged to borrowers, especially those enjoying below-card rates).
Each of the bank’s five business units – national banking group, corporate accounts group, commercial clients’ group, global markets unit, and international banking group – is expected to achieve the business targets, which will flow from the targeted operating profit."

 SBI has invited expression of interest from asset reconstruction companies and financial institutions to sell two non-performing accounts to recover dues of over Rs 423 crore. The e-auction for the NPA accounts - Kamachi Industries and SNS Starch - is scheduled for April 25, 2019, SBI said in an expression of interest (EoI) invite.
“In terms of the bank’s policy on sale of financial assets, in line with the regulatory guidelines, we place these accounts for sale to banks/ ARCs/NBFCs/ FIs,” SBI said.
Steel maker Kamachi Industries has an outstanding of Rs 364.80 crore while SNS Starch --which manufactures and exports various grades of starch -- owes Rs 58.87 crore to SBI. The reserve price for sale of Kamachi Industries is fixed at Rs 165 crore and SNS Starch at Rs 36.56 crore.
“The interested banks/ARCs/ NBFCs/ FIs can conduct due diligence of these assets with immediate effect, after submitting EoI and executing a non-disclosure agreement with the bank,” SBI said. The sale will be on 100 per cent cash basis, the bank said."
135,2019-04-08,State Bank,"SBI bifurcates Mumbai circle 
State Bank of India, on Monday, launched Mumbai Metropolitan Business region as a separate circle. The new circle has been formed by bifurcating the Mumbai circle. India’s largest bank, in a statement, said the existing Mumbai circle has been bifurcated to form two circles – Mumbai (metro) and Maharashtra circle – with effect from April 1, 2019. The new circle is the bank’s 17th circle.
The new Mumbai (metro) circle has 423 branches, 26 central processing cells, 10 regions, four zones, and two networks.
It covers branches in Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, and Raigad districts. The total deposits and advances of the Mumbai (metro) circle as on March 31, 2019, was ₹1,44,398 crore and ₹42,036 crore, respectively. The erstwhile Mumbai circle covering Maharashtra and Goa State was the largest circle under the SBI’s National Banking Group.
Rajnish Kumar, Chairman SBI, said: “We believe at the new Mumbai (metro) circle there would be seamless business process mobilisation that will help the bank give focussed attention to customers of Mumbai and surrounding areas, which contribute a major share of business of the circle.”"
134,2019-04-09,State Bank,"SBI reduces lending rate by 5 basis points across tenors
Nearly a week after the Reserve Bank of India cut its policy repo rate by 25 basis points, State Bank of India on Tuesday pared its benchmark lending rate by 5 basis points across all tenors, making loans in segments such as home and vehicles cheaper.
Further, to make housing loans more affordable, the bank has reduced the interest rate by 10 basis points on loans up to ₹30 lakh.
The 5 bps cut in the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) across all tenors, with the benchmark one-year MCLR coming down from 8.55 per cent to 8.50 per cent, by SBI may encourage other banks to follow suit.
SBI’s lending rate cut will take effect from April 10. All rupee loans sanctioned and credit limits renewed with effect from April 1, 2016, are priced by banks with reference to the MCLR, which is the internal benchmark for such purposes.
The bank, in a statement, said the interest rate for housing loans below ₹30 lakh will range from 8.60 per cent to 8.90 per cent (from the existing rates of 8.70 per cent to 9 per cent).
In early March, SBI said that in order to address the concerns regarding rigidities in the balance sheet structure and quick transmission of changes in RBI’s policy rates, it will link Savings Bank (SB) deposits and short term loans to RBI’s repo rate of RBI with effect from May 1.
So, from May 1, while SB deposits with balances up to ₹1e lakh (comprising almost 95 per cent of the SB account holders) will earn 3.50 per cent interest, those with balances above this threshold will earn 3.25 per cent (2.75 per cent below the repo rate, which is currently at 6 per cent).
The central bank cut its policy repo rate (the interest rate at which it provides liquidity to banks to overcome short-term mismatches) on April 4 from 6.25 per cent to 6 per cent.
SBI said the benefit of reduction in repo rate will get passed on in its entirety to its Short Term Loan -- Cash Credit (CC)/Over Draft (OD) -- customers with effect from May 1.
All CC/OD customers with limits above ₹1 lakh will be charged a minimum (floor) interest rate of 8.25 per cent (repo rate plus a spread of 2.25 per cent) against the current 8.50 per cent. The risk premiums over and above this floor rate would be based on the risk profile of the borrower, as is the current practice.
Following in the footsteps of SBI, the Indian Overseas Bank has also pared its MCLR by 5 bps in tenors of one year and above with effect from April 10. The Chennai-headquartered public sector bank’s one-year MCLR will be 8.65 per cent against 8.70 per cent now.
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das last week said the central bank is conscious of the fact that there has to be effective transmission of rates.
“After the last meeting I had with public and private sector banks, they have marginally, up to about 10 basis points, cut their MCLR; but more needs to be done,” he said."

 Air Canada has emerged as the dark horse in the race to acquire Jet Airways. The Canadian airline, along with Etihad, is among the top contenders for the debt-laden Indian airline. 
Heartened by the interest from these foreign carriers, State Bank of India, the lead lender to Jet Airways, on Wednesday extended the deadline for Expression of Interest to April 12. 
“The earlier deadline was set for April 10 but some of the international airlines that are interested asked for more time. There are more than two investors who are interested in putting in a bid,” said a top source.
 According to another source, Air Canada has sent a written application to the state-run bank seeking an extension.
According to one of the persons cited above, “Since Air Canada is an overseas airline and there is a time difference with India, the airline needs time for due diligence. The lenders have agreed to give an extension.”
Malaysian carrier Air Asia and Tata Sons joint venture Vistara are also understood to be among those who have sought a clarification from lenders. Jet Airways’ current joint venture investor Etihad Airways had also confirmed its interest in bidding for the beleaguered airline.
After April 12, lenders will examine the eligibility of all those who have expressed interest. Thereafter, the eligible bidders will have to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) after which the company will be given some time to examine the books of the airline. “The qualified bidders will be expected to submit their respective binding bid(s) latest by April 30 subject to the terms set out under the bid document,” SBI Capital Markets said in a notice posted on its website."

Air India is looking at leasing five Boeing 777 of Jet Airways which temporarily suspended operations on Wednesday night.
While officially the airline declined to comment on the subject, sources indicated that the state-owned carrier had been in talks with Jet Airways for about 10 days for taking these five aircraft.
Ashwini Lohani, Chairman and Managing Director, Air India, is said to have written to the SBI Chairman about the possibility of leasing these five aircraft although the official spokesperson declined to confirm this development.
Read: Jet Airways lands with a thud as lenders decline interim funding
Air India will use the Jet aircraft to operate international flights and could look at operating them on various routes, including Mumbai-London Mumbai, Mumbai-Dubai-Mumbai and Delhi-Singapore-Delhi. Incidentally Jet Airways operated flights on all these routes before it suspended operations.
Besides Air India join SpiceJet too said on Thursday that it was planning to induct another six of Jet’s Boeing 737 800 Next Generation on dry lease within the next 10 days.
A dry lease involves taking an aircraft without the operating crew. The six aircraft being leased will be taken for periods varying from two to six years.
This the second time in less than a week that SpiceJet has decided to lease the Boeing 737 aircraft which were earlier registered and being flown by Jet Airways and this decision of leasing six more of Jet’s Boeing 737 aircraft comes less than 24 hours after the airline announced a temporary suspension of all operations on Wednesday night.
On April 12, SpiceJet had said it was inducting 16 Boeing 737 NG that were earlier registered in the name of Jet Airways.
SpiceJet has also announced that it will launch 24 new daily flights connecting Mumbai and Delhi with other cities on its domestic network.
In a statement, the airline said this will includes flights on the Mumbai-Hyderabad-Mumbai, Mumbai-Coimbatore-Mumbai and Mumbai-Mangaluru-Mumbai routes apart from enhancing flights on the Delhi-Bengaluru-Delhi route.
In the coming days, more domestic airlines could come forward and seek other assets of Jet Airways including its slots at airports in India and abroad."
132,2019-04-18,State Bank,"SBI falls after Jet stops operations indefinitely
Shares of State Bank of India Ltd fall as much as 2.4 per cent to Rs 308.05, in their biggest intraday drop since March 27. Jet Airways (India) Ltd, which halted operations indefinitely on Wednesday, has debts of roughly $1.2 billion, with SBI being its biggest lender.
Lenders led by SBI rejected Jet's plea for emergency funds on Wednesday, with a source telling Reuters that “bankers did not want to go for a piecemeal approach which would keep the carrier flying for a few days and then again risk having Jet come back for more interim funding.”
Jet Airways’ shares were hammered on Thursday, falling as much as 34 per cent to their lowest in over 10 years.
SBI has a forward PE of 54.12, more than double the sector avg of 23.97. Up to Tuesday's close, stock had risen 6.7 per cent this year, compared with an 8.5 per cent increase in the broader NSE index.
The stock of SBI closed lower by 1.5 per cent at Rs 310.90 in the BSE index while in the Nifty the stock ended 1.76 per cent lower at Rs 310.20.
The scrips of Jet Airways nosedived 32.12 per cent to Rs 163.90 in Sensex and in the broader index, the scrip plunged 31.08 per cent to Rs 165.75."
130,2019-04-19,State Bank,"Lohani may meet SBI chief over leasing of wide-body Jet planes 
 Air India Chairman Ashwani Lohani is likely to meet State Bank Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Friday over the national carrier’s plans to lease five wide-body Boeing planes from the now grounded Jet Airways.
 Weighed down by a mountain of debt and falling revenue, Jet Airways announced suspension of its entire operations from Wednesday night and owns 16 wide-body planes, 10 B777-300ERs and six Airbus A330s. The SBI-led consortium of lenders are now running the airline under a debt recast plan.
 The Air India chairman had written to SBI chief on Wednesday expressing interest in taking on lease five of the Boeing 777s from Jet and deploy them in key international routes. And the meeting, expected to take place in New Delhi, is in furthering this. “Lohani is expected to meet Kumar today to discuss his plans of leasing five Jet Airways’ B777s. Air India is keen to launch more international routes and enhance frequencies on the existing ones.
 “But it does not have additional aircraft to do so. If it is able to strike a deal with Jet lenders, it can expand the international operations further,” a source privy to the development told PTI. The Air India spokesperson was not available to confirm or deny the meeting.
 In a dry-lease arrangement, the lessor gives out only the aircraft to a lessee, while in wet-lease, the aircraft comes with the complete crew, maintenance and insurance. After the grounding of Jet, Air India is the only domestic carrier now operating services on long haul and ultra-long haul routes like London, Paris, New York, Washington, Chicago and San Francisco, among other cities.

 Lenders are exploring ways to utilise about 15 planes owned by Jet Airways and also discussing with authorities on protecting the valuable assets, including airport slots, of the now-shuttered airline, banking sources said.
 As they wait for completion of the bidding process for stake sale, the domestic lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), are looking at options to raise funds from available assets of the carrier, which has served the Indian skies for nearly 26 years.
 Left with no cash to continue flying, the once-mighty Jet Airways on Wednesday suspended operations temporarily -- a decision that has also left more than 20,000 employees as well as various other stakeholders in the lurch.
 The sources said the lenders are actively considering proposals, including from Air India, for utilising the planes owned by Jet Airways. The use of these idle planes would ensure that they remain in good condition as well as earn revenues, they added.
 Jet Airways owns 16 aircraft, including 10 wide-body Boeing 777-300 ERs, rest of the planes were on lease. The full-service carrier had more than 120 planes in its fleet last year.
Read: For pilots flying last Jet plane, it was a flight filled with emotion and hope
 Earlier this week, Air India Chairman and Managing Director (MD) Ashwani Lohani wrote to SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar saying that the airline is looking at leasing five of Jet Airways’ Boeing 777s and operate them on London, Dubai and Singapore routes.
 As concerns mount over the future course of Jet Airways, the sources said lenders have been proactive and cannot be blamed for the current situation at the airlines.
“They (lenders) have been actively engaging with the company for almost nine months ever since the airlines started incurring cash losses and have been urging the management to come forward with a definite plan for resolution.
“Unfortunately, the management and the promoter delayed in taking a decision leading to the present situation. The lenders continued to support the airline during this period,” one of the sources said.
 The decision of founder-promoter Naresh Goyal to step down came as late as March 25 and he signed a binding agreement to facilitate stake sale only in the second week of April. By then, the airline’s operations had been severely affected, the source added.
 The source also said that banks have now put in place a transparent bidding process for a new investor to take over the airline and the outcome would be known by May 10.
 According to the sources, lenders have also reached out to relevant authorities to protect valuable assets for the airline, such as airport slots, as it would improve the chances of a better revival. The best revival prospect would be to have a new investor who brings in sufficient cash and also has a definite plan going forward, they added."
128,2019-04-19,State Bank,"SBI wasting Indian taxpayers’ money on UK legal fees: Mallya


Vijay Mallya




Vijay Mallya


 
Embattled liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya once again used social media to reiterate his offer to pay back the debt owed to public sector banks in India, targeting this time the State Bank of India (SBI) for allegedly wasting Indian taxpayers’ money on expensive legal fees in the UK.
Days after a UK High Court judge refused to dismiss an interim order freezing nearly £260,000 in one of his London bank accounts, the 63-year-old issued a string of statements on Twitter to allege that the SBI-led consortium of PSU banks were wrongly going after him in the UK courts.
“SBI lawyers in UK making presentations on their accomplishments against me. Indian tax payers cost. Despite full recovery in India confirmed by the Prime Minister himself,” he tweeted on Friday.
His statements were illustrated with a series of document screenshots showing TLT LLP, the banks’ law firm, hailing its victory in the £1.142-billion worldwide freezing order judgment in their favour last May.
“SBI UK lawyers in self-promotion at Indian public cost. SBI must answer,” reads Mallya’s tweet."

The EMI per ₹1 lakh will be lower at ₹1,468 for 96 months against ₹1,622 for 84 months, based on the maximum tenor, in line with the existing scheme. “SBI Green Car Loan (Electric Vehicle) scheme, which comes with the longest repayment period of up to eight years, is a strategic inclusion to the bank’s auto loan segment offered with zero processing fee for the first six months of the launch,” the lender said in a statement on Monday."

A probationary officer of the 1988 batch, Swaminathan has experience in diverse areas such as international banking and credit. He has served in assignments such as DGM, Global Trade Services; and Vice-President Head (Trade), SBI New York, according to a release.
Since 2017, he has been working as CGM of SBI Hyderabad Circle. During his tenure as CGM, he had supervised the successful integration of State Bank of Hyderabad’s operations with SBI after its merger with its parent bank.
He had also overseen the smooth implementation of Telangana State Government’s Rhythu Bandhu Scheme, which attracted national attention."
125,2019-04-26,State Bank,"SBI, other lenders refuse salary fund to Jet Airways employees until bidding process is complete: CEO


All the efforts of the Jet Airways CEO to secure salary payments seem to have gone in vain. State Bank of India, the lead lender is “unable to make any salary commitments, if at all, until after the bidding process is complete,” Vinay Dube, CEO of Jet Airways, informed his employees in a letter on Friday afternoon.
“We have told them repeatedly that our employees are facing grave hardship owing to non-payment of their salaries and that if this were to continue any longer, our employees would have no option but to find employment elsewhere. Unfortunately, the banks have said they are unable to make any salary commitments, if at all, until after the bidding process is complete. We face this reality despite our best efforts to portray the very real suffering that is being endured by each one of you,” Dube’s letter added.
Last week, Kiran Pawaskar, MLC with NCP and the President of the All India Jet Airways Officers’ and Staff Association had met the management, including Dube. After the meeting Pawaskar had conveyed the management’s message that, “The Jet Airways management will decide in a week whether the employees need to work till May 10 (when a potential investor’s name will be announced) or not.” Jet Airways has 16,000 permanent employees and 6,000 contractual employees.
“While we will continue to support the lender-led bid process in our effort to leave no stone unturned, it pains us to communicate that no clarity or commitment on salaries has been provided by any of our stakeholders,” Dube added.
On Thursday, Pawaskar told BusinessLine that the management was unable to give any update on the salaries. “The management has asked for more time. All their attempts and requests to SBI have been futile so far. When the request of one month’s salary was declined, they asked for 50 per cent of it. That too has not been accepted. The management told us that they have not communicated to their employees whether they need to come to work or not and have left it to them to decide.” He further added that they have approached the Labour Ministry, as well, to discuss the matter.
“While on the one hand, we are being told to preserve the value of Jet Airways during the bid process, on the other hand, with no salary payment, some of our colleagues, who are the very fabric and value of this airline, have no choice but to find employment elsewhere. When we highlight the disappointing irony of this situation to the lenders, we are simply told that this problem is to be addressed by the company’s shareholders, who should and could have agreed on a Resolution Plan a long time ago,” Dube added. So far, according to company sources, 400 people have resigned from the company. According to the source, the company owes over Rs 450 crore in salaries to pilots, engineers and general managers, among other staff members.
“Separately, there have been considerable deliberations in the various board meetings regarding the availability of emergency funding from the Promoter and Strategic Shareholder for payment of salary arrears, with no favourable outcome,” the Jet Airways chief added.
On Saturday, Dube, along with the CFO, Amit Agarwal and other employee representatives had met Arun Jaitley, Minister of Finance. According to Dube, Jaitley had assured that he would request SBI to look into the matter of salary. However, Dube’s letter stated that it had not yielded positive results thus far.

 With the debt recovery process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code getting delayed, State Bank of India has moved the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) to encash personal guarantees worth ₹15,000 crore extended by the promoters of Essar Steel.
In one of the largest-ever personal guarantee cases filed in India, SBI has moved the tribunal in Ahmedabad with a suit against Prashant and Ravi Ruia — Essar Steel’s promoters — to recover the amount. 
Essar Steel’s lenders are saddled with dues of over ₹63,000 crore, including overdue interest and penalties. Lenders had filed an insolvency case against the company in 2017. Early last month, the NCLT approved the ₹42,000-crore bid placed by ArcelorMittal, leading to a hair-cut of ₹21,000 crore for lenders. SBI has now moved the DRT to recover the shortfall in Essar Steel’s dues.
An Essar official, who did not want to be named, said the promoter guarantees are not at risk because the ongoing debt resolution process will repay at least 92 per cent of the debt to the secured financial creditors. Under the insolvency process, admitted claims of secured financial creditors of Essar Steel amounted to ₹45,000 crore. 
Per Arcelor Mittal’s resolution plan, secured financial creditors will get about ₹42,000 crore. Further, EBITDA earned by the company is to be paid to creditors. “Thus, there will hardly be any shortfall to secured financial creditors. Personal guarantees were extended for only part of secured loans (about ₹11,000 crore). Considering a recovery as above from the approved resolution plan, there may not be any shortfall and guarantees are not at risk,” the official said. 
Speaking to BusinessLine, an Essar spokesperson said: “Total admitted dues of the secured creditors as verified by the Resolution Professional of Essar Steel are ₹45,000 crore. Essar Steel Asia Holdings Ltd has already offered to repay the secured creditors these dues in full, and Arcelor Mittal’s plan provides for ₹42,000 crore.” 
SBI had invoked the personal guarantees of the Ruias about 6-8 months back and has now filed suit seeking an order from DRT. A DRT decree will lead to attachment of all personal assets of the Ruias in India and abroad, said a source.
The Essar Steel case has gone through many twist and turns, including the offer from Essar Steel promoters Ruias to repay the entire outstanding debt (excluding penalty) of ₹54,389 crore. However, the NCLT rejected the Ruias offer and approved ArcelorMittal’s plan.
But then the Supreme Court has ordered a status quo in the case and ordered ArcelorMittal not to deposit any money with the banks after some operational creditors objected to the manner in which the money from ArcelorMittal is to be distributed among creditors."
123,2019-04-28,State Bank,"Consider a bull-call spread on SBI
 
The outlook for State Bank of India (₹313.60) remains positive. The stock finds immediate resistance at ₹330 and a conclusive close above that will lift SBI to new heights. The stock finds immediate support at ₹279 and only a close below ₹252 will alter the current positive outlook. While the stock may face intermittent volatile sessions ahead, we expect the undertone to remain positive.
F&O pointers: SBI May futures added over 2 per cent or 12.57 lakh shares in open interest. SBI futures also maintained its premium, signalling longs build-up. Options trading indicates that the stock could move in a range of ₹300-330 as ₹300-put and ₹330-call carry high open interests.
Strategy: Traders can consider a bull-call spread on SBI, using ₹315-strike and ₹325-strike calls. They closed with a premium of ₹11. 9 and ₹7.75 respectively. Traders will have to incur an initial outflow of ₹4.15 a contract. As the market lot is 3,000 shares, this will cost ₹12,450, which would be the maximum loss one can suffer. A maximum loss will happen if SBI closes below ₹315. A maximum profit will be achieved if premium rises ₹5.85 a contract. This will happen if SBI closes above ₹325. We advice traders to hold the position till the expiry.
Follow-up: Stop loss would have triggered for Indusind Bank."
121,2019-04-30,State Bank,"Repo-link effect: SBI savings a/c holders with balance above ₹1 lakh to get lower interest 


Savings bank account holders in SBI having more than ₹1 lakh balance will earn a quarter percentage point less interest from Wednesday, with the country’s largest lender linking interest rate to the RBI’s repo or short-term lending rate.
 However, SBI savings bank account holders with less than ₹1 lakh balance will continue to get 3.5 per cent interest on deposits.
 According to the information provided on the website of State Bank of India (SBI), the interest rate on savings bank accounts with balances above ₹1 lakh will be 2.75 per cent below the RBI’s repo rate, which currently stands at 6 per cent.
 Hence, SBI will give 3.25 per cent interest on savings bank deposits with balance exceeding ₹1 lakh. At present, the interest rate is 3.5 per cent and the interest is paid quarterly. The interest rate on such balances will go up in case the RBI hikes the repo rate, and may fall further if the repo rate continues its downward journey.
 SBI, which controls nearly a quarter of the banking system, was giving interest at a rate of 3.5 per cent for savings bank deposits up to ₹1 crore and 4 per cent for deposits above ₹1 crore till Tuesday.
Earlier, in March, SBI had announced that it would be linking its savings deposits rates and short-term loans to the RBI’s repo rate from May 1 with the aim to ensure faster monetary transmission."

Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI
   -  PAUL NORONHA




Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI
   -  PAUL NORONHA


The top lender of ailing Jet Airways said the burden of reversing the grounded carriers negative net worth before it can fly again is the biggest challenge for any potential investor.
Liabilities and losses are considerable, Rajnish Kumar, Chairman of State Bank of India, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Thursday. All these past liabilities and then, profitably, can they fly in future? These are some of the considerations which are weighing upon the minds of the potential investors.
Creditors led by State Bank of India have put Jet Airways up for sale after the carrier failed to pay back debt. Once India’s biggest airline by market value, Jet Airways has been a victim of a budget airline boom in the fiercely competitive market in the South Asian nation, where carriers offer base fare of as low as 1 cent to lure first time flyers.
The airline, which stopped all flights last month, has made losses in nine of the past 11 years. Jet Airways has seen lessors taking away its aircraft while rivals start services on routes it previously operated.
The deadline for submission of binding bids to take over control and ownership of Jet Airways is May 10, Kumar said. The lenders, to which the airline owes more than $1 billion, have yet to take a call on how much debt will be forgiven, he said.
Jet Airways, the oldest surviving private airline which broke into a monopoly of Air India, had a fleet of 124 and flew profitable routes like connecting India with London and Toronto. With almost 23,000 jobs at stake, the airlines woes could not have come at a worse time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is seeking a second term based on his business-friendly image."
119,2019-05-06,State Bank,"‘More employees ‘engaged’ in contributing to SBI’s growth’


State Bank of India has more employees ‘engaged’ than ‘disengaged’ when it comes to contributing to its growth and finding satisfaction in their work, according to its employee engagement survey.
While the survey results will bring cheer to its top management, India’s largest bank wants to address concerns among employees in areas such as work-life balance, appreciation/ recognition, promotion and transfer policies, among others. The survey, ‘Abhivyakti’, conducted among 1,91,881 employees, found that 63 per cent of employees come under the overall ‘engaged’ category (28 per cent are in the ‘engaged’ category and 35 per cent in the ‘almost engaged’ category).
The rest are under three categories – ‘crash and burners’ (16 per cent); ‘disengaged’ (14 per cent); and ‘honeymooners and hamsters’ (7 per cent).
The survey was conducted between December 28, 2018, and January 19, 2019, to understand the pulse of the employees, as the bank moves towards realising its vision to be ‘the bank of choice for a transforming India’. “We feel proud to see that the employees share a high sense of pride and belongingness with the bank. It is reassuring to note that most of you are aware of the long-term vision and values of the bank. This strong connect will be nurtured to continue our success story,” said SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar in a communication to employees.
Kumar observed that there are also areas that SBI must focus on – work-life balance, building a culture of appreciation, and need to make people feel valued through employee-recognition programmes."
118,2019-05-07,State Bank,"SBI to seek consultant’s help to draw up long-term growth plan


State Bank of India is seeking to engage the services of a consultant to suggest strategies to improve Return on Assets (RoA) and pre-provisions operating profit (PPOP) by increasing income from different sources, reducing cost, and optimising the balance sheet.
The consultant is expected to to draw up a portfolio strategy and long-term growth opportunities for India’s largest bank; and strategies for current account acquisition and increasing its balances, in addition to optimising ALM (asset-liability management) to maximise returns, and pricing optimisation for SME and retail portfolio.
The consultant will also be required to suggest cost-optimisation measures, and build a balance sheet optimisation tool for long-term capital allocation through the cycle. 
In addition, it will also need to develop a tool to assess payback period for key initiatives and projects.
When it comes to portfolio strategy and long-term growth opportunities, the bank wants to benchmark its overall portfolio with peer banks; identify long-term growth opportunities; identify opportunities for improvement in the share of high yield products – personal loans, business loans; and look at strategic portfolio shifts and balance sheet steering mechanisms.
On the current account acquisition and ALM strategy front, the bank is eyeing initiatives to improve current account acquisition; strategies to minimise the maturity mismatches across time buckets with a focus on utilising the surplus available in the respective buckets to maximise returns; and strategy for benchmarking and optimising MCLR (marginal cost of funds-based lending rate).
When it comes to cost optimisation, including physical footprint, network and physical technology assets costs, overheads and others, the bank wants a rethink on the role of branches/offices and what activities/processes can be centralised; identify opportunities for overall infrastructure cost reduction; and baseline current IT spend by category and payback period.
The bank, which had a deposit level of ₹28,30,538 crore and advances of ₹20,47,779 crore as on December-end 2018, said deliverables have to be designed and executed to its satisfaction in a 12-month period starting from the date of commencement of the project."

 An association representing Jet Airways pilots has filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court to direct State Bank of India to release interim funding of ₹1,500 crore in a bid to pay salaries and keep the company afloat until a new investor takes over.
The appeal, filed by the National Aviator’s Guild (NAG), has raised questions on why the bank did not go through with the funding as notified by the company to the stock exchanges on March 25. 
It has also raised questions on other actions including de-registration of aircraft and allotment of Jet’s slots to other airlines. These actions, ahead of the bidding process to identify a new investor, may have destroyed the value of the company, the NAG alleged. 
 The plea has been filed under Articles 21 and 32 of the Constitution against Jet Airways, SBI, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the Airports Authority of India (AAI), and the Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru international airports.
However, legal experts said the pilots may not have a strong case. “I think the writ will be dismissed tomorrow because Jet Airways is a private party and if the Supreme Court is to hear a writ petition filed against lenders and government authorities on this ground, they will have to accept it for all other entities as well,” said Ravi Kini, Managing Attorney, MV Kini Law Firm.
“There is no legal obligation for SBI to fund (Jet) as a banker. The court cannot state it on the fundamental rights of the people to get funds because it is a private airline. If it was a government entity, there was still a possibility they could have done it,” said Ravi Singhania, Managing Partner, Singhania and Partners.
“SBI, too, has a lot of stakeholders to answer to. What the court can do is ask the two parties to come to a settlement. However, it cannot pass an order on the same,” Singhania added.

116,2019-05-07,State Bank,"Introduction of new pension scheme in SBI has ‘no legal effect’, rules Kerala High Court


You are eligible for pension only after 10 years of service istock/JoyImage JoyImage




You are eligible for pension only after 10 years of service istock/JoyImage JoyImage




 The High Court of Kerala has declared that the introduction of Defined Contributory Pension Scheme/New Pension Scheme (NPS) in State Bank of India ‘has no legal effect’.
State Banks’ Staff Union (SBSU), Kerala Circle, had argued in a petition that the introduction of the scheme for members joining service on or after August 1, 2010, took away the right to get pension based on the pension rule in vogue in SBI. 
Giving a brief history, A Raghavan, General Secretary, SBSU (Kerala circle), said that the ninth bipartite settlement had made the NPS applicable across the industry, excluding SBI. 
Despite provisions to exclude the bank as per the settlement, the management had unilaterally gone head to implement the NPS from August 1, 2010.
Appearing on behalf of the petitioners, counsel S Vaidyanathan and H Ganapathy contended that the SBI Act, 1955, does not empower its Central Board to amend the pension rules without due process of law. 
Neither could this be done with retrospective effect, they said. An amendment can be brought in only in terms of the various provisions under Section 50 of the Act. 
But Section 50(4) clearly states that every regulation shall, as soon as it is made by the Central Board, be forwarded to the Centre, and lay a copy before each House of Parliament in session for a period of 30 days. 
Both Houses must agree on making any modification in the regulation before implementation. Thereafter, it should be notified in the gazette.
Delivering the judgement, Justice CT Ravikumar alluded to similar petitions filed earlier also contending that the introduction of NPS was ‘bad in law’, owing to non-compliance with the mandatory provisions under Section 50. 
Even if the bank was only implementing the policy of the Centre, it could not overlook the statutory mandate under Section 50 in respect of service conditions related to pension. 
Judgment in that case had observed that the NPS would have to be introduced as a regulation, as contemplated under Section 50, and will have to follow the procedure under Section 50(4) to have a legal effect. 
Justice Ravikumar observed that “going by that judgment, the NPS (has) got no legal effect. In such circumstances, I am of the view that the NPS is not now available for consideration”."
113,2019-05-10,State Bank,"SBI reduces MCLR by 5 basis points 
State Bank of India (SBI) has reduced its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points across all tenors with effect from May 10. 
With this move, SBI has cut its MCLR twice by 5 bps each after the Reserve Bank of India cut its policy repo rate by 25 basis points, from 6.25 per cent to 6 per cent, in early April. 
Following the MCLR cut, SBI’s benchmark one-year MCLR has come down from 8.50 per cent to 8.45 per cent. “As a result, interest rates on all loans linked to the MCLR stand reduced by 5 bps.This is the second rate-cut in one month. After the April monetary policy review, the MCLR was reduced by 5 bps,” SBI said in a statement. With today’s MCLR cut, the reduction in the home loan rates since April 10 till date is 15 bps."
112,2019-05-10,State Bank,"SBI sold electoral bonds worth Rs 3,622 cr in March, April: RTI 
State Bank of India has sold electoral bonds worth over Rs 3,622 crore in March and April this year, an RTI response has said.
In a response provided to Pune-based Vihar Durve, SBI said electoral bonds of Rs 1,365.69 crore were sold in March, which shot up by 65.21 per cent in April to Rs 2,256.37 crore.
In April, most electoral bonds were sold in Mumbai at Rs 694 crore, followed by Rs 417.31 crore in Kolkata, Rs 408.62 crore in New Delhi and Rs 338.07 crore in Hyderabad, among other cities, it said.
The bonds’ sale opens in SBI branches when the Finance Ministry issues a notification of their sale for a given period.
The scheme of electoral bonds notified by the Centre in 2018 has been challenged in the Supreme Court. 
Only political parties registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (43 of 1951) and which secured not less than one per cent of the votes polled in the last general election to the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly of the State, shall be eligible to receive the bonds.
The bonds may be purchased by a person who is a citizen of India “or incorporated or established in India,” the government had said in a statement last year.
The bonds remain valid for 15 days and can be encashed by an eligible political party through an account with the authorised bank within that period only.
A voluntary group working in the field of electoral reforms, Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), has demanded a stay on the sale, while the CPI(M) has challenged it before the Supreme Court in separate petitions.
ADR recently filed an application in the apex court seeking a stay on the Electoral Bond Scheme, 2018, which was notified by the Centre in January last year.
It said amendments carried out in relevant Acts have “opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate donations to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies, which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy”."

State Bank of India misses the Q4 profit estimates.
   -  Bloomberg


State Bank of India on Friday said its balance sheet has been fully repaired in FY2019 even as it recorded a turnaround performance in the fourth quarter.
The country’s largest bank reported a net profit of ₹838 crore against a net loss of ₹7,718 crore in the same period the previous year. It reported a substantial improvement in the asset quality, with lower fresh slippages and better recoveries. The profit in the reporting quarter came on the back of a 15 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) increase in the net interest income (the difference between interest earned and interest expended) at ₹22,954 crore and lower loan-loss provisions of ₹17,336 crore (down 28 per cent Y-o-Y).
For the full-year ended March, the bank reported a net profit of ₹862 crore against a net loss of ₹6,547 crore in FY18.
Fee income, including loan processing charges, commission on government business, letter of credit, bank guarantee and remittance and collection, was up 2 per cent Y-o-Y at ₹8,589 crore in the just ended quarter. .
During the quarter, fresh slippages were almost 78 per cent lower Y-o-Y at ₹7,505 crore. The bank reported a net decline of ₹15,015 crore in gross non-performing assets (NPAs) against a net increase of ₹24,286 crore in the year-ago period. Recovery, including upgradation, soared to ₹5,712 crore (₹85 crore in the year-ago quarter).
Highlighting the decline in gross and net NPAs and the substantial improvement in the provision coverage ratio, Chairman Rajnish Kumar said: “This shows that the balance sheet of the bank has been fully repaired. Going forward, the impact of the shadow of the past will not be there on the earnings of the bank.”
Gross NPAs declined from 10.91 per cent of gross advances as at end-March 2018 to 7.53 per cent as at end-March 2019 and the net NPAs fell from 5.73 per cent of net advances to 3.01 per cent. The PCR improved from 66 per cent to 79 per cent. The bank said recovery in FY19 was at an all-time high of ₹31,512 crore. Of this, ₹13,836 crore came through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Resolution process.
Kumar emphasised that “...In the case of all the three major accounts — Essar Steel, Alok Industries and Bhushan Power and Steel which are in very advanced stage of resolution — we have made 100 per cent provision. And, as a result, almost ₹16,000 crore is what is recoverable as soon as the judicial process is over. This shows the strength of the balance sheet as we speak.”"

State Bank of India (SBI) said on Friday that it has received two unsolicited bids for ailing Jet Airways, nearly a month after the airline was forced to ground all operations due to funding troubles.
Jet, once India's largest private airline, stopped all flights on April 17 after its lenders, led by SBI, declined to extend more funds to keep the carrier going.
“(We have) made disproportionate efforts to keep Jet flying,” the bank's chairman Rajnish Kumar told reporters in Mumbai."
111,2019-05-12,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide
Resistance may cap upside in SBI
SBI (₹308.05)










SBI tumbled over 5 per cent intra-week, breaking below the key support level of ₹302. However, it clawed back from the low of ₹292.2, recovering almost all the loss after the fourth-quarter results announcement on Friday. Though the weekly candle gives a mixed signal, the daily chart is relatively positive. A key support is at ₹302, which can limit the downside; resistance is at ₹313. A strong break above it can take the stock higher to ₹321-322. A pull-back from ₹322 can trigger a corrective fall to ₹312. But a strong break above ₹322 will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to ₹330-335. Given the weakness in the broader markets, such a strong rally looks less probable. So the upside is likely to be limited to ₹322 at the moment. On the other hand, if SBI fails to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹313, a fall to ₹302 or even ₹297 is possible. As such, the impact of Friday's results will be short-lived and the overall negative sentiment in the market could weigh on the stock. In that case, SBI can fall to ₹ 290 and ₹287.
Uptrend in ITC under threat
ITC (₹297.7)










ITC moved up in the initial part of the week but failed to sustain higher. The uptrend that has been in place since late February seems to be under threat. A key support is at ₹295 which is likely to be tested in the near term. The stock has to hold above this support in order to keep the sentiment positive. A break below ₹295 can drag the stock initially lower to ₹288-287. A further break below ₹287 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹280-278. Such a fall to ₹280-278 will be a good buying opportunity from a long-term perspective. Investors with a long-term perspective can take long positions at ₹285 and accumulate at ₹282 and ₹278. On the other hand, if ITC manages to sustain above ₹295 in the coming days, a bounce to ₹302 — the crucial 21-day moving average resistance — is possible. The stock has to surpass this hurdle to bring back the bullish momentum. Else, a pull-back to ₹295 is possible again. In that case, ITC can remain range-bound between ₹295 and ₹302 for some time.
Infosys can witness a fresh fall
Infosys (₹716.05)










Infosys has crucial supports in the ₹706-703 region, which can be tested in the near term. It’s ability to sustain above this support zone will decide its next move. A bounce from the ₹706-703 support region will ease the downside pressure. It will increase the possibility of the stock moving higher to ₹730-735 in the short term. It will also keep the broader ₹700-775 sideways range intact. Infosys has been trading in this range since mid-January. But if the stock breaks below ₹703 in the coming days, it will come under renewed pressure. Such a break will take the stock initially lower to ₹690-685. A further break below ₹685 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹670-665 on profit-booking. Indicators on the chart favour a decline below ₹703 and a fall to ₹670-665 in the coming weeks. However, the region between ₹670 and ₹665 is a crucial long-term support, which may halt the fall. A decisive bounce from the ₹670-665 support zone could be a good buying opportunity from a long-term perspective.
Outlook turns bearish for RIL
RIL (₹1,250.5)










Contrary to an expectation of a rise, RIL tumbled 11 per cent last week. Morgan Stanley, a global brokerage firm, downgrading the stock seems to have made investors book profits, triggering this sharp sell-off. The uptrend that has been in place since October 2018 has reversed, and the outlook has turned bearish. Though there is some support near the current levels, the broader picture is negative. So, any bounce from the current levels may be short-lived and could be restricted to ₹1,300-1,320. A further fall to ₹1,200-1,180 is possible in the coming days. The region around ₹1,180 is a strong long-term trend support which can halt the fall. A bounce from there will be bullish from a long-term perspective. Investors can start buying RIL at ₹1,200 and also accumulate at ₹1,285 and ₹1,295. However, the possibility of a prolonged sideways move between ₹1,180 and ₹1,300 cannot be ruled out after this fall. As such, the rally to fresh highs thereafter might take time. So, investors buying around ₹1,200 will need to be patient and hold the stock for a long period of time.
Down-move to extend in Tata Steel
Tata Steel (₹487.3)










Tata Steel tumbled 11 per cent last week. Reports that the company’s joint venture with German steel maker Thyssenkrupp may not go through was a major trigger for the sell-off in the stock last week. The resistance at ₹560 has held well. It also keeps intact the downtrend that has been in place since January 2018. A strong resistance is in the ₹505-510 region which can cap the upside. A rally beyond ₹510 looks unlikely now. Also, an intermediate bounce to this resistance zone is likely to find fresh sellers coming into the market. A fall to ₹455-450 or even ₹440 is likely in the coming days. A further break below ₹440 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹425 or even ₹400. Traders with a short-term perspective can make use of rallies to go short at ₹498 and ₹505. Stop-loss can be placed at ₹522 for the target of ₹455. Revise the stop-loss lower to ₹490 as soon as the stock moves down to ₹475.

With the top management of Jet Airways resigning en masse, State Bank of India, the lead lender to the airline, may seek put in place a court-appointed receiver to manage the affairs of the debt-ridden company.
“As bankers do not have the capability to run the airline, there has been a request to appoint a receiver. For this, the lenders will have to approach the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) or the High Court. SBI may come up with a list of two or three aviation experts to be appointed as a receiver, who will look after the interests of the airline,” said a banking industry source.
Earlier this week, Jet Airways CEO Vinay Dube, CFO Amit Agarwal, Company Secretary and Compliance Officer Kuldeep Sharma and Chief People Officer Rajhul Taneja quit the company, citing personal reasons. Whole-time director Gaurang Shetty has also resigned.
The airline temporarily shut operations on April 18. It is estimated that ₹8,000 crore will be needed to resurrect the airline, whose total debt stands at over ₹14,000 crore.
Another banking source said the lenders have to ensure day-to-day issues — including engaging with employee unions — are being taken care of.
“The new manager will have to be given legal backing to function effectively; hence, court approval would be needed. Even if the airline is not operational, the company needs to be preserved during the hibernation period,” said the source."

In the backdrop of the current slowdown, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to cut the policy repo rate by 35-50 basis points (bps) in the forthcoming monetary policy review, according to the bank’s ‘Ecowrap’ report. 
The economic research department of the State Bank of India (SBI) expects gross domestic product (GDP) growth for Q4 (January-March) FY19 at 6.1 per cent. Gross value added (GVA) growth could be at six per cent, or slip marginally below 6 per cent at 5.9 per cent. FY19 GDP growth will be at 6.9 per cent. 
“The good thing is that we expect that the current slowdown could be transitory if proper policies are adopted in interregnum. For example, the current high real interest rates are severely acting as an impediment to investment.
“We are thus penciling a larger rate cut (35-50 bps) by the RBI in the forthcoming policy,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI.
Interestingly, the report said the RBI, for the first time, could use the rate change in non-multiples of 25 bps as a first step towards providing second-generation signals to the market of future policy stance. However, even such larger rate-cuts will not help fully, but its transmission will, it added. 
To this end, the RBI should now ensure that asset and liability sides of banks move in tandem and ensure repo rate is directly benchmarked to external benchmark/non-volatile bank liabilities/ current account, savings account (CASA) that are mostly used for transaction purposes. 
Otherwise, the report said, the financial system would continue to be constrained by lack of transmission, even as the RBI continues to cut rates."

With three years of net profits and two years of underwriting profits, Pushan Mahapatra, Managing Director and CEO, SBI General Insurance, says the private sector insurer is focussed both on topline and bottomline growth. In an interview with BusinessLine, he says that there will be more clarity soon on an IPO and State Bank of India will take a call. He also outlined the insurer’s plans on online sales and various partnerships in the space. Excerpts:
What about plans for listing on the bourses?
We are in the risk business, so it does require a lot of capital. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has been talking about companies going in for IPOs after they have stabilised their operations. There are other positives as well such as better governance, better transparency, and therefore, better discipline on business. 
Today, in line with listing guidelines, we will be able to hit the market — with three years of net profits and two years of underwriting positive results as well as bright future prospects. It will be discussed and finalised and will get some clarity over the next couple of months. Since State Bank of India is the major promoter, they will have to take a call.
Natural calamities have become a recurrent feature. How are general insurers impacted? 
In the case of cyclone Fani, we have got more than 1,000 claims. Total losses, as of now, are at ₹80 crore. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of loss but ultimate insurance loss is very low. It is the same in every catastrophic natural calamity. Only when insurance losses and economic losses come closer, it is actually a mature market. With natural calamities, people think it won’t happen to them or it won’t happen a second time. But in Chennai, there were back to back floods. So when we make projections for loss ratios, we always factor in two natural calamity events because that has become the order of the day.
How are insurers dealing with the spate of downgrades in NBFCs?
NBFCs have become a major part of the ecosystem. Somewhere regulations have to be like the way they are for banks. Insurers have to make provisions for downgraded NBFCs. For exit, you need to have a market, that’s not there. So you make provisions.
IRDAI is working on a standardised health cover with few exclusions. How will it impact pricing?
These features have to come in if we want to increase insurance penetration and acceptability. Products have to be easy to understand, administer and create value. We have seen that with our own products as well. Unlike most other financial products, general insurance products are more complicated with too many exclusions, limits and sub limits. We must convert the terms and conditions to a language which we can understand easily.
Are you looking to expand the distribution network?
Our big focus is online and we want it to become a credible distribution channel in the next three years. We are making considerable investments in technology, people, and processes. At present, online is very small. People still research online and buy offline but we are trying to change that. Digital partnerships also take time to scale up and mature. We are looking at a large number of digital tie-ups — wallets, e-commerce industry and new payment systems."
103,2019-06-07,State Bank,"SBI introduces repo-linked home loan product
 State Bank of India on Friday said it will introduce a repo rate-linked home loan product from July 1.
PK Gupta, Managing Director, SBI, said home loans under this product will be priced at 2.65 per cent over the repo rate of 5.75 per cent. So, the home loan interest rate will work out to 8.40 per cent.
Currently, India’s largest bank offers home loans, which are linked to its marginal cost of funds, at 8.55 per cent.
Following the Reserve Bank of India cutting its repo rate from 6 per cent to 5.75 per cent, SBI said the benefit of this cut will be passed in its entirety to cash credit /overdraft customers (limits above ₹1 lakh) banking with the bank with effect from July 1.

102,2019-06-13,State Bank,"How a delay in software updation proved costly for SBI’s customers 


While technology is expected to make life easy, a delay in software updation for incorporating the latest changes can cost a bomb for the needy, besides complicating the process.
State Bank of India (SBI), it appears, has not given effect to some provisions in the Finance Bill 2019 related to deduction of tax at source.
Taking note of the discrepancy on the issue of deduction of tax at source, the Coimbatore Consumer Cause (CCC) has, in a communication to the Chairman of SBI, pointed out that many people, particularly pensioners, were forced to file their tax returns to claim the refund. And in the process, they had to shell out as much as ₹1,000 as service charges to tax practitioners/auditors. “A number of pensioners do not file their I-T returns, as the total income is well below the taxable limit. The levy of tax is a loss to such individuals and this is totally unacceptable,” argued K Kathirmathiyon, Secretary, CCC, before adding that “there was enough time for the bank to update its software to effect the provisions of the Finance Bill 2019. Yet, nothing has been done to bring the latest provisions into force.” 
It was specifically stipulated that the Bill would come into force from April 1. For fiscal 2019-20, the standard deduction for salaried class was increased from ₹40,000 to ₹50,000, and the Income-Tax limit for pensioners to ₹5 lakh.
A cross-section of SBI pensioners said that the tax was being deducted for income above ₹3 lakh."

SBI (₹343.8)
SBI was stuck in a narrow range between ₹339 and ₹349 last week. The near-term outlook is mixed. SBI can trade sideways between the significant support at ₹335 and resistance at ₹350 for some time. Within this range, there is a strong likelihood of the stock falling to ₹335 — the lower end of the range in the early part of this week. A breakout on either side of ₹335 or ₹350 will decide the direction of the next move. A break below ₹335 can take SBI lower to ₹325 and ₹320. As being reiterated over the last couple of weeks, the region around ₹320 is a strong long-term resistance-turned-support, which can limit the downside. Fresh buyers are likely to emerge around this level. As such, a fall to ₹325-₹320 will be a good buying opportunity from a medium-term perspective. On the other hand, if SBI breaks above ₹350, it can move up to the next crucial resistance level of ₹362. SBI has to rise past ₹362 decisively to gain fresh bullish momentum. Targets above ₹362 are ₹390 and ₹400.










ITC (₹277.9)
 ITC has been managing to sustain above the crucial long-term support level of ₹275. However, the stock is not gaining strength for a strong rally. This indicates lack of fresh buying interest in the stock. ITC has to break above ₹282 to get a breather. Such a break can take it up towards ₹287 and ₹290. Only a strong rise past ₹290 will confirm the trend reversal, which will then pave way for the next targets of ₹300 and ₹310. But such a strong upmove looks unlikely at the moment. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average and is now on the verge of crossing below the 100-day moving average. This is a negative signal, indicating that the upside could be limited. It also keeps the possibilities open of the stock breaking below `275. As such, if ITC breaks below ₹275, the downside pressure will increase. In such a scenario, the current downtrend will remain intact and the stock can extend the fall to ₹265 and ₹260 thereafter. 










Infosys (₹740.4)
 Infosys moved up last week as expected, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹758.9 and reversed sharply lower, giving back almost all the gains. The resistance at ₹755 has held well. Key near-term supports are at ₹734 (21-week moving average) and ₹730 (21-day moving average), which are likely to limit the downside. A break and fall below ₹730 looks less probable now. As long as the stock trades above ₹730, the outlook will remain positive. An upward reversal from the ₹734-₹730 support zone can take the stock higher to ₹755 again. An eventual break above ₹755 will then take Infosys up to ₹770 and ₹775 — the upper end of the ₹695-₹775 sideways range. The stock has been stuck in this broad sideways range since mid-January this year. If it manages to rise past ₹775, it can gain fresh momentum and target ₹790 and ₹800. But a pull-back from ₹775 will keep the sideways range intact. In such a scenario, Infosys can fall-back initially to ₹760-₹750 and even lower thereafter. 










RIL (₹1,316.95)
RIL managed to sustain above ₹1,300 but is not gaining strength to move higher. The price action over the last few weeks increases the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,300. Inability to rise past ₹1,338 (55-day moving average) and a subsequent fall last week, strengthens the case for a fall below ₹1,300. RIL will come under renewed pressure on a break below ₹1,300 and can move lower to ₹1,280-1,275. This move could be sharp and swift. A further break below 1,275 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to 1,250 and even 1,220 over the medium term. On the other hand, if RIL manages to sustain above 1,300, a bounce to 1,338 is possible again. A break above 1,338 will then increase the possibility of the upmove extending to 1,350 and 1,360. The region between 1,360 and 1,365 is a crucial resistance. RIL has to rise past 1,365 to gain fresh momentum and target 1,400 and 1,430. But such a strong upmove looks unlikely at the moment. 










Tata Steel (₹501.4)
 Contrary to our expectation of a fall, Tata Steel surged last week. The stock was up 4 per cent. Support for the stock is in the ₹490-488 region. As long as the stock trades above this support zone, the near-term outlook will remain positive. A rise to ₹515-520 is likely. The region around 520 is a crucial long-term trend resistance. As such, Tata Steel has to rise past ₹520 decisively to turn the outlook bullish and also to signal a trend reversal. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹527-530. A further break above ₹530 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its upmove to ₹560 over the medium term. Inability to breach ₹520 can trigger a pull-back move to ₹500 and ₹490. A break below ₹490 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its fall to ₹460. In such a scenario, Tata Steel can trade in a sideways range between ₹460 and ₹520.

99,2019-06-21,State Bank,"To boost profitability, SBI creates new group to focus on credit-light sectors 
State Bank of India (SBI) has formed a separate group within its Corporate Accounts Group (CAG) to cater to the non-fund-based requirements of clients in credit-light sectors such as pharmaceuticals, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and information technology (IT). This is aimed at boosting its non-interest income.
The credit-light group (CLG) will focus on generating non-interest income comprising letter of credit/bank guarantee commission, cash management charges, exchange income from forex activities, cross-selling commission, remittances, and collections, among others. It is also responsible for garnering low-cost deposits.
The focus on non-interest income is with a view to improve the profitability of India’s largest bank without having to allocate capital. 
In line with the changing banking landscape, SBI has remodelled its corporate banking structure and credit dispensation process, according to the bank’s latest annual report.
Consequently, the CAG now handles top-rated business groups, while other corporate accounts are handled by the commercial clients’ group (CCG) vertical. 
In addition to credit relationships, the bank, according to the report, is focussing on credit-light sectors.
Further, a specialised group, Financial and Institutional Group (FIG), to address credit and transactional banking needs of insurance companies, broking firms, banks (private and foreign), and mutual funds has also been created within the CAG. 
“Both the newly created groups – CLG and FIG – have taken off, and have started contributing to the bank’s business growth,” the bank said.
The report underscored that the core objectives of the revamp of the corporate banking structure and credit dispensation process were to strengthen credit risk management function, leverage analytics, make a paradigm shift of focus in business from ‘fund to fee’ and ‘originate to distribute’to improve the bank’s overall wallet share in the corporate banking business.
Furthermore, the CAG aims to leverage its corporate relationships to improve the value of relationships by increasing the penetration of fund-based, non-fund-based, and fee-based non-credit products. 
As of March-end 2019, total outstanding loans to clients in CAG stood at ₹4,06,645 crore and ₹1,75,185 crore with respect to non-fund based products. 
Domestic advances in CCG at the end of FY2019 was at ₹4,00,766 crore."

SBI (₹349.45)
SBI fell about 3 per cent in the initial part of the week. However, the stock managed to claw-back from the low of ₹333.75, recovering all the loss and closed 1.6 per cent higher for the week. An immediate resistance is at ₹352 for the stock which can be tested in the near future. A strong rise past this hurdle will take the stock higher to the next crucial resistance level of ₹362. 










As mentioned last week, SBI has to breach ₹362 decisively to gain fresh bullish momentum and target ₹390 and ₹400. But a pull-back from ₹362 can drag SBI lower to ₹350 again. In such a scenario, the stock can remain range-bound between ₹335 and ₹362 for some more time. On the other hand, if SBI fails to surpass the immediate resistance level of ₹352, it can fall to ₹335 again. In that case, SBI can trade between ₹335 and ₹352 for some time. The stock will come under pressure if it declines below ₹335 levels. Such a break can take the stock lower to ₹325-320. The region around ₹320 is a strong long-term support and a further fall below it is unlikely.
 
ITC (₹274.2)
ITC continued to trade lower and has declined below ₹275 as expected. The stock was down 1.3 per cent last week. The outlook is bearish. Strong resistance is in the ₹280-282 region, which has been capping the upside over the last few weeks. Intermediate support is at ₹272.5. If this support holds, a range-bound move between ₹272.5 and ₹282 is possible for some time. 










However, the bias will continue to remain negative as the indicators on the charts are negative. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 100-day moving average as expected. This indicates that the downtrend is intact and the upside could be limited. An eventual break below ₹272.5 will bring renewed pressure on the stock. Such a break below will increase the likelihood of it tumbling towards ₹265 and ₹260. The levels of ₹262 and ₹257 are crucial long-term supports. The current downtrend is likely to find a bottom around these levels. A strong bounce from these supports will mark the beginning of a long-term uptrend in this stock.
 
Infosys (₹750.7)
Infosys has been stuck inbetween its support at ₹735 and resistance at ₹759 over the last couple of weeks. Within this range, the stock fell to ₹735 and bounced sharply from there to close 1.4 per cent higher last week. The 21-week moving average support level of ₹735 has held very well as expected and keeps the bullish view intact. 
 










The immediate resistance level of ₹759 is likely to be tested in the near term. The bias on the chart is positive. The 21-day moving average has crossed over the 55-day moving average. This is a bullish signal, which indicates that Infosys is likely to breach ₹759 and rise to ₹770 and ₹775 again. Inability to break above ₹775 can drag the stock lower to ₹755 and ₹750 again. Such a pull-back move will keep the broader ₹695-775 sideways range intact. The stock has been stuck in this range for a prolonged period of time since mid-January this year. On the other hand, if Infosys manages to surpass ₹775 decisively, it will gain fresh momentum and target ₹795 and ₹800 thereafter.
 
RIL (₹1,279.2)
As expected, RIL declined below the psychological level of ₹1,300. The stock was down about 3 per cent last week and closed decisively below the 21-week moving average level of ₹1,309. The level of ₹1,300 will now act as a strong support-turned-resistance and cap the upside. As long as the stock trades below ₹1,300, the outlook will remain negative. RIL has to rise past ₹1,300 decisively to negate the bearish view and rise to ₹1,320 and ₹1,350 levels again. 










But such a strong up-move looks unlikely now. As such, a fall to ₹1,240 can be seen in the near term. If the RIL stock manages to bounce from ₹1,240, a relief rally to ₹1,300 is possible. But a break below ₹1,240 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹1,220 and ₹1,200. The region between ₹1,220 and ₹1,200 is a strong long-term support for the stock. A further fall below ₹1,200 looks unlikely as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at those levels. A strong bounce from ₹1,200 may indicate the beginning of a fresh leg of a long-term uptrend for the stock.
 
Tata Steel (₹497.75)
Tata Steel tumbled over 7 per cent intraweek, but managed to bounce-back, recovering almost all the loss. The near-term outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹492 and resistance at ₹506. A breakout on either side of ₹492 or ₹506 will decide the direction of the next move. 










A break above ₹506 will ease the downside pressure. Such a break will take the stock higher to ₹515 and ₹520. The region around ₹520 is a crucial long-term resistance, which has to be breached decisively to turn the outlook bullish. A break above ₹520 can take Tata Steel up to ₹530. But if the stock breaks below ₹492, it can fall initially to ₹475. A further break below ₹475 will then increase the likelihood of the stock revisiting ₹465-460 levels. Tata Steel can trade in a wide range of ₹460-520 in the coming weeks. A breakout on either side of ₹460 or ₹520 will set the direction of the next move.

London-based Adi Group and the Jet Airways Employees Union are to bid for acquiring a 75 per cent stake in the airline, it was announced on Friday.
“We want to be co-owners with employees in perpetuity. We have informed the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) through the Resolution Professional that the Adi Group and the employees consortium combined a few days back. Both parties met them separately so that there was a certain independence to it. Capital is not an issue for us,” Sanjay Vishwanath, Chairman of Adi Group, said at a press conference on Friday.
But the move has already run into rough weather as the National Aviators Guild (NAG) saying that is a registered trade union representing the pilots of Jet Airways adding that “We are not associated with the press conference — or aware of what announcement is to be made,” in a statement. The organisers of the press conference denied this claiming that all employees were behind the move.
Vishwanath was of the view that anything between ₹2,500 crore and ₹5,000 crore would be required for the airline to restart operations. He added that there were broadly four groups to whom money was owed — the Indian lender group, the foreign institution lender group, operational creditors and employees.
“We think the Indian lender group is owed about ₹8,500 crore, the foreign institutional lenders are owed about ₹4,000 crore, for operational creditors we have heard that the amount is anything from ₹8,000 crore to ₹12,000 crore. We do not know what the number is and that is where we need clarity. Roughly about ₹600-700 crore is owed to employees so in all we are talking about ₹25,000-26,000 crore,” Vishwanath said.

96,2019-06-29,State Bank,"SBI targets Rs 20,000 cr home loan disbursal in Karnataka
 State Bank of India (SBI) is planning to has disburse home loans to the extent of Rs 20,000 crore this financial year (2019-20) in Karnataka (which includes Bengaluru) market. 
“We are hopeful of achieving our set target of Rs 20,000,” Abhijit Majumder, Chief General Manager-Karnataka, SBI told Business Line on the sidelines of SBI Home Loan Utsav.
“Among the home loan disbursals, it is the mid-size segment ie up to Rs 50 lakhs which has been the bulk. This year we are planning to target affordable housing in a big way,” he added.
The bank last year had disbursed Rs 15,000 crore.
Housing loans are witnessing a steady growth for the bank in Bengaluru with IT sector and builder relationship being the driving force. “With the introduction of RERA and GST it is providing the regulatory checks and balances,” Majumder said.
Majumder said “It is estimated that monthly 50 per cent of Bengaluru market home loan buyers are under 35 years and it is here SBI has emerged as the leader.”
The bank has started offering home loan linked to Repo Rate. After the linkage of loans to Repo Rate, consumers have the option to take loans pegged to the Central Bank repo rate with a longer tenure.
“Even existing borrowers will have the option to change their rate at a marginal cost, with a switch over fee of 0.25 per cent of loan outstanding,” said Majumder.
Now with the advent of PMAY scheme, many developers setting aside a portion of their portfolio for affordable housing.
“Launch of multiple affordable housing projects is reducing the ticket size resulting in an increase in the purchase and SBI is holding to a major market share of the housing loan demand in Bengaluru alone,” he explained.
To target PMAY scheme, the bank has come out with products like ‘SBI Max Gain’ - the loan is sanctioned as an overdraft with added flexibility to operate the home loan account like SB or Current Account. ‘SBI Privilege’ and ‘Shaurya’ - Privilege offers a home loan product that is tailor made to the requirements of employees of Central/State governments while Shaurya is for defence personnel. The ‘Top Up Loan’ - Upto two home equity loans are allowed to exist together and there is no pre-payment/ pre-closure penalty.
Earlier, the two-day SBI Home Loan Utsav was inaugurated by Abhijit Majumder, Chief General Manager-Karnataka, SBI and General Managers Vincent M Devassy, S Muralidharan and Manju S Bolakani.
At the Utsav, the bank is offering 0.15 per cent concession on interest rate, 100 per cent waiver of processing charges and no legal/valuation fee in respect of all proposals sourced during the expo.
About 40 leading property developers are participating at the two-day SBI Home Loan Utsav."

State Bank of India misses the Q4 profit estimates.
   -  Bloomberg




State Bank of India (SBI) and National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) on Monday inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to boost the availability of capital for infrastructure projects. 
The scope of the MoU includes equity investments, project funding, bond financing, renewable energy support and take-out finance for operating assets, according to the joint statement issued by SBI and NIIF. 
The objective of this initiative is to aid in filling the gap at a time when the availability of equity and debt financing for infrastructure has moderated, it added. 
Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI, said the bank and NIIF have joined hands to provide a suite of financing solutions to the infrastructure sector. The initiative will address concerns relating to the availability of equity and long-term debt funding options to large scale projects, thereby stimulating the infrastructure development.
Sujoy Bose, Managing Director and CEO, NIIF, said the availability of post-construction take-out equity and debt financing for developers and builders of infrastructure projects will play an important role in the infrastructure development cycle in India. NIIF’s partnership with SBI will allow us to design large-scale, long-term financing solutions to address this need,” he said.
In addition to focusing on take-out financing, including through the IDF (Infrastructure Development Fund) route, the partnership will also explore new avenues of financing renewable energy projects.
During the last financial year, SBI — through its specialised Project Finance & Structuring Business Unit — extended financial assistance of about ₹51,000 crore to 47 infrastructure projects and for the current financial year the bank has a robust pipeline."
93,2019-07-02,State Bank,"PSBs need ₹50,000-crore growth capital this fiscal: SBI report


Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Economic Advisor, SBI




Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Economic Advisor, SBI


 Public sector banks (PSBs) may require around ₹50,000-crore growth capital in FY2020, according to State Bank of India’s special research report on budget for ANM (agriculture, NBFC and MSME) and ‘measured’ fiscal consolidation. Measures in respect of some lapses in NBFC sector are required to send a strong message, it added.
“Assuming a 12-13 per cent credit growth in FY20 with credit risk weighted assets of 70 per cent, PSBs may be requiring around ₹50,000 crore growth capital in FY20. However, the same also depends upon some major variables i.e. alternate long-term investor, recoveries from NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal), investment environment, out of NCLT settlements/auctions, treasury gains/loss, MTM (mark-to-market) provisioning of investments, additional or provision write-back,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI. 
Under recapitalisation, over the last three financial years, PSBs have been recapitalised to the extent of ₹2.87 lakh crore, with infusion of ₹2.20 lakh crore by the Government and mobilisation of over ₹66,000 crore by PSBs themselves.
“At present, the share of top five banks in credit is around 39 per cent (China: 47 per cent). Thus, continued banking consolidation will improve the banks’ ability to lend for developmental needs. There is also an immediate need to augment the number of NCLT benches so that the resolution system does not get choked. HR reforms for PSBs must also be a priority for the new Government,” the report said.
Emphasising that measures in respect of some lapses in NBFC sector are required to send a strong message, the report said this is all the more urgent since if the NBFC sector health does not improve, banks will have to face fresh round of NPA (non-performing asset) provisions going forward.
The report assessed that till March 2020, ₹4.75 lakh crore of bonds and papers of NBFC sector are set to mature. Further, most of the NBFC exposure is to the realty sector. 
In this context, the report suggested that some sort of demand boost for the reality sector, like GST concessions to buyers and stamp duty rationalisation could very well give a flip to the realty sector and can also help solve part of the NBFC quagmire that they are currently in.
The Budget could focus upon tweaking with the agricultural sector. A big push to the term loan will boost the agricultural sector, the research report said.
Further, setting up of an Agri-marketing Reforms Council (AMRC) on the lines of the GST Çouncil and an exclusive focus on harnessing the rapidly shrinking water resources also deserve higher priority.
The MSME sector, too, needs urgent focus. Here, the SBI report underscored that there is a need for amalgamation of CGTMSE (Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises) and CGFMU (Credit Guarantee Fund for Micro Units).
“This will remove the complexities such as multiple coverage / non-coverage of MSME loans and understanding among field functionaries about various time norms to be adhered to under each guarantee scheme will be eliminated. Setting up of an Equity Fund on the lines of the Sinha Committee suggestions may also be crystallised,” the report said.
Overall, for the next Budget exercise, the report said the development goal might supersede the rigid objective of ’fiscal austerity’. Given the growth slowdown, the Government should ideally keep the deficit numbers constant for the next two years before reducing it further and try to propel growth. 
“Sticking to a particular fiscal number is not that important in the current scenario. Instead, emphasis should be on making country-mandated fiscal rules that are credible and achievable. For an economy like India, higher public borrowings are a necessary evil given the large welfare schemes of the Government,” elaborated the report. 
SBI estimates suggest that there is a 40 per cent probability of fiscal deficit for FY20 being at 3.5 per cent to 3.6 per cent . The market will actually be happy with such numbers given the weak growth impulses."
92,2019-07-08,State Bank,"SBI to remove IMPS charges on internet banking from August 1
State Bank of India has decided to do away with the charges on IMPS (Immediate Payment Service) transactions on internet banking (INB)/ mobile banking service (MBS) with effect from August 1, 2019.
IMPS provides a robust and real time fund transfer facility, offering an instant, 24X7, interbank electronic fund transfer service that could be accessed on multiple channels like Mobile, Internet, ATM, SMS, Branch and USSD(*99#). IMPS is an emphatic service which allows transfer of funds instantly within banks across India.
While it will offer IMPS free of charge on INB/MBS, India's largest bank has revised the same on IMPS transactions at branches. The charges on the first two IMPS slabs at branches remain unchanged -- nil for the up to Rs 1,000 slab and Rs 2 + GST (goods and service tax) for the Rs 1,001 up to Rs 10,000 slab.
The charges on the remaining three slabs have been revised -- to Rs 4 + GST (Rs 2 + GST now) on the Rs 10,001 up to Rs 25,000 slab; to Rs 4 + GST (Rs 5 + GST) on the Rs 25,001 up to Rs 1 lakh slab; and to Rs 12 + GST (Rs 10 + GST) on the Rs 1,00,001 up to Rs 2 lakh slab. The IMPS facility is provided by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) through its existing National Financial System (NFS) switch.
As at March-end 2019, the share of transactions through alternate channels including Internet & Mobile Banking, POS & e-Commerce, ATM/ and UPI & YONO, for SBI was 88.1 per cent against 84.1 per cent as at March-end 2018."

The country’s largest lender said it will also waive off immediate payment service (IMPS) charges for these services from August 1.
Waiving off the aforementioned charges is aimed at giving a boost to the movement of digital funds, the bank said in a statement. Along with customer convenience, the waiver in NEFT, IMPS and RTGS charges will attract more customers to digital transactions, it added.
As on March 31, the number of SBI customers using internet banking are more than 6 crores and mobile banking services stands at 1.41 crore.
Additionally, the bank has already reduced NEFT and RTGS charges for customers transacting through their branch network by 20 per cent across all slabs.

“This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers vested in RBI under.... the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers,” the RBI said.
“After considering the bank’s reply and oral submissions made in the personal hearing, RBI came to the conclusion that the aforesaid charges of non-compliance with RBI directions were substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty,” the statement said.
Among the disclosure of penalties made by SBI in its annual report for FY2019, the bank said RBI imposed a penalty of ₹1 crore on it for not monitoring the end-use of funds in respect of one of its borrowers.

Stressing that diversion of funds is a big concern for banks, State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar, on Thursday, said that 83 oversight agencies have been empanelled to continuously monitor end use of bank loans.
“How much oversight can bank do...The methods of lending will also have to undergo change. The consortium discipline or the multiple banking discipline has to be improved and there the regulator also has to play a role,” said Kumar, pointing out that there have been cases where a customer borrows from one bank and has a current account in another bank, which is used to divert funds. Commenting on the non-banking finance sector, he said there is adequate liquidity in the system after the measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India on the day of the Budget. “At the macro level, liquidity is not an issue. At the entity level, if there is an issue, that cannot be resolved by any measure at the macro level. The lender and the particular entity will have to sit down and find out a solution,” he told reporters on the sidelines of an event organised by Sahamati.
Kumar also expressed hope that government spending and measures for infrastructure investment announced in the Budget will give a push to private investment. “Private sector investment needs to be stepped up and it will definitely follow the expanding investment by the government and measures in the Budget,” he said, noting that many sectors such as oil and gas, renewable energy, and roads are seeing good demand.

84,2019-07-27,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide 
SBI (₹342.5)
SBI tumbled 3.8 per cent last week, breaking below the key support level of ₹350. The next support near ₹335 is holding well as of now. As long as SBI sustains above this support, a corrective rally to ₹350 is possible in the near term. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹350 are needed to ease the downside pressure and bring back the bullish sentiment. But a rally beyond ₹350 looks less probable now as fresh sellers are likely to emerge at higher levels. A pull-back from ₹350 can drag the stock lower to ₹335 again. An eventual break below the key base level of ₹335 will then increase the likelihood of the downtrend resuming and declining to ₹328. The level of ₹328 is a strong support where both the 21-week moving average as well as a trend-line support are poised. As such the current down-move can halt around ₹328 and a bounce to ₹335-340 is possible from there. But if SBI declines below ₹328, the down-move can extend to ₹320 in the ensuing weeks.










ITC (₹270.3)
ITC fell over a per cent in the initial part of the week, but managed to bounce thereafter. The stock made a low of ₹264.4 and reversed higher recovering all the loss. The 200-week moving average support is holding well as of now. However, a key resistance is at ₹273 (21-day moving average) which has to be breached to get a breather. A strong break above ₹273 can trigger a corrective rally to ₹278 and ₹282. The region between ₹282 and ₹285 is a strong resistance which is likely to cap the upside. A rise past ₹285 looks unlikely at the moment. On the other hand, if ITC fails to breach the immediate resistance level of ₹273 in the coming days, it can dip to test ₹263 again. A sideways consolidation between ₹263 and ₹273 is possible for some time. The bias will remain bearish. An eventual break below ₹263 can take the stock initially lower to ₹257. A further break below ₹257 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹245 – a strong long-term support.
 






Infosys (₹787.3)
Infosys rose last week to test ₹800 as expected, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹804.25 and oscillated between ₹782 and ₹805 all through the week. The near-term outlook is unclear. Support is at ₹780 and resistance at ₹800. The stock can trade sideways between ₹780 and ₹800 for some time. A breakout on either side of ₹780 or ₹800 will then determine the direction of the next move. A break below ₹780 can trigger profit-booking and drag the stock lower to ₹765. A cluster of supports is poised in the band between ₹765 and ₹750. So the downside could be limited to ₹750 if the stock declines below ₹780. On the other hand, if Infosys manages to sustain above ₹780, the bias will remain positive. It will keep the possibility high of the stock breaking above ₹800. Such a break above ₹800 will give a fresh boost to the stock. It will also indicate the resumption of the uptrend and take the stock up to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks.










RIL (₹1,214.1)
RIL tumbled 2.8 per cent, breaking below the crucial support level of ₹1,250. The price action over the last month indicates that the stock has been lacking strong buyers to take it above ₹1,300. This coupled with the sharp fall below ₹1,250 gives an initial sign of the long-term uptrend getting reversed. A further fall below the psychological level of ₹1,200 will confirm the same. Such a fall will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to ₹1,130-1,120 in the coming weeks. The move below ₹1,200 could be sharp and swift as it could trigger strong profit-booking. But, if RIL manages to sustain above ₹1,200, a bounce to ₹1,250 is possible. In such a scenario, a sideways move in the ₹1,200-1,250 band can be seen for some time. RIL has to rise past ₹1,250 decisively to ease the downside pressure. A rise to ₹1,300 is possible on a break above ₹1,250. But such a strong up-move looks unlikely at the moment as fresh sellers are likely to emerge around ₹1,250 levels and cap the upside. 










Tata Steel (₹445.2)
Tata Steel extended its fall and kept the downtrend intact. The stock was down 2.8 per cent last week. An immediate resistance is in the ₹448-450 region and the next significant one is at ₹470, which can cap the upside. A rise past ₹470 looks unlikely. Tata Steel is likely to tumble towards ₹400 in the coming weeks. The region around ₹400 is a key support. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement support is also poised around ₹400. As such, the current fall can halt at ₹400. A corrective rally to ₹450 is possible if Tata Steel manages to bounce from ₹400. But the upside of this corrective rally is likely to be capped at ₹450. But if the stock fails to bounce from ₹400 and falls further, the downside pressure will increase. The break below ₹400 will see the stock tumbling to ₹350 or lower over the medium term.

83,2019-07-29,State Bank,"SBI plans to trim rates on retail domestic term deposits by 5-75 bps 
State Bank of India has decided to cut interest rates on retail domestic term deposits across all maturities by 5-75 basis points with effect from August 1, in view of the falling interest rate scenario and surplus liquidity.
India’s largest bank has also decided to reduce interest rates on domestic bulk term deposits in seven out of eight maturity buckets by 5-75 basis points. 
In the case of both retail domestic term deposits (below ₹2 crore) and domestic bulk deposit (₹2 crore and above), SBI has effected the steepest cut of 75 bps in the seven days to 45 days maturity bucket, where the new interest rate will be 5 per cent against 5.75 per cent now.
The smallest interest rate cut of 5 bps is in the two years to less than three years bucket to 6.70 per cent from 6.75 per cent for retail as well as bulk depositors.
In the case of retail depositors, the highest interest that SBI will offer after the new rates come into effect is 6.80 per cent in the one year to less than than one years’ maturity bucket. Currently, the interest rate in this bucket is 7 per cent. In the case of bulk depositors, the highest interest that SBI will offer is 6.70 per cent in the one year to less than than two years (current interest rate: 6.70 per cent) and two years to less than three years (current interest rate: 6.75 per cent) maturity buckets.
The rate cut comes even as NBFCs such as Shriram Transport Finance Company are offering higher interest rates on non-convertible debentures, ranging from 9.30 per cent (for 30 months) to 9.70 per cent (for 84 months) to mop up resources."
79,2019-07-30,State Bank,"SBI tweaks guidelines for basic savings deposits


State Bank of India (SBI) has fine-tuned its own basic savings bank deposit (BSBD) policy, acting on cue from a recent RBI circular on the same.
The RBI had, on June 10, said that commercial banks need to offer holders of BSBD accounts a minimum of four withdrawals in a month, including automatic teller machine (ATM) withdrawals. 
The BSBD account aims to drive financial inclusion among the economically weaker sections, and is packaged as a savings account that offers certain minimum facilities free of charge to the holders. 
The RBI circular on BSBD accounts seems to have prompted SBI to review its own guidelines governing these accounts, and further finetune them.
All branches and offices of SBI have been issued instructions in this connection, which came into effect on July 1. They are applicable uniformly to all BC outlets, irrespective of their locations. The most significant condition to satisfy before opening a BSBD account is that the customer would need to declare that he/she does not have a BSBD account with any other bank. 
There is no change to the existing guidelines with respect to waiver of any minimum balance with the account offer of ATM card or ATM-cum-debit card. 
There is no change either to the guideline that determines the bouquet of services available, which include deposit and withdrawal of cash at bank branch as well as ATMs, receipt/credit of money through electronic payment channels, or by means of deposit/collection of cheques drawn by Central/State Government agencies and departments. 
As for the guideline that says there will be no limit on the number of deposits that can be made in a month, SBI has clarified that there is no limit on either the number or value of deposits that can be made in a month."
80,2019-07-30,State Bank,"Bank deposit rates
This refers to ‘SBI plans to trim rates on retail domestic term deposits by 5-75 bps’ (July 30). The rising provision coverage for bad loans, the dismal progress in the recovery of bad loans and prudentially written-off loans, deep haircuts banks are incurring during the resolution of bad assets, and the losses arising out of frauds are also escalating the cost of funds of the banks.
The growing cost of funds is forcing banks to cut down the interest rates on deposits. However, rather than cut down the rate of interest on retail deposits, banks need to look for alternative ways to bring down the cost of funds. In fact, the burden of the rising cost of credit is being borne by the depositors.
As the rate of interest is the price paid to depositors for parting with the funds it needs to be competitive to not only attract the new depositors but also to retain the existing customers. Lowering the rate of interest is a disincentive to the depositors, and as such will negatively impact the growth of the resources of the banks, more particularly at a time when banks are recording sluggish growth in the deposits.

Demonetisation revisited
Three years have gone by since demonetisation was introduced in 2016, and it’s time to look at its impact in the financial arena. Have the government’s goals of curbing black money and counterfeit notes been achieved. Definitely not. But the government has been boasting that demonetisation has helped usher in a cashless economy. But the fact is even today people prefer cash payments to digital for various reasons. It is true that ATM usage has increased, but that’s mostly in urban areas. A study has found that demand for cash is higher in States with a high population density.

It is prudent to align the varied capital-market regulations with the larger economic goals and utilise the well-acclaimed political goodwill to boost business sentiment. To generate sustainable revenue growth and ensure compliance with tax norms, it is important to optimise interest rates, to not only promote retail participation across market segments but also to curb inflationary pressures and channel long-term foreign investments. Diktats aimed to enhance transparency/disclosures are paramount to socio-economic growth.
Lender-friendly IBC norms ought to consider aspects of business continuity and CSR initiatives, to surmount insolvency-risks and serve the interests of vendors, employees and shareholders. Frequent amendments to the laws can affect standardisation, robustness and investor sentiment. Allowing promoters/guarantors to regain control of the firm within a stipulated time-period could defeat the very purpose of the law, devised to prevent back-door entry of dubious owners and curb instances of wilful default.

Curb deforestation
As per the results of the fourth cycle of All India Tiger Estimation 2018, the tiger population has increased by 33 per cent to 2,967 in 2018 from 2,226 in 2014. Reports say that the tiger population has been growing at an annual rate of 6 per cent. While this is welcome, of concern is the fact that the big cats and other wild animals are straying into human habitats, thanks to continued deforestation. Encroachment of forestland by unscrupulous elements has gone unchallenged. Before taking steps towards afforestation, the government should conserve the existing forests and take back the encroached lands.

82,2019-07-30,State Bank,"SBI tightens lending norms for auto dealers
State Bank of India (SBI) has tightened lending terms dramatically for auto dealerships, according to a source and an internal memo seen by Reuters, seeking to reduce its exposure to risk from a sector in the midst of a sharp downturn.
The shadow banking crisis that began to unfold in India during mid-2018 has deepened this year. The liquidity crunch in non-bank financing, higher insurance costs and rises in taxation have served to increase the pressure on the car sector, with monthly auto sales falling by 17-20% since April.
Monthly passenger vehicle sales in June fell by the biggest margin in 18 years.

In one internal memo for financing dealers selling vehicles made by Hyundai Motor Co's India unit, SBI said it is revising the lending terms because of “growing stress” in the carmaker's portfolio.
Similar memos have been sent to dealerships for all other brands, said a senior SBI official aware of the matter, though Reuters has not seen memos relating to other carmakers.
As part of the revised terms, the country's largest bank by assets has decided to halt lending to dealers of Hyundai Motor India unless they provide a minimum of 25% collateral, it said in the memo.
Hyundai dealers that had already received loans from the bank will also have to provide security of between 25% and 50% of the loan amount, SBI said in the memo dated March 27 and signed by the chief general manager for supply chain financing.
Hyundai did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment outside business hours.
The company is India's second-largest carmaker with more than 16% of a market accounting for 3.3 million passenger vehicles in the year to March 31.
Japanese carmaker Suzuki Motor Corp's Indian business, Maruti Suzuki, dominates with a 50% share while rivals including Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford and Nissan also produce and sell cars in the country.
While it is known that several Indian banks have broadly tightened lending to the auto sector, specifics have not been disclosed.
“There is an auto sales slowdown and we have substantial exposure to autos. We want to stay safe and this was done to mitigate risk and protect us,” said the SBI official, who asked not to be named because the details had not been made public.
SBI's loan exposure in the auto retail market was ₹71,880 crore ($10.5 billion) at the end of March, according to regulatory filings.
“In view of the current slowdown in the auto sector, the bank is continuously reviewing its exposure,” SBI told Reuters, adding that it is evaluating the situation and engaging with dealers to ensure the sector does not face any undue stress."
81,2019-07-30,State Bank,"Why SBI slashing deposit rates, may not lead to huge cuts by private banks


The study states that income is the most important determinant of bank deposit growth

The study states that income is the most important determinant of bank deposit growth
   -  Khongtham


After dragging its feet and cutting deposit rates only marginally despite RBI’s 75 bps policy rate cut so far this year, SBI slashed deposit rates sharply on Monday. The cut in rates has been the most in the very short-term deposits of upto 179 days. Term deposit rates in the 7-45 days bucket have been slashed by 75 bps while that in the 46-179 days category by 50 bps. In deposits of higher tenure, the rate reduction has been much lower 10-20 bps. Given that nearly 24 per cent of SBI’s deposits are in the up to 6 month category (according to annual report), sharp cuts in deposit rates, could result in lower lending rates as the bank reduces its MCLR—benchmark lending rates. Under MCLR, banks are mandated to calculate their cost of funds based on the latest rates offered on deposits or borrowings.
But will other banks follow suit and slash their deposit rates as well? While some public sector banks may toe SBI’s line, private sector banks may not be in a hurry to cut deposit rates steeply.
Chunk of SBI’s reduction has happened in the very short term deposits—up to 6 months. Currently even after this sharp cut, rates offered by private sector banks such as ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank are not significantly higher than SBI. Thus they do not have leeway to lower rates sharply.
For instance, before the latest rate cuts, SBI offered 5.75 per cent for deposits in the 7 to 45 days bucket; it has cut rates in this bucket to 5 per cent now.
HDFC and ICICI Bank bifurcate deposits further within this tenure—7 to 14 days, 15-29 days and 30-45 days—and offer 3.5-5.5 per cent. This is more or less close to the revised rates offered by SBI (on a weighted basis) and hence these banks may only tinker with rates. Sharp rate cuts seem unlikely.
Similarly in the 46-179 days deposits where SBI has lowered deposit rate from 6.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent, HDFC and ICICI Bank offer 6 per cent currently. The headroom for cuts appear limited here too.
In the higher tenure deposits of over six months, SBI has cut deposit rates by a much lower 10-20 bps. Here too private banks may not be in a hurry to slash their deposit rates.
In the six month to 1 year deposits, the two private lenders have been offering a higher 6.5-6.75 per cent, against SBI’s earlier 6.4 per cent. In the two to three year tenure, HDFC and ICICI Bank offer 7.3 per cent, way above SBI’s earlier 6.75 per cent (after cut 6.7 per cent).
Hence rates offered by SBI have already been significantly lower than private banks. But strong credit growth vis-à-vis weak growth in deposits have forced private banks to keep deposit rates high, limiting their ability to cut rates sharply despite the wide gap. Many private banks continue to sport a very high credit deposit ratio of 80-100 per cent, on the back of strong loan growth. Hence while SBI’s deposit rate cut action may offer some headroom for cutting rates, steep cuts are unlikely.
Also, each bank’s action on rates would differ based on the composition of their deposits. While on an aggregate basis deposits up to 1 year constitute 45 per cent of deposits for all banks (according to RBI report), at the micro level there are wide variations. For instance, for SBI 24 per cent of deposits are in the up to six months category and 19 per cent in the six months to one year bucket. For HDFC Bank 24 per cent are in the up to six months while 39 per cent are in the 1-3 year bucket."

Once declared a wilful defaulter, a borrower/guarantor will remain in that category till the closure of the loan, irrespective of the outstanding in the account
   -  Reuters




State Bank of India (SBI) has put together a comprehensive policy on wilful defaulters, which envisages setting up three wilful default identification committees (WDICs). 
Each of these committees will be headed by a Deputy Managing Director (DMD). There will be quarterly reviews by branches for identification, declaration of wilful defaulters, and taking action against them.
As per the policy, proposals for classification of borrowers as wilful defaulters have to be placed before any of the three WDICs based on the area of operation – WDIC-I (south), WDIC-II (north), and WDIC-III (central). 
Besides the DMD, each committee will have eight General Managers as members. The committees will be supported by a secretariat, which will submit the proposals received from the branches for the identification of wilful defaulters to them. According to the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), a wilful default is deemed to have occurred if a unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligations to the lender even when it has the capacity to honour the said obligations; and has not utilised the finance from the lender for the specific purpose for which the finance was availed but has diverted the funds for other uses. 
Further, instances of wilful default include a unit siphoning off the funds that have not been utilised for the specific purpose for which it was availed, nor are the funds available with the unit in the form of other assets; and has disposed or removed the movable fixed assets or immovable property given for the purpose of securing a term loan without the knowledge of the bank/lender. 
India’s largest bank said it will declare borrowers with outstanding of ₹25 lakh and above as wilful defaulters in terms of the RBI guidelines.
SBI said if the WDIC identifies a borrower, promoter/director, and the firm as wilful defaulter, the order will be sent to the review committee – comprising a Managing Director and any two independent directors – for review. The order will become final only after it is reviewed/confirmed by the review committee.
Once declared a wilful defaulter, a borrower/guarantor will remain in that category till the closure of the loan, irrespective of the outstanding in the account. SBI wants all branches/operating units, and respective controllers to conduct quarterly reviews of all non-performing asset (NPA) accounts maintained with them (outstanding above ₹25 lakh), and maintain an exhaustive and duly approved list of all such reviewed accounts.
This quarterly review for identification of instances of wilful default will ensure that no NPA accounts are left unexamined.
SBI’s branches will consider publishing photographs of only those borrowers, including proprietors/partners/directors/guarantors of borrower firms/companies, who have been declared wilful defaulters, strictly following the mechanism for identification and declaration of wilful defaulters, and if the total outstanding in the accounts is ₹3 crore and above.
As per the policy, in respect of education loans, under no circumstances will the photographs be published. Branches may also consider excluding borrowers who are continuously engaging with the bank for settlement of dues.
The bank’s comprehensive policy on wilful defaulters is aimed at putting in place a system to disseminate credit information pertaining to wilful defaulters to caution other lenders to ensure that further finance is not made available to them."
77,2019-08-02,State Bank,"SBI chief hopes for a dip in bad loans ...
State Bank of India (SBI) on Friday reported a standalone net profit of ₹2,312 crore in the first quarter ended June 30, 2019, compared to a net loss of ₹4,876 crore in the year ago period.
The bank also reported higher fresh slippages of ₹16,212 crore in Q1FY20 against ₹7,505 crore in the preceding (Jan-March 2019) quarter.
Higher slippages, among others, arose from an exposure (as part of a consortium) of ₹2,014 crore to a ‘Mahanavratna’ (government entity), which was performing in its own book but had to be treated as non-performing due to the exposure of another consortium bank turning sour; slippages of about ₹2,000 crore due to the Maharashtra Government implementing agriculture debt waiver scheme and slippages from the SME segment.
SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar expects the slippage ratio (fresh accretion of NPAs during the year/total standard assets at the beginning of the year) to decline below 2 per cent by March-end 2020 as against 2.83 per cent in the June 2019 quarter.
Gross NPAs (GNPAs) declined by ₹4,256 crore during the quarter to ₹1,68,494 crore. In percentage terms, GNPAs, as at June-end 2019, were static at 7.53 per cent of gross advances vis-a-vis the preceding quarter.
Net NPAs nudged up a tad to 3.07 per cent of net advances against 3.01 per cent in the preceding quarter.
The Bank is planning to raise ₹7,000 crore by issuing additional Tier-I bonds. It may raise capital via an equity issuance, depending on the growth story and the market circumstances. SBI has shareholders’ approval to raise ₹20,000 crore via equity. It is seeking to list its subsidiary SBI Card by the last quarter of the current financial year.
Of SBI’s 453 accounts admitted to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) aggregating ₹1,13,809 crore, three accounts are in an advanced stage of resolution with expected recovery of ₹16,000 crore, Kumar said.
He added that the government has moved quickly in effecting amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the outlook for recoveries remains positive."

 State Bank of India on Friday reported a standalone net profit of ₹2,312 crore in the first quarter ended June 30, 2019, compared with a net loss of ₹4,876 crore in the year ago period. Lower provisioning and better net interest margins helped the largest public sector bank make profits despite higher slippages. 
The share price of India’s largest bank closed at ₹308.45 apiece on the BSE, down 2.76 per cent over the previous close . 
The bottomline in the reporting quarter (Q1FY20) was supported by a 20 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in non-interest income at ₹8,015 crore and 35 per cent yoy decline in total provisions, including towards loan loss, standard assets and investment depreciation, at ₹10,934 crore. 
Net interest income (the difference between interest earned and interest paid) edged up 5 per cent YoY to ₹22,939 crore.
The bank reported higher fresh slippages of ₹16,212 crore in Q1FY20 against ₹7,505 crore in the preceding (Jan-March 2019) quarter. The slippages came mainly from segments such as corporate (₹5,354 crore), agriculture (₹4,239 crore), small and medium enterprises (₹3,964 crore) and personal (₹2,438 crore).
SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said his bank has maintained its focus on increasing the pre-provision core operating profit, which increased 11 per cent YoY to ₹13,246 crore. He added that the reporting quarter is the fourth consecutive quarter that the bank has reported a net profit and the financial performance has been fairly satisfactory despite certain challenges facing the economy and the banking sector."
75,2019-08-03,State Bank,"SBI reports lower bad loans, but higher slippages and write-offs are a concern 
At first glance, SBI reporting a profit in the latest June quarter against a substantial loss last year, along with a marginal dip in bad loans and lower provisioning, may enthuse investors.
But the fact that the fall in bad loans has been due to substantial write-offs, offsetting the significant rise in slippages in the quarter, offers little comfort.
Bad loan provisions though down sequentially and year-on-year, remain elevated at ₹11,600-odd crore. SBI’s special mention (SM) accounts book has also inched up in the June quarter, indicating persistant stress.
After steep slippages of ₹33,670 crore in the March 2018 quarter, when the RBI’s earlier circular on stressed assets accelerated NPA recognition, slippages moderated in FY19, from about ₹10,000-crore quarterly in the first half to ₹4,000-7,000 crore in the second half.
In the latest June quarter, SBI has added ₹16,212 crore to its bad loans, hardly comforting for a bank already sitting on a bad loan book of over ₹1.6-lakh crore.
Also, after the one-off recovery in the June quarter last year, recoveries have not been significant. Much of the reduction in bad loans has come from write-offs in the past few quarters. In the June quarter too, write-offs stood at a substantial ₹15,400 crore (reduction in bad loans, less recovery). Write-offs mean that banks fully provide for bad loans (taking a knock on profits) and take them off the books. Recovery rate from such accounts in the past has been very poor.
SBI’s SMA1 (where payments are overdue by 31-60 days) and SMA2 (overdue by 61-90 days) book increased to ₹10,289 crore in the latest quarter, from ₹7762 crore in the March quarter. This includes ₹2,014 crore pertaining to a state government entity.
Also, post RBI’s June circular (revised framework for resolution of stressed accounts), in the event of a default, banks have to decide on the resolution plan, which requires all lenders to enter into an inter-creditor agreement (ICA); in 20 standard accounts of SBI, the ICA has been signed or likely to be signed. These accounts amount to ₹19,142 crore and carry about 15 per cent provision.
A substantial stressed assets pool leaves open the possibility of large slippages. Quick resolution of large accounts under the IBC will be critical to drive earnings in the coming quarters.
SBI’s domestic loan growth of 12 per cent in the June quarter is led by retail loan growth of 18.6 per cent. Agri and SME growth were modest at 6.8 per cent and 2 per cent respectively; corporate loan growth stood at 11.6 per cent.
SBI’s loan growth lags that of leading private sector banks that have managed to grow their loan books by 17-19 per cent in the June quarter. The muted 5 per cent growth in net interest income was due to a one-off recovery of ₹1,900 crore in the same quarter last year; excluding this, net interest income grew by 15 per cent.
While the recent sharp cut in deposit rates should aid net interest margin in the coming quarter, SBI’s modest deposit growth is a concern. Total deposits and term deposits grew by a modest 7 per cent. This is a far cry from the robust 20-30 per cent growth in term deposits of leading private sector banks. The sharp deposit rate cut by SBI can impact deposit growth further."
74,2019-08-05,State Bank,"SBI policy on wilful defaulters lauded
Bank employees have welcomed State of Bank India’s (SBI) new policy on wilful defaulters, saying their strong stance on the issue has been vindicated at a time when it had threatened to go out of hand.
Cases of wilful defaults have increased in recent times, especially during the last five years, said A Raghavan, Joint Secretary, National Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE).
Even Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had taken exception to the issue in Parliament. The number of wilful defaulters went up from 5,349 to 8,582 in five years since 2014, the FM had told the Lok Sabha on June 24. 
“Given this (number), it is welcome that concrete steps are getting formulated to address the menace, which has economic as well as social implications, ” Raghavan said. 
Steps/tests formulated in the new policy to determine a ‘wilful default’ appear to be transparent, as the person/entity in question gets all rights as a borrower to present his/its case before various committees.
One could, however, argue that facilities allowed under an RBI master circular of July 1, 2013, are not available any more. For instance, there was a provision for personal hearing before the Grievance Redressal Committee headed by the Chairman/MD of the bank prior to an entity being classified a ‘wilful defaulter,’ Raghavan said. 
In a similar vein, not allowing a time of 15 days for making a representation against the preliminary decisions of the first committee may be argued as denial of natural justice.
“These may be considered favourably, as has been directed by Justice RF Nariman in his judgment in the Civil Appeal 4776 of 2019 before the Supreme Court on May 8 this year,” said Raghavan. It is however, important that the real culprits and financial offenders are booked and treated as criminal offenders, and whatever possible assets be recovered from them.
“It is pertinent here to point out that during 2014-2019 alone, public sector banks had together made an operating profit of ₹7.17-lakh crore. But the entire profit, plus an additional ₹40,192 crore from reserves totalling ₹7.58-lakh crore, was provided for NPAs,” he said. 
“Even the wage revision for bank employees, due from November 2017, has been withheld on account of this despite, bankers having worked really hard for the success of government projects,” he added."

Slippages were elevated in 1QFY20 (₹17,000 crore, 3.4 per cent annualised), with corporate slippages contributing 33 per cent. As a result, specific credit costs were elevated at 2.3 per cent. The SMA pool of the bank is now at ₹10,300 crore (0.5 per cent of loans) — however, the bank has also disclosed another pool of accounts (₹19,100 crore) where inter-creditor agreements are to be signed/likely to be signed in the near future.
Ex-overlaps, the total stress pool of the bank is now at ₹26,800 crore (1.3 per cent of loans). The stress pool includes 2 lumpy accounts (totalling c.₹14,000 crore) — a stressed HFC and a renewable energy solutions provider on which the bank holds total provisions of c.16 per cent (₹2,300 crore). We factor in the increase in the stress pool in our credit cost estimates – we now build slippages of 2.4 per cent (vs 2 per cent earlier) in FY20E, and as a result build credit costs of 1.3 per cent in FY20E (i.e. ₹32,100 crore vs ₹21,500 crore earlier). Consequently, our earnings estimates for FY20E have been cut by c.27 per cent."

The troubled wind-turbine maker Suzlon Energy offered to repay about ₹8,500 crore ($1.2 billion) to lenders as part of a bad-debt-resolution plan, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Creditors led by State Bank of India will have to take a haircut of as much as 44 per cent on Suzlon’s debt if the offer is accepted, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public. The settlement plan backed by Vestas Wind Systems A/C is the only bid in front of lenders after Brookfield Asset Management Inc. dropped out of the race, one of the people said.
The Pune-based manufacturer has been embattled after the Centre shifted to auctions in 2017 as the preferred method to install wind projects. That’s limited orders for domestic turbine manufacturers amid rising operational costs and stiffer competition from global players.
It is a tough situation for Suzlon with tight competition, amid rising operational costs and funding costs, said Mathew Antony, managing partner of Aditya Consulting. The company needs strategic investors with long-term investment window of at least 10 years.
A spokesman for SBI and spokeswoman for Suzlon didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. Suzlons long-term bank facilities were downgraded to D from BB in April by Care Ratings and the company missed payments on its dollar-denominated convertibles last month."
70,2019-08-10,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide 
SBI (₹291.3)
SBI continued the fall for the fifth consecutive week. The stock tumbled 5.5 per cent last week. With this fall, the stock has plummeted 21.4 per cent over the last five weeks. On the charts, there is room for the fall to extend further in the coming days. The levels of ₹304 and ₹307 are the key near-term resistances which can cap the upside. There is possibility of a sideways consolidation between ₹285 and ₹307 (200-day moving average) in the near term. But a strong rise past ₹307 looks less likely now as the broader bias continues to remain negative. As such, SBI is likely to decline eventually below ₹285 and extend the current downtrend to ₹275-273 or even ₹269. The broad region between ₹275 and ₹269 is a strong support zone, which can halt the current fall. A corrective rally to ₹290-300 is possible from this support zone on short-covering. But if SBI declines below ₹269, it will come under more pressure. Such a break will increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards ₹245-240 or even ₹230.










ITC (₹254.2)
ITC fell about 4 per cent last week breaking below the support level of ₹263 (200-week moving average) as expected. The downtrend remains intact. However, ITC is coming closer to an intermediate support level of ₹250. If it manages to bounce from this support, a corrective up-move to ₹260 or ₹265 is possible. ITC may, thus, remain range-bound between ₹250 and ₹265 for some time. However, a strong rally beyond ₹265 looks unlikely. An eventual break below ₹250 will see the stock resuming the downtrend to ₹240 — possibly the last leg of move in the current downtrend. The level of ₹240 is a strong long-term trend support, which can halt the current downtrend. A strong bounce from ₹240 can take the stock up to ₹260-265. There is possibility of the stock forming a base by consolidating between ₹240 and ₹265. A decisive break above ₹265 can start a fresh rally, targeting ₹290-300 over the medium term. But if ITC declines below ₹240, the fall can extend to ₹230-228 band.










Infosys (₹790.1)
Infosys has remained stuck between ₹755 and ₹805 over the last four weeks. Within this range, the stock rose about 2 per cent last week. The near-term outlook continues to remain unclear. The up-move in the past week looks weak. This reduces the possibility l of the stock breaking above ₹805 — the upper end of the range at the moment. The stock can reverse lower again towards ₹765 and ₹755 and maintain the sideways move t for some more time. A breakout on either side of ₹755 or ₹805 will determine the direction of the next move. If Infosys manages to break above ₹805, it can gain fresh momentum. Such a break will indicate the resumption of the broader uptrend. It will then take the stock up to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if Infosys breaks the range below ₹755, it can come under pressure. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹740. A further break below ₹740 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending towards ₹715 and ₹700 on profit-booking.










RIL (₹1,162.0)
RIL tumbled over 7 per cent intra-week to a low of ₹1,095.65. However, the stock has managed to claw-back sharply from the low. But this bounce-back is just a short-covering rally which may not last long. A further rise to test the immediate resistance level of ₹1,190 is possible in the near term. A break above ₹1,190 will extend the corrective rally to ₹1,220. However, a further rise past ₹1,220 is less likely as fresh sellers can emerge at higher levels. Also, the indicators on the charts are bearish. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average. This is a bearish signal, indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, RIL is likely to reverse lower either from ₹1,190 or ₹1,220. It will then take the stock lower to ₹1,100-1,090 levels again. Inability to break below ₹1,090 can keep the stock sideways between ₹1,090 and ₹1,220 for some time. But the bias will continue to remain negative and RIL is likely to decline below ₹1,090 eventually. Such a break will then drag the stock lower to ₹1,050 and ₹1,030










Tata Steel (₹362.3)
Tata Steel is on a free fall and has declined to ₹360 as expected. The stock tumbled 11.4 per cent last week. Tata Steel has plummeted over 28 per cent in the last six weeks. An immediate support is at ₹358. If Tata Steel manages to bounce from this support, a corrective rally to ₹385 or ₹400 is possible on short-covering. A rise past ₹400 is unlikely now as fresh sellers can emerge at higher levels and keep the broader downtrend intact. As such, an eventual break below ₹358 will see the current fall extending to ₹330 and ₹325. As cautioned last week, from a long-term perspective, the current downtrend which had begun in 2018 is looking strong. This downtrend may have the potential to drag Tata Steel to ₹250-230. An intermediate halt and a corrective bounce is possible from the ₹310-300 support zone before the targets of ₹250-230 are achieved.

After Etihad declined to bail out Jet Airways on Monday, Anil Agarwal-led Volcan Investments has decided to withdraw its Expression of Interest (EoI).
On Saturday, Volcan Investments had submitted their EoI for a stake in the airline.
In a statement by the Agarwal's family trust-led Volcan, the company said, ""The EoI for Jet Airways by Volcan was exploratory in nature. On further evaluation and considering other priorities, we intend to not pursue this further.""
In response to BusinessLine's query, Etihad on Monday said that they have declined to lodge an expression of interest to reinvest in Jet Airways because of unresolved issues concerning Jet’s liabilities.
Earlier it was said that Mumbai-based Hinduja Group and Etihad were to partner to propose an EoI for the airline.
The spokesperson added, ""Etihad presented a conditional expression of interest to reinvest in Jet as a minority stakeholder, with an agreed partner, but unfortunately this did not materialise. Etihad remained engaged in the process, but despite the endeavours of everyone involved there remained very significant issues relating to Jet’s previous liabilities. Regrettably, in these circumstances, it was neither feasible for nor responsible of Etihad to reinvest in Jet at this time,"" A spokesperson of Etihad said.
“Naresh Goyal, the promoter of the airline held 51 per cent stake. The Mumbai-headquartered Jetparterend with the Abu Dhabi-based airline in 2013 with later held 24 per cent stake in the airline ""at a time when Jet needed significant financial support,"" Etihad said.
The Resolution Professional (RP) appointed for Jet Airways had, earlier, set a deadline of August 3. Since the RP did not receive any EoIs, the last day to submit the bid the EoI was extended to August 10.
Players including Hinduja, Etihad, Apollo Tyres, AdiGro, among others were seemingly interested in buying Jet Airways’assets though formal bids are yet to be placed by anyone.
However, the reports suggested that the airline has not submitted EoI for the company. Etihad held 24 per cent stake in the company in the airline that was grounded on April 18.
After its grounding, State Bank of India, the lead lender dragged the airline to the NCLT to recover dues. Ashish Chhawchharia, the RP, had received 16,643 claims worth ₹ 24,888 crore from financial, operational and other creditors. Only claims of 33 financial creditors worth ₹8,463 crore had been admitted.
According to sources, the company has six Boeing 777, three Boeing 737 and 2 A330 owned by the airline, along with engineering spare parts, and a few properties."

State Bank of India is in active talks with automobile dealers to provide solutions for their current financial hardships over inventory build-ups arising from demand slowdown in the automobile sector, a top official said.
“We are talking to each dealer. We also had meetings with the Federation of Auto Dealers. We are actively engaged with all of them. On a case-to-case basis, whichever dealer has faced any problem on account of excess inventories, we have been working out solutions for all of them,” said PK Gupta, Managing Director-Retail & Digital Banking, SBI,  here on Sunday.
He was responding to a query on the steps SBI was taking to tackle the current slowdown in the automobile sector.
Gupta said that SBI was looking at extending the credit period for those auto dealers faced with inventory build-up due to poor demand.
“As a bank, we can only focus on the financing side. Our main focus is make available funds at cheaper cost for those retail customers keen on buying cars. We also fund the dealers when they buy the cars from the manufacturer. However, for the aspect of revival of demand, only government can step in,” he said. Gupta said there has been a “little bit of downturn” in auto loans from the bank in recent months. He, however, expressed confidence that the economy would recover in the coming days, especially with the government spending on infrastructure.
Asked if bank managers were apprehensive in handing out auto loans in the wake of slowdown, Gupta replied in the negative. “As long as the credit proposals meet our underwriting standards, the branch managers cannot say ‘no’ to any loan,” he said. 
Meanwhile, speaking of the two-day ‘Ideas Conclave’ that the SBI top management held with bank managers across the country, Gupta said this was the first stage of the bottom-up consultative process of the bank.
Commenting on the outcome of the meeting held for 37 regional business offices at 30 centres under the Delhi circle, Gupta said that the discussion helped in simplifying the processes and fine tuning the products.
“We have got several ideas from our branch managers. One such idea is how we could further smoothen the sanctioning process for 59-minutes-loan that is now available for MSMEs,” he said.
SBI will now look to see if it could convert the in-principle sanction to regular sanction in seven days and also ensure that loans get disbursed within 8-10 days after the in-principle sanction.
Gupta also said that one other idea that came up at the meeting was improving the features of the ‘SBI YONO Krishi’ App. In the next two months, SBI plans to add new features like mandi prices and weather situation into this App, to provide more information to farmers, he said."

 State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Sunday said credit demand remains subdued and there is a need for stimulus in the economy.
 Though lack of credit demand exists in the economy, there is no supply-side constraint as the public sector banks are more or less well-capitalised, he said. “Demand for credit in the economy is subdued. There is a need for stimulus in the economy”, Kumar told reporters here.
 He was in the city to attend the multi-level consultation programme with the branch managers of SBI in the region. “There is no supply-side constraint. More or less, the public sector banks are well capitalised and bank rates also moderated,” he said.
 Kumar hoped that monsoon will have a positive impact. Increased spending by the government and the upcoming festival season would boost demand, Kumar added."
66,2019-08-18,State Bank,"Farm lending process needs an overhaul: SBI chief


Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI




Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI


State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Sunday said that the present model of agricultural lending in the country was not “viable” and needs an “overhaul”.
The high level of non-performing assets (NPA) in farm sector is an issue.
SBI had registered slippages to the tune of ₹16,000 crore during the April-June 2019 quarter. The retail sector, particularly, agricultural advances, accounted for a bulk (nearly 69 per cent) of the total slippages at around ₹11,000 crore.
Kumar was in the city for a consultative meeting with six regions of Kolkata circle.
Fragmented landholdings make agricultural lending unviable. FPOs or Farmer Producer Organisations can help dealing with the problem of landholding, he added.
“These issues are being discussed with an open mind. Once these consultations are over we should be able to come up with a blueprint,” he said.
According to Kumar, credit growth has been muted primarily because of demand side constraints.
“Credit demand as of now is subdued but there is no supply side constraints. Banks are adequately capitalised, interest rates have moderated and the system has surplus liquidity,” he said.
If monsoons are good, which looks to be positive so far, and festival season demand and government’s infrastructure spending pick up then credit offtake will rise in the second half of this fiscal, he said.
When asked about the possibility of a fiscal stimulus to boost the economy, he said that consultations were on. “We have to wait....,” he said.
SBI is expecting 12-14 per cent growth in advances this fiscal. “I have sufficient liquidity but I cannot deploy it, I need demand for corporate credit to grow,” he said.
The country’s largest lender felt that it would be difficult to pass on the entire transition of repo rate cut to customers as it would affect the interests of depositors. The bank is however, examining the possibility of providing its home loan borrowers the option of choosing between repo rate linked lending and MCLR rate.
The 2-day consultative process, which ended on Sunday, was aimed at identifying the issues and challenges faced by various branches and how to improve their performances.
“There is a lot of participation and enthusiasm because this is the first time that an exercise of this nature has been undertaken. The mega branch level consultation meet in the banking sector will not only help align the public sector banking system with national banking priorities, it will also be a kind of performance audit for branches,” he said.
The discussions were held across eight different zones of the bank over the past two days.
There were eight key parameters for discussion which included credit growth; infrastructure financing; financial inclusion; flow of credit to agriculture, MSME and housing sectors; and digitisation among others.
Based on the initial discussions held in various zones, nearly 25 per cent of the bank’s branches may be performing below par, 50 per cent at par and 25 per cent above par. Nearly 56 per cent of transactions of the bank happen on digital channel, the aim would be to increase it up to 75-80 per cent.
“The exercise will be over today and the data received region by region will be analysed and then next week there will be state-level consultations where all the public sector banks operating in the state will come together and seek and deliberate on whatever feedback has come. A state-level strategy will then be formulated and then it will be deliberated at the national level,” he said."

 The Local Head Office of State Bank of India (SBI), Kerala, and the Regional Office of Canara Bank, Convenor of the State-Level Banking Committee (SLBC), joined banks elsewhere to host two-day consultative sessions on Saturday and Sunday. 
Mrigendra Lal Das, Chief General Manager, SBI, said that the sessions were held at all 29 Regional Offices covering all branches in the state based on the advice from Department of Financial Services (DFS), Ministry of Finance. 
The DFS advice, which BusinessLine has seen, said the bottom-up process of consultations will involve discussions at the branch/regional level, SLBC/State level and the national level. 
It will also include a review of the banks’ performance during the last five years and detailed discussions. They will be aligned at alignment of banking with national priorities, stimulating ideas, and inculcating a sense of involvement among bankers. 
At SBI, Regional Offices saw the respective heads sitting along with Branch Managers from the regional jurisdiction represented by the Deputy General Manager, and senior officials from the Local Head Office, Thiruvananthapuram. 
SBI has six Administrative Offices (AOs) in Kerala Circle, and Chief General Manager Das attended sessions at all five Regional Offices under the Ernakulam AO. 
Giri Kumar Nair, Chief General Manager, Corporate Centre, and Parthasarathy Patra, General Manager, attended the sessions in the Thiruvananthapuram AO while Rumay Dey, General Manager, took care of the Kozhikode and Trissur AOs.
This was the first of its kind event where in the Branch Managers themselves were asked to review their performance, deliberate on the issues before the banking sector, and ideate on future strategy and the way forward. 
It focused on the ways and means to increase credit to various sectors of the economy; enhance use of technology to bring about innovation; and enable big data analytics to make banking citizen-centric as well as more responsive to the needs and aspirations of senior citizens, farmers, small industrialists, entrepreneurs, youth, students, and women. 
A number of innovative suggestions came up during the sessions on how banks may improve the performance and prepare a road map for the future. These would be consolidated and taken up for further discussions at the SLBC/State level."

63,2019-08-20,State Bank,"SBI announces a slew of festive offers for retail banking customers
 State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday announced bouquet of special offerings in this festive season for retail banking customers. 
Customers can avail attractive and cheaper loans with added benefits –waiver in processing fees, pre-approved digital loans and loans with no escalation in interest rates – spread across various categories. 
The move comes amid a general slowdown in consumption growth owing to an overall dip in the macro-economic conditions.
SBI has waived processing fees on car loans during festival season. The bank is offering lowest interest rate starting from 8.70% to customers opting for car loan, with no escalation in interest. For customers applying for a car loan online through Bank’s digital platform like YONO/ Bank’s website, the Bank is providing 25 bps concession on interest rate. The salaried customers can also avail the loan upto 90% of the car’s on-road price.
Recently, SBI has reduced MCLR by 15 bps due to which overall home loan interest rate is now reduced by 35 bps since April 2019. Currently bank offers home loan with interest rate of 8.05% as repo rate linked home loan and this rate will be applicable to all existing and new loan from 1st September. In its latest monetary policy review, the RBI had cut lending rates by 35 basis points.
SBI is offering personal loan upto Rs. 20 lakh at the lowest interest rate starting from 10.75% with the longest re-payment tenure of 6 years, reducing EMI burden on the customers. Additionally, salary account customers can avail pre-approved digital loans upto Rs. 5 lakh through YONO in 4 clicks.
The bank is offering education loan at an attractive rate of interest starting from 8.25% for loan upto Rs. 50 lakh and upto Rs.1.50 crore for studies in India and abroad respectively. Customers will be offered the longest re-payment tenure of 15 years which effectively will reduce their EMI burden."
62,2019-08-20,State Bank,"SBI’s festive offers: Should you go for the bank’s repo-linked home loan?
Ahead of the festive season, SBI has announced a slew of offers for retail loans. Waiver of processing fees on car loans, longer repayment tenure for personal and education loans and attractive interest rates on home, car and personal loans --- are among SBI’s offerings.
But the home loan product that is linked to the repo rate lending rate (RLLR) where the lending rate is linked to the RBI’s repo rate—is one of a kind that catches the eye. It claims to be an attractive offering, as a fall in the RBI’s repo rate in the coming months would immediately translate into lower lending rates for borrowers, as against the existing MCLR structure where transmission happens with a lag.
But how sweet are SBI’s home loan and other deals?
SBI introduced the repo-linked loan product for home loans from July this year. Lending rates are benchmarked against repo rate lending rate (RLLR), which changes every time the RBI tweaks its repo rate. RLLR changes from the 1st of the following month in which the RBI changes its repo rate.
For instance, RLLR was 8 per cent since July. With the RBI’s 35 bps repo rate cut in August, SBI’s RLLR will reduce to 7.65 per cent from September 1.
The effective home loan rate is arrived marking it up by a spread — RLLR+40 bps or RLLR +55 bps (depending on the credit score). Hence for home loans upto Rs 75 lakhs, the effective lending rate for borrowers with good credit score works out to 8.05 per cent currently.
Comparing offers by other banks and even SBI’s own MCLR linked home loan product (effective lending rate of 8.65 per cent), the repo linked home loan appears attractive, as it charges among the lowest lending rate.
But before you opt for it there are other points you need to consider.
Given that any change in repo rate immediately reflects on the lending rate (in the following month), in a scenario where rates are falling, borrowers gain more than under the existing MCLR regime.
Under MCLR, lending rates are reset only at intervals corresponding to the tenure of the MCLR. For instance, in the case of home loans benchmarked against the one-year MCLR, lending rates are reset every year. When the RBI cuts repo rate, banks don’t reduce MCLR immediately. It happens with a lag. Even when MCLR is cut, the benefit of it is transmitted to borrowers only when the loans are reset.
However under SBI’s RLLR, changes to lending rates will happen immediately (within a month).
While in a falling rate cycle, this may be alluring to borrowers, when the RBI’s starts to hike repo rate, borrowers may not be too pleased. Lending rates will go up faster than under the MCLR regime, pinching borrowers more.
Given that home loan is a long tenure product of 25-30 years, there will be many rate cycles---both up and down. So as a borrower, don’t base your decision on the current fall in rates alone.
Under a regular home loan product, one that is linked to your MCLR, your equated monthly instalment (EMI) on your home loan is fairly stable. Given that the reset happens every year there is more predictability in your EMIs. Even when the lending rate is reset based on the latest MCLR, banks usually change the tenure (lower the tenure in case of fall in rates) of your loan rather than EMI---unless you specify otherwise. This in effect keeps your EMI steady.
Under SBI’s RLLR however, a minimum 3 per cent of the principal loan amount should be repaid every year. Interest charged on the loan is serviced monthly, based on the lending rate effective at that point in time. Hence your EMI changes every time there is a change in RBI’s repo rate (in the following month). Given that interest rate cycles have become relatively shorter over the past two to three years, your EMIs could change more frequently. If you prefer predictability of EMIs, then SBI’s product may not be for you.
But remember in a regular home loan product, percentage of principal repaid in the initial years is relatively lower and it increases with the tenure of the loan. In SBI’s RLLR home loan, since the principal repayment is constant over the tenure of the loan, the total interest outgo may be lower, as interest is calculated on the outstanding loan amount, every month. Of course, the movement in interest rates over the tenure of the loan will be a key factor.
Bottomline: While SBI’s new repo linked home loan is an attractive deal at this juncture, consider other factors like predictability of EMIs as well. Remember, you cannot switch between home loans under MCLR and RLLR, for now.
Other deals
Aside from the deal on big ticket home purchase, SBI has also announced other offers for car loans and personal loans to spur spending.
On car loans, the bank has waived off processing fees which is notable benefit for borrowers. ICICI bank currently charges Rs 3500- Rs 8000 processing fee depending on the car segment, while HDFC Bank charges 0.4 per cent of loan amount (minimum of Rs 3000 and maximum of Rs 10000).
Hence savings on processing fees is a tidy amount.
On interest rates, SBI is charging 8.7 per cent for car loan (further 25 bps concession if applies online through the bank’s digital platform), which is also attractive. ICICI bank currently offers car loans for 12.85 per cent for 24-35 months and 9.3 per cent for 36-84 months. HDFC Bank charges interest rate of 9.65-10.6 per cent. There are however few PSU Banks that offer 9 per cent or below on car loans currently.
SBI is also offering personal loans starting from 10.75 per cent with a long re-payment period of 6 years. Most banks usually offer interest rates upwards of 11 per cent, upto a tenure of 5 years. SBI’s personal loan offering thus implies a lower EMI."
61,2019-08-21,State Bank,"SBI plans to establish nearly 10 lakh YONO Cash Points 
 State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, is planning to establish nearly 10 lakh YONO Cash Points in the country over 18 months, said its Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Wednesday.
 The platform is secure and will eliminate the requirement of using debit cards, Kumar said.
“A customer can make bill payments and can do digital transactions by using the YONO cash feature. We are considering establishing close to 10 lakh YONO Cash Points in 18 months. Nearly 70,000 Cash Points have already been established,” he said at a press conference here.
 The bank has no plans to discontinue debit cards but increased use of the digital platform will itself reduce the requirement of the debit cards, he said.
 YONO is a digital banking platform of State Bank of India (SBI) and customers can use it on their smartphones to withdraw cash, make transactions and payments.
 He added that the bank’s new offer about repo rate-linked home loan is getting good response from customers. It is the customers’ choice either to go with the new product or with the MCLR-linked home loan, Kumar added.
 Talking about the slowdown in the automobile sector, he said there are certain trends in the market and they need to be analysed.
“It is an apparent global trend now that people are shifting from vehicle ownership to vehicle rental model due to several reasons like uncertainty of jobs and convenience. The trend should be analysed to figure out how much it is impacting the automobile industry,” he said.
 He also said there was a need to look into the agriculture sector in order to make it commercially viable sector.
“Due to issues in productivity, it sometimes becomes difficult for farmers to repay the loan. The government takes decision for loan waiver but despite the loan waiver, the condition of farmers does not improve, therefore, it should be looked into to ensure that the sector becomes commercially viable and the condition of farmers also improves,” he said.
 The banker also highlighted the advantages of YONO app for the agriculture sector. He said fertilisers, seeds, agriculture tools and equipments can be purchased on reasonable price by using YONO Mandi app."
58,2019-08-23,State Bank,"State Bank cuts term deposit rates for second time this month


In view of the falling interest-rate scenario and surplus liquidity, State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to slash retail domestic term deposit rates by 10-50 basis points (bps), as well as bulk domestic term deposit rates by 30-70 bps across tenors.
India’s largest bank had last cut interest rates for retail domestic term deposits below ₹2 crore and bulk domestic term deposits (₹2 crore and above) by 5-75 basis points across tenors on August 1. 
The sharp cuts in term deposit rates comes in the backdrop of the bank linking its lending rate for a few products (such as cash credit/overdraft customers with effect from May 1, and a new home loan product with effect from July 1) with the repo rate. So, the term deposit rate cut is aimed at protecting the margins.
Following the latest rate cut, the highest interest rate the bank will offer is 6.70 per cent (6.80 per cent currently) for the one-year to less than two-year tenor, for retail domestic term deposits. 
Similarly, in the case of bulk domestic term deposits, the highest interest rate will be 6.40 per cent (6.70 per cent) for the one-year to less than two-year tenor.
However, SBI said it has decided not to reduce the savings bank (SB) interest rate further and hold the same at the existing level of 3 per cent for customers with balance above ₹1 lakh. Customers with SB balance up to ₹1 lakh will continue to get the rate of interest at 3.50 per cent.
Following the RBI’s repo rate cut, SBI cut the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 15 bps across all tenors, with one-year MCLR coming down to 8.25 per cent from 8.40 per cent with effect from August 10."
59,2019-08-23,State Bank,"SBI offers some respite to savings bank depositors amid falling deposit rates
 Has the recent fall in deposit rates pinched you? Then, SBI’s decision to retain its savings deposit rate (for deposits over ₹1 lakh) at 3 per cent should offer you some respite.
The RBI lowered its key policy rate by 35 bps in August. Since then, banks have been lowering fixed deposit and lending rates. But depositors holding SBI savings accounts, had an additional burden to bear. Effective May this year, SBI linked the interest rate on its savings bank deposits (for balances above Rs 1 lakh) with the repo rate — 2.75 per cent below repo rate, retaining 3.5 per cent rate for deposits up to Rs 1 lakh. 
The RBI’s 35 bps reduction in repo rate would have lowered SBI’s savings deposit rate (for balances above Rs 1 lakh) to a very low 2.65 per cent from September. Given that most banks offer 3.5 per cent for their low-value savings deposits (for deposits up to Rs 25-50 lakh), SBI’s meagre rates on savings deposits would have hurt depositors. SBI’s move to retain its existing rate on savings deposits, despite the RBI’s rate cut has, hence, eased the pain.
But for SBI, the decision can lead to earnings volatility as it has linked some of its short-term loans and home loans to the repo rate. No trickle down benefit of lower savings deposit rate, as was expected earlier, could pinch the bank, as it continues to lower its lending rate.
SBI’s decision to not lower rates in its savings deposits would come as a big relief to depositors, who have felt short-changed in the past. While banks are always quick to cut deposit rates in a falling rate cycle, they are somewhat tardy in hiking rates in a rising rate cycle.
But SBI’s move also throws up some questions. Will the bank also exercise this option — to retain rates on savings deposits — in a rising rate scenario? After all, if and when the RBI hikes the repo rate, savings account depositors would hope to gain from SBI’s repo linked product. This is because since the rate on the savings deposit was deregulated in October 2011, banks have not tinkered with the rates -- nearly all banks have kept it at 4 per cent.
It was only in July 2017, for the first time, that SBI moved to lower the rate on savings deposits to 3.5 per cent, with other banks quickly following suit.
But in 2018, when rates started to rise, SBI and other banks did not revise the savings deposit rates up. It appeared that depositors, who were stuck with a meagre 4 per cent rate for over half-a-decade, would continue to be stuck with lower rates (of 3.5 per cent) for another long period of time.
SBI’s move to link its savings deposit to the repo rate in May, could have resolved the issue of cartelisation, as depositors hoped that the bank would also hike savings deposit rates now, if and when RBI hikes rate.
But with SBI’s decision to retain rates (though beneficial for savers), it is uncertain what it would do in a rising rate cycle.
Could hurt earnings
Along with savings deposits, SBI also linked its short-term loans to the RBI’s repo rate in May this year. It also introduced a repo-linked home loan product in July. 
Repricing some of its deposits (savings) with every RBI rate action, would have helped cushion the earnings volatility arising on account of pegging some of its lending rates to the repo rate.
This is because, when lending rates are pegged to external benchmarks, it would imply faster reset of loan rates. This would mean that banks will have to create a portfolio of deposits and loans with a balanced mix across tenors such that the overall asset-liability gaps are managed well, not only to reduce liquidity mismatches but also to mitigate earnings volatility.
While one way to do this would be to take more short-term deposits that get repriced faster, it could lead to a liquidity gap. The other way would be to develop floating rate fixed deposits, with which banks have had little success until now.
By linking savings deposit rates to an external benchmark — repo rate — SBI had sought to resolve the dilemma. For large banks such as SBI, the savings deposits form 25-35 per cent of deposits. Repricing them faster can lead to notable gains on cost of funds in a rate cut scenario, aiding better transmission to lending rates without hurting earnings much.
It needs to be seen how the SBI’s decision to not lower its savings deposit rate, which could have mitigated earnings volatility, impacts the bank."

57,2019-08-26,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI can face resistance ahead
After taking a breather in the week earlier, SBI resumed its fall and tumbled 6.8 per cent last week. Though there is a possibility to see a near-term corrective bounce, the broader picture remains weak. A strong resistance at ₹280 can cap the rally. A consolidation between ₹260 and ₹280 for a week cannot be ruled out. The indicators on the charts remain bearish, keeping the doors open for further fall. The 21-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average — a bearish cross-over indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, SBI is likely to keep the downtrend intact and break below ₹260 in the coming days. Such a break can take the stock initially lower to ₹250-245. A further break below ₹245 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to ₹230. The broad region between ₹240 and ₹230 is a strong support zone which can halt the current downtrend. A corrective rally, thereafter, to ₹270-280 cannot be ruled out. But a strong break below ₹230 will increase the possibility of the stock tumbling further to ₹190-180 over the medium term.










ITC breaks crucial long-term support
ITC is under pressure. The stock plummeted 6.8 per cent last week. This sharp fall has dragged the stock well below the crucial long-term support level of ₹240. We will have to wait and see if ITC sustains below ₹240 and confirms the break. It has to reverse sharply higher and close decisively above ₹243 to get a breather. In such scenario, the chances of seeing a further fall will get reduced, and a corrective rally to ₹255 and ₹260 is possible. But an inability to bounce above ₹243 can take ITC lower to the next key support level of ₹228.5. If it manages to hold above this support, it can consolidate between ₹228 and ₹243 for some time. But as long as ITC trades below ₹243, it will remain under pressure. An eventual break below ₹228.5 will confirm the break of the long-term uptrend and intensify the fall further. Such a break will see the stock tumbling further towards the next major support levels of ₹211 and ₹207. It will also keep the possibilities high of the stock extending the fall even up to ₹200 and ₹190.










Infosys to remain range-bound
Infosys broke the ₹755-805 range on the upside last week, but failed to sustain higher. The stock made a high of ₹809.95 and came off slightly from there to close just below the upper end of the ₹755-805 range. The stock was up 3.5 per cent last week. A strong break and a decisive close above ₹805 are needed to confirm the range breakout. A key support is at ₹789. As long as Infosys remains above this support, there is a strong likelihood of the stock breaking the range above ₹805. Such a break will boost the momentum and take the stock higher to ₹850 and ₹870 in the coming weeks. But if the stock remains below ₹805, a narrow range-bound move between ₹789 and ₹805 is possible in the near term. A break below ₹789 will reduce the chances of the stock breaching ₹805. Such a break will see an initial dip to ₹785. A further break below ₹785 will then strengthen the downmove and drag the stock lower to ₹768 and ₹763. In that case, the ₹755-805 range will continue to remain intact.










 
Near-term outlook is unclear for RIL
RIL fell sharply by 4 per cent intra-week to make a low of ₹1,226.8. However, it managed to claw back on Friday, recovering all the loss. RIL has been stuck in a sideways range between ₹1,225 and ₹1,304 over the past couple of weeks. This leaves the near-term outlook mixed. As mentioned last week, RIL can consolidate sideways between ₹1,215 and ₹1,305. A breakout on either side of ₹1,215 or ₹1,305 will determine the direction of the next move. Though the strong bounce on Friday keeps the bias positive, weakness in the broader markets may play spoil sport. As such, the possibility of the stock declining below ₹1,215 in the coming days cannot be ruled out. Such a break will bring renewed pressure on the stock and increase the chances of it revisiting ₹1,150 and ₹1,100 levels in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if RIL breaks above ₹1,305 decisively, it will gain fresh momentum. In such a scenario, the stock can surge to ₹1,400. An eventual break above ₹1,400 will then pave way for a further rally to ₹1,480 over the medium term.










The downtrend remains intact in Tata Steel. The stock tumbled 5 per cent last week. It has plummeted over 30 per cent over the last eight weeks. The support in the ₹330-320 zone mentioned last week is holding well as of now. But the indicators on the charts are bearish. The 21-week moving average is on the verge of crossing below the 200-week moving average. This is a negative signal indicating that the upside could be limited. As such, it can continue to remain under pressure and any intermediate bounce could be short-lived. An immediate resistance is in the ₹353-355 region which can cap the upside in the near term and keep the stock under pressure. An eventual break below ₹320 will see the fall extending to ₹300 and even lower going forward. Also, as being reiterated in this column over the past few weeks, the current downtrend — which has been in place since 2018 — looks strong. It has the potential to drag Tata Steel lower to ₹250-230 in the coming months.

Arijit Basu,MD, SBI


The State Bank of India said it is well-capitalised, and that it may not require any fresh funds from the government this financial year.
On Friday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced an immediate infusion of Rs 70,000 crore into state-run banks to boost liquidity and their lending capacity by Rs 5 lakh crore.
The government had planned a staggered infusion earlier, but the rising tide of bad news on the economy forced its hand to open the purse-strings earlier.
“For SBI, we are not looking at any recapitalisation right now as we are well-capitalised as we have been able to raise from markets. We have also announced our programme for both Tier-I and Tier-II bonds,” Managing Director Arijit Basu told reporters on the sidelines of an event organised by the industry lobby Indian Chamber of Commerce.
He said the upfront capital infusion will be for those banks which are not in shape to access the market immediately.
Basu said SBI is also looking selling its investment in non-core assets to raise capital.
Earlier this month, SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar had said the bank would move ahead with the IPO for SBI Cards in Q4, and would delay a share sale in the general insurance arm to next fiscal year. “We have already announced that SBI Cards IPO. We are also looking at some of the other subsidiaries. It is working according to the plan. That is one of the measures by which capital will be coming in,” Basu said.
Commenting on the recent announcements by the government to boost the sagging growth, Basu said that it shows that the government is serious and it wants to understand what are the views of the industry and is also ready to positively respond to them."

 SBI Card will soon launch RuPay credit cards, a development which will give a boost to the homegrown payment network in the fast growing segment.
 Presently, the credit card segment is dominated by the US-based payment gateways like Visa and Mastercard.
 RuPay is the first-of-its-kind domestic debit and credit card payment network of India developed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an umbrella organisation for operating retail payments and settlement systems.

“We will be (launching RuPay based credit card) soon. There is a last agreement that is left out at the end of NPCI level. I think NPCI is going to send it any day and we will be launching some products,” SBI Card MD and CEO Hardayal Prasad said in an interview to PTI.
 Expressing confidence that RuPay credit card will be launched in this fiscal only, Prasad said, “It’s just a matter of time. The Rupay will become very popular and will be used in India aggressively. I have no doubts on it“.
He said that there is a big “nationalistic segment” which is insisting on RuPay cards. About one-third of the cards being issued by India’s largest lender State Bank of India are RuPay cards, he said.
“There are class of customers who want RuPay card. There are those nationalistic people who say ‘give us only Rupay cards’ So I am very upbeat,” he said.
 The company may issue both RuPay as well as Visa/Mastercard to its customers, specially who travel abroad, Prasad said.
As of now, RuPay cards are accepted only in few countries, including Singapore and Bhutan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently launched the card in UAE.
 RuPay has also tied-up with international players like Discover, Japan Credit Bureau and China Union Pay to enhance its international acceptance.
 Prasad further said that SBI Card has rolled out its chatbot ‘ILA’ (Interactive Live Assistant) on its mobile app to further enhance consumer experience.
 ILA has 40 plus innovative features making SBI Card one of the first in the industry to offer a complete suite of self-service functionalities increasing convenience for the customers, he said.
“Since its release, SBI Card’s chatbot has successfully resolved over 14 million queries with over 97 per cent accuracy,” he added.
 SBI Card had 90 lakh customers at end-July with a market share of 17.9 per cent.
 According to Prasad, the company has been adding 3 lakh cards per month since December 2018."

The Country’s largest public sector bank -- State Bank of India -- sought issuance of 147 look out circulars (LoC) in the last five months in connection with bank fraud cases, an RTI response from the bank said.
Data shows that the bank started seeking LoC from the Bureau of Immigration from April this year.
Between April and August, it issued request seeking LoC against 147 individuals to prevent them from leaving the country, the bank said in response to a Right to Information query filed by Pune-based activist Vihar Durve said.

On October 12, 2018, the Home Ministry included Chairman, Chief Executive Officers and Managing Directors of public sector banks in the list of individuals who can seek issuance of Look Out Circulars against offenders to prevent their escape from the country, it said.
According to data provided in Parliament in December last year, about 49 economic offenders have escaped to different countries and the government is making attempts to bring them back.

Fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya, diamantaire Mehul Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi, industrialists Nitin and Chetan Sandesara are among 58 economic offenders probed by the CBI, Enforcement Directorate and other agencies who have escaped abroad, it says.
Although top officials of public sector bank were empowered last year to seek issuance of LoC against individuals, relevant guidelines were framed by the Indian Banks’ Association in March this year, the Association told Durve.
The guidelines were considered necessary after public sector banks approached the Association seeking legal protection and immunity available to police and the CBI while issuing the LoCs, it said.
Durve had approached the Finance Ministry seeking to know details about the request for issuance of LoC received from various authorities between 2017 and 2019, action taken on them among other things.
The Finance Ministry transferred the application to the Home Ministry and Public Sector Banks to furnish the information.
The Home Ministry then transferred the application to the Bureau of Immigration (BOI), which works under the Intelligence Bureau. The BOI sought refuge from disclosure under the Section 24 of the RTI Act which exempts it from the ambit of the transparency law.
In FY19, the banking sector reported 6,801 frauds involving ₹71,542.93 crore as against 5,916 cases involving ₹41,167.04 crore reported in 2017-18, the Reserve Bank of India has said in its latest report.
Among bank groups, PSBs, which have the largest market share in terms of lending, accounted for the majority of frauds reported in 2018-19. It was followed by private sector banks and foreign banks.

In the reporting year, state-run banks reported 3,766 cases of frauds worth ₹64,509.43 crore. The report said that the average lag between the date of occurrence of frauds and its detection by banks was 22 months.
The average lag for large frauds, i.e. ₹100 crore and above, amounting to ₹52,200 crore reported during 2018-19, was 55 months,” it said.
Cheating and forgery were the major component, followed by misappropriation and criminal breach of trust. Fraud cases involving an amount of less than ₹1 lakh (i.e., small-value frauds) were only 0.1% of the total amount involved in 2018-19, the report showed."

State Bank of India, India’s largest lender, is “examining” a proposal from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to lend as much as ₹ 35,000 crore through securitisation of toll receipts to part-fund highway projects this year, Chairman Rajnish Kumar has said.
“We are examining NHAI’s proposal to raise funds through securitisation of toll proceeds. We are looking at ₹ 30,000-35,000 crore, but not all of that will be funded by SBI,” Kumar told BusinessLine on the sidelines of a road show organized by NHAI on Monday.
“NHAI has huge cash flows. We are ready to give money to whoever needs it. It depends on how much and which route/model needs money,” he said.
Part of NHAI borrowings this fiscal could also be funded by LIC and EPFO, a top LIC official said. During the last three years, the state-run insurer has lent about ₹25,000 crore to NHAI for a 30-years tenure, the LIC official said adding that being an insurer with long-term funds, LIC was not handicapped by the asset-liability mismatch which banks typically face in funding long-gestation infrastructure projects.
Road Transport & Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said that NHAI will securitise/monetise toll receipts from projects and raise funds.
“We have prepared a proposal to raise long-term loans by securitising toll proceeds. My proposal was for 30 years, but the SBI chairman has reduced it to 20 years. We can raise ₹100,000 to ₹ 150,000 crore from SBI alone and from other banks also we can go for a similar arrangement. It is a secured thing, NHAI has AAA rating,” Gadkari said during the road show in Mumbai.
“Currently, NHAI is tolling about 12,000 km and another 1,300 km of BOT Toll highways will be transferred back to us by FY22,” said Ashish Sharma, Member (Finance) NHAI.
“The toll collections from these projects are very high; our toll income will increase to about ₹4,000 crore a year when these BOT Toll projects as returned to us at the end of the concession period,” Gadkari stated.
“Toll is never going to end. Even after the cost has been recovered from the projects, the toll collection will continue. NHAI getting toll income in perpetuity is a very good proposition,” Gadkari said.
“If banks are convinced about the cash flows of highway projects, what is their net present value (NPV), then funding is not an issue. At least from SBI, we have been supporting the programme of NHAI, whether it is the Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) and securitisation. We are willing to put the money,” Rajnish Kumar said.
The tenure also can be taken care of through a refinancing structure where we need not commit for 20 years, it is not necessary that the loan has to be refinanced every five years, banks can manage their asset-liability through a suitable structure.
NHAI’s Sharma said that the agency would be coming out with its infrastructure investment trusts or InvITs. “That is something which has been proposed and we are waiting for cabinet approval which is expected by the middle of this month,” Sharma said adding that NHAI will also raise funds through masala bonds this year.
“We can also participate in infrastructure investment trusts, but that is something which is still under the consideration of the Reserve bank of India (RBI),” SBI’s Kumar said.
“As of now money is available and road sector is probably the only sector where at least good investment is happening,” Kumar said, advising NHAI to put safeguards in place while re-introducing the BOT Toll model for highway development.
“In the past, the BOT Toll model has not succeeded for various reasons. When the policy (revised BOT Toll model) comes, at that stage we will examine and see what would be our response. But, when you do BOT Toll projects, keep EPC contractors out of it. They should only construct not operate, it has been a very bad experience,” he added."

46,2019-09-14,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide
SBI (₹291.7)
After trading within a range, SBI began to head north and gained throughout the week, breaking above the critical resistance at ₹280. In fact, it was the biggest weekly gain for the stock in the past 16 weeks, moving up by 6.5 per cent. The weekly chart of SBI shows a morning star candlestick pattern, indicating a potential reversal in the medium-term trend. The stock has also moved past its 21-day moving average, which also indicates strongbuying interest in the past week. The daily relative strength index has crossed the mid-point level of 50 after nearly two months, and the moving average convergence divergence indicator also points upwards, implying considerable strength in the bullish trend. Assuming that the prevailing bullish sentiment will help the stock go up further, breaking a resistance at ₹292 will help the stock move towards the ₹300 levels and beyond in the medium term. But if the stock witnesses profit-booking or reacts to the resistance and slides lower, it might decline to ₹288 levels, below which the support is at ₹280.
 










 
ITC (₹239.9)
ITC continues to be held within the ₹240-247 limits. After testing the upper limit of the range at ₹247 — where the 21-day moving average level too coincides — failed to break above and corrected from that level towards the lower limit of the range at ₹240. Most of the decline was during the last two trading sessions, when the stock lost 1.6 per cent. The daily relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator remains flat, implying a lack of trend. Hence, unless the stock breaks either of the limits of the consolidation range, it is better to stay away from initiating new positions. If the weakness in the latter part of the previous week pulls down the price of the scrip further and it goes below ₹240, the immediate support lies at ₹236. If the stock declines below ₹236, the sell-off could intensify and the price might tumble to ₹224 levels. Alternatively, a bounce from the current level will result in the stock inching up towards ₹247 in the upcoming week, beyond which it will face a resistance in the band between ₹250 and ₹252 levels.
 










 
Infosys (₹829.3)
The stock of Infosys could not continue its uptrend. The stock corrected in the past week when the price dropped to a low of ₹810.85, after opening the week a bit lower at ₹836.80 against ₹840.15 — its previous week close. The stock was supported by 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bullish swing at ₹814. And, on Friday, the stock recovered some of its losses as it opened the session at ₹818.65 and closed higher at ₹829.3 levels. The scrip still trades above 21-day moving average, thereby not posing any immediate threat to the prevailing bullish trend. The relative strength index continue to feature in bullish zone. Hence, if the stock regains the momentum and goes up, it will most likely appreciate towards a lifetime high at ₹847 and even to ₹875 levels in medium term. On the other hand, if the stock is weighed down by factors such as profit-booking or a stronger rupee, it is most likely to drift towards the support band between ₹800 and ₹804 — the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of previous swing in the coming week.
 










 
RIL (₹1225.6)
Reliance Industries continues to trade within a tight range — between ₹1,200 and ₹1,240. The upside for the stock is blocked by the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, essentially lying in the same price area, near the ₹1,240 levels. A prolonged consolidation might reduce the significance of both the moving averages, unless the stock moves out of the band. . The relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator plotted on the daily chart of the stock stay direction-less, failing to provide any clue about the upcoming trend. So, until the stock breaks out of the tight price range within which it is oscillating, it might prove costly to make any directional bets. In case the stock moves up buoyed by the positive sentiment in the equity benchmarks and breaches ₹1,240, it is very likely that the price will appreciate to ₹1,300 levels, thereby moving past both the moving average, which may also push RSI above 50. However, if the stock breaks the lower boundary of the range, immediate support is at ₹1,180 and ₹1,140 thereafter.
 










Tata Steel (₹367.35)
Tata Steel edged up last week and closed with a weekly gain of 3.4 per cent. Thus, the share price of the steel major has posted gains for the second consecutive week. The stock has moved beyond the 21-day moving average, as it witnessed some buying interest in the past two weeks. On Friday, the scrip, after opening at ₹367.05, closed the day at ₹367.35 — the 38 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend. Though the stock made a high of ₹379.5 on Thursday, it could not hold on, declining and closing the session at ₹365.05, witnessing some selling pressure. Daily candle on Thursday is a shooting star pattern, meaning there are chances for reversal in the trend. The relative strength index too is nearing the mid-point of 50, and a decisive break above that level may help the stock appreciate further towards ₹395 levels. On the other hand, if the stock price depreciates from the current levels, it will most probably retest ₹350 — the 21-day moving average — below which it could tumble to ₹330 levels."

The largest lender State Bank of India has dropped its plan to take its general insurance arm public as there is no need for additional capital now, chairman Rajnish Kumar has said.
Investor interest for its cards business is very high, and SBI Card listing will happen in the March quarter, he said.
The bank was earlier looking for an IPO for SBI General Insurance in FY21.
When asked if the IPO for general insurance will happen next fiscal, Kumar replied in the negative, saying there is no need for capital.
SBI General, valued at over ₹12,000 crore recently, is a joint venture between SBI and Insurance Australia Group with a 26 per cent ownership.
On the additional stake sale in SBI Life, Kumar explained that the bank is required to offload an additional 2 per cent stake as per the SEBI norms, but has time till October 2020 to execute the same.
About the SBI Card IPO, he said the feelers from investors suggest that they are excited to invest in the company.
The IPO will be launched in the January-March quarter of the current fiscal and based on the valuation arrived at, SBI will take a call on the stake sale, he said.
SBI owns 74 per cent in the cards venture, while its foreign partner can also choose to dilute its stake through the IPO (initial public offering), Kumar said."
44,2019-09-15,State Bank,"SBI to seek clarity from Reserve Bank on fixed-floating home loan rate
The largest lender State Bank of India will be seeking clarifications from the Reserve Bank whether it can offer long-term home loans with fixed rates in the beginning and convert the same into floating rates later, chairman Rajnish Kumar has said.
The move comes after the Reserve Bank has mandated banks to shift all retail lending to floating rates that will be determined by external benchmarks like the repo rate.
Kumar said there is a lack of clarity on how it can go ahead with the fixed-rate products, after the RBI’s new regulations on floating rates.
Hinting at the volatility in the repo rate, he said some home buyers may want their loan rates to be fixed.
For such buyers, it can offer a ‘fixed-floating’ product, wherein the rates are locked in for an initial period of say five to ten years, and then turns floating.
The need for making the product floating in the latter part arises out of the bank’s inability to project the liability movements in the future, he said, adding typically, home loans are for about 30 years.
It can be noted that the repo rate at which the central bank lends to the system is at a nine-year low of 5.40 per cent.
Speaking to reporters here over the weekend, Kumar said the central bank’s recent guidelines on floating rate products for the retail segment has necessitated the need for the clarity.
Kumar has clarified that from an asset-liability management perspective, it is difficult to have a fixed rate product for a long term like 30 years, the maximum tenor of a home loan now from the bank now. Some private-sector peers offer up to 35 years of home loans depending on in the age of the borrower, though.
At present, SBI has a floating rate home loan product linked to its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate and it recently withdrew one linked to the repo rate. It does not have a fixed rate home loan product at present.
As of now, under the marginal cost of funds based lending, floating-rate loans are re-set as when the interest rates fall or rise, but fixed-rate loans are reset in 9-12 months. But when the loans are linked to the repo rate, the rates can change sharply, depending on how RBI acts on the rate front.
Many mortgage borrowers normally choose fixed rates, as that helps them better manage their finances because of the certainty about the EMI outgoes.
Kumar said the bank does not have adequate liabilities linked to the floating rate which makes such a floating product difficult.
Speaking on the RBI-mandated systemic shift to external benchmarked lending rates, he said SBI will have minimal issues with the same.
He said the industry leader was the first to move on to the repo-linked loans and deposits since May and has many of its products aligned to the external benchmarks now.
However, he said such shifts make asset-liability management “challenging” as there lack of floating-rate liabilities now.
About the impact of the megabank mergers on SBI, he said it will not impact the nation’s largest bank as SBI has specified business model and target segments, and will continue with the same."

SBI (₹301.7)
SBI began the week marginally lower at ₹288.2 compared with the previous week close of ₹291.7. The stock declined further to ₹273 levels during the earlier part of the week. However, on Friday, it surged with huge volumes and closed the day with 10 per cent gain. It also moved past resistances at ₹292 and ₹300, closing the week at ₹301.7, posting a considerable weekly gain of 3.4 per cent. Before moderating to ₹301.7, the stock registered a high of ₹307.65, where the 50-day moving average lies. There’s a resistance in the band between ₹305.1 — the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level — and ₹307.65. With the daily relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicator pointing upwards and the stock breaking above ₹300, the current rally may continue to push the stock price up to ₹318 and then to ₹320 levels. Alternatively, if the stock slides down after testing the resistance band between ₹307.65 and ₹305.1, it might decline to ₹292 levels.










ITC (₹238.05)
ITC, the stock price of which has been trading in a range between ₹240 and ₹247, declined below the lower limit on Tuesday. The stock retested a support at ₹234.65, from where the price attempted to recover twice in the past one month. However, on both occasions, the recovery was blocked by resistance at ₹247. As a result, the stock seems to have formed a broader range between ₹234.65 and ₹247. Even on Friday, after appreciating to the resistance at ₹247, the stock could not hold on and gave up most of its gains towards the end of the session. The scrip closed the week at ₹238.05. Hence, for the stock to start trending, it must either decisively break above ₹247 or below ₹234.6. In case the stock attracts buying interest and moves past the resistance at ₹247, it may appreciate towards the resistance band between ₹250 and ₹252. But if the stock slips below ₹234, the sell-off could intensify and the price might tumble to ₹224 levels.










Infosys (₹805)
The stock of Infosys was consolidating for the week after a mute opening on Monday. But on Friday, the stock price of the IT major slumped and it lost 1.9 per cent during the session. It closed below 21-day moving average, indicating a potential reversal in short-term trend. With a close at ₹805, the stock has also breached a support at ₹814, where the 38.2 per cent of Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bullish swing coincides. Currently, the fall is arrested by a support in the band between ₹800 and ₹804. The relative strength index has crossed below the mid-point of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence too shows weakness, indicating further depreciation. Hence, if the price breaks below ₹800, it could fall to the support at ₹793, where the important 61.8 Fibonacci retracement level coincides. The 50-day moving average is at ₹792, making that price area a significant support. But if the price recovers from the current level, it may rally to ₹814.










RIL (₹1254.35)
The stock price of Reliance Industries was trading without showing any trend till Thursday. However, on Friday, after making an intra-day low of ₹1,174.3, the stock price rose rapidly and closed at ₹1254.35. Intra-day gain of the stock stood at 6.4 per cent. It registered an intra-day high of ₹1,269.9, which is also the month-to-date high. That way, it has breached a considerable resistance at ₹1,240. The stock has also zoomed past both the 21- and 50-day moving averages. Hence, the prevailing positive sentiment opens the door for the stock to appreciate towards ₹1,300, which is a key level from a medium-term perspective. This is because beyond ₹1,300, the stock has the potential to turn the medium-term trend bullish. Alternatively, in a less likely scenario where the stock moderates from the current levels, the price band between ₹1,230 and ₹1,240 will act as a solid support, limiting the correction. The probability of the price declining below these levels is low.










Tata Steel (₹368.55)
The share price of Tata Steel looked unsteady as it began the week at ₹362 and slid to ₹342 levels, moving below the support at ₹350. On Friday though, on the back of broad-based buying, the stock price went up, reclaiming the previous week high of ₹379.5. Interestingly, the stock faced selling pressure towards the close of Friday’s session, giving up some of its gains and wrapped up for the week at ₹368.5. Comparing this with ₹367.3 — the previous week closing price — there is essentially not much change. Hence, it is reiterated that a close above ₹380 is a prerequisite for the stock to move to higher levels. Noticeably, both the relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator point upwards, indicating a build-up in positive sentiment. In such a case, the stock may appreciate to ₹395, beyond which it will face a hurdle at ₹400. But, if the stock is sold off from the current levels, it may decline to ₹350."

PO26_SENIORS




PO26_SENIORS


 In view of the declining interest scenario, the government should consider exempting interest earned by senior citizens under SCSS from income tax as the fiscal cost would be minimal, a SBI study said on Tuesday.
 Under the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS), a senior citizen can deposit up to Rs 15 lakh and the current interest rate is 8.6 per cent. The tenure of this scheme is five years with the option to extend it for three more years. However, the interest on SCSS is fully taxable, which is a major drawback of this scheme (the interest amount for Rs 1 lakh deposit for 5 years is around Rs 51,000 which is taxable).
 “It will be fair if such amount is given full tax rebate as the revenue foregone by the government could be only Rs 3,092 crore, that will have the minimal 2 bps impact on government fiscal deficit,” said the SBI Ecowrap report.
 Most of the banks, including SBI, have been reducing interest on fixed deposits in tandem with the Reserve Bank of India’s decision to slash its policy rate (repo), which will have a bearing on interest income of senior citizens.
 With the RBI mandating banks to link lending rates to external benchmark from October 1, the stage is now set for instantaneous transmission of change in repo rate to lending rates."

The State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday said it will slash term deposit (TD) rates by up to 25 basis points and also reduce its marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points (bps) across all tenors with effect from September 10. 
India's largest bank has effected a steeper cut in deposit rates vis-a-vis MCLR probably to protect its margins. It attributed the realignment in interest rate on TDs to the falling interest rate scenario and surplus liquidity. Retail TD rates and bulk TD rates have been revised downwards by by 20-25 bps and 10-20 bps across tenors, respectively. 
One basis point equals one-hunderedth of a percentage point. 
New rates
Following the rate cut, the highest interest rate that the bank will offer will be 6.50 per cent (6.70 per cent now) on retail domestic TDs (below Rs 2 crore) in the one year to less than two years maturity bucket. 
In the case of domestic bulk TDs (above Rs 2 crore), the highest interest rate that SBI will offer will be 6.30 per cent (6.40 per cent now) in the one year to less than two years maturity bucket. 
Following the rate cut, the 1 Year MCLR will come down to 8.15 per cent from 8.25 per cent. 
SBI, in  a statement, this is the fifth consecutive cut in MCLR in FY 2019-20. All rupee loans sanctioned and credit limits renewed by banks with effect from April 1, 2016 are priced with reference to MCLR, which will be the internal benchmark for such purposes."

39,2019-09-29,State Bank,"Weekly trading guide










 
SBI opened the week strongly at ₹307.5 against the previous close of ₹301.7, up nearly 2 per cent. The stock appreciated further to a high of ₹316, briefly trading above the 50-day moving average. However, the stock reversed abruptly as it could not sustain the bullish momentum and the price began to decline, breaking below the key supports at ₹300 and ₹292.
Thus, the near-term outlook seems weak as rallies are sold-off. The relative strength index has dipped below the 50-mark, indicating weakness. On the downside, supports are at ₹273.7 and ₹267. Resistances are at ₹292 and ₹300. The next leg of trend can be expected only if the stock price breaks either to ₹300 or ₹267.
In case it goes above ₹300, the stock will face a hurdle at the resistance band between ₹305.1 and ₹307.6, beyond which it may potentially retest the ₹316 levels. But if the stock breaks below ₹267, the sell-off could intensify and the stock will most likely tumble to ₹260. The return last week was minus 6.2 per cent.










 
The stock price of ITC took a huge leap as it opened the week at ₹250 against the previous close of ₹238.05, which is a solid 5 per cent gain. It extended the rally and went on to make a high of ₹260.5. However, the stock could not move beyond that level and the price started to soften and slumped to ₹242.7, from where it bounced off from the 21-day moving average support.
Studying the chart, one can observe that the stock is consolidating sideways as the price oscillates in the band between ₹247 and the resistance band ₹258-260. If the stock manages to breach the upper limit of the range at ₹260, it is likely that it will appreciate towards ₹270 levels, beyond which there’s an immediate resistance at ₹273.
However, if the stock weakens and slides below the lower limit of the range, that is, ₹247, the price may depreciate to ₹240, below which it can even drop to ₹234 levels. Last week’s return was plus 6.5 per cent.










 
Infosys witnessed considerable selling immediately after the previous week opened. As a result, it tumbled below the key level at ₹800. A stronger rupee weighed down the stock. The fall extended to ₹741.9 before the stock recouped some if its losses, closing the week at ₹782.
Recoveries are strongly resisted by the price band between ₹793 and ₹800. Hence, the near-term outlook remains weak. It has also moved below the 50-day moving average, potentially shifting the medium-term trend to bearish. The RSI has dipped below the 50 midpoint and the moving average convergence divergence indicator too appears weak. So, if the scrip weakens below ₹781, it will most likely depreciate to ₹762.
A break below that level can intensify the bearish trend and the stock could dwindle to ₹725 levels. Alternatively, if the stock manages to post a recovery beyond the stiff resistance at ₹800, there will be a minor resistance at ₹814, beyond which it might move northwards to ₹850 levels over the medium term.










 
Following the bullish momentum, the stock price of Reliance Industries continued to gain throughout last week. The stock toppled the key resistance at ₹1,300, making the case stronger for further appreciation. The relative strength index is clearly favouring the bulls and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has come into the positive territory, denoting a strong prevailing uptrend.
Also, the stock price has broken above the falling trend-line resistance. The stock has posted gains for two consecutive weeks. All these imply that the stock is on a strong bull trend and is likely to continue appreciating in the coming sessions.
On the upside, the stock will face a minor resistance at ₹1,320, beyond which it could strengthen to ₹1,365 levels in the near term. On the other hand, if the stock undergoes a correction, ₹1,300 will act as a key immeidate support, below which the price could fall to ₹1,240 in the short term. The return last week was plus 4.4 per cent.










 
The share price of Tata Steel was consolidating last week, fluctuating between ₹360 and ₹380. Though the stock attempted to move past ₹380, it failed, as it was rejected by the 50-day moving average. Thus, the broader ₹345-380 range continues to control the trend.
The moving average convergence divergence indicator implies weakness and so is the relative strength index. But since the RSI remains in over-sold conditions, the chances of a major downtrend from the current levels stand reduced. But unless the stock invalidates the range, the direction of the next major trend will be indecisive. Hence, the near-term outlook seems sluggish.
If the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range, it may rise towards the resistance band between ₹395 and ₹400. Beyond those levels, it can move upwards to ₹440. But, if the stock breaches below ₹345, the support is at ₹330, below which the stock could test the psychological level of ₹300."

State Bank of India opened its Melbourne office on Monday, becoming the first Indian bank to have a branch in the Australian state of Victoria.
The Melbourne office will assist the growing trade and investment relations between Victoria and India and is the outcome of the state’s 10-year India Strategy — our shared future, according to a press release.
Speaking at the inauguration here, Victoria’s parliamentary secretary to the treasurer, Steve Dimopoulos, said, “We are delighted to welcome SBI to Victoria — the first Indian bank to set up operations in our State.”
“This investment by India’s largest commercial bank is a testament to our thriving financial services sector and our highly skilled workforce,” he said.
According to official figures, the two-way merchandise trade between Victoria and India was to the tune of Australian $1.76 billion in 2018.
SBI Managing Director Dinesh Kumar Khara said “It is a great privilege to have our presence in the vibrant and business-friendly city of Melbourne. I am confident that our footprint in Melbourne will further strengthen the relationship between the two countries”
Victoria already has the presence of leading Indian businesses, including Cipla, Cyient, HCL, Infosys, Ramco, Samvardhana Motherson Group, TCS, Tech Mahindra, Ugam Solutions, Wipro, Zoonga and Zomato.
Victoria’s financial sector employs more than 122,000 and generates around A$40 billion every year."
37,2019-10-06,State Bank,"SBI: Repo rate cut dims outlook
Investors in banking stocks turned nervous last week amid fears of earnings taking a hit from another repo rate cut.
Among banks, SBI was the worst hit — down 11.15 per cent — last week. This is because public sector banks already offer significantly lower rates on deposits. The repo rate cut on Friday has only made matters worse. That apart, with the new repo rate-linked loans, loan rates are set to reset faster for the bank. Hence, not passing on the repo rate cut to depositors will still leave a dent on the earnings.
 








 
 
But to keep a check on earnings volatility, the bank has launched repo rate-linked deposits. However, it may not entirely mitigate the risk of lower earnings. Besides, the cut in growth forecast by the RBI was not taken positively by the investors as lower growth, coupled with the accommodative stance being maintained, is indicative of more cuts in the upcoming meetings."

SBI in a strong bear grip (₹249.9)
The stock posted some recovery in the month of September by appreciating to ₹315 levels. However, the rally did not sustain, and the stock fell sharply from that level. During the past week, the price even slumped below a critical support at ₹267 and closed at ₹249.9, indicating that the next leg of trend is on the downside. The stock has been continuously falling and has registered back-to-back weekly loss. The daily relative strength index is below the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has entered the negative territory, meaning there might be more selling pressure. An immediate support is at ₹246. Below that, the sell-off could intensify, potentially dragging the price to the support band between ₹230 and ₹233. On the upside, the stock will face resistance at ₹260. If the stock manages to get past that level, it might move towards ₹267. Considering the scenario, traders can sell the stock on rallies with a stop-loss above ₹267. The stock posted a weekly loss of 11 per cent.
 










 
ITC holds on to its gain (₹257.2)
There was not much volatility in the ITC stock last week. The stock briefly traded beyond the ₹247-260 range, but eventually moved back into the range after facing a hurdle at ₹263 — 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bear trend. The stock has closed in the green for the second week in a row, though the gain was marginal. It should also be noted that the stock continues to trade above both the 21- and 50-day moving averages, implying a bullish bias. The daily relative strength index is above the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence indicator looks steady in favour of the bulls. The stock seems to be trading with a bullish bias. However, the price might soften further before breaking on the upside. Hence, one can initiate long positions either at ₹250 levels or beyond ₹260 with a stop-loss below the lower boundary of the range at ₹247. Look for target between ₹270 and ₹273, which is a considerable resistance zone. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1.7 per cent.
 










 
Infosys moves in sideways range (₹793.4)
The price action of Infosys stock is sluggish and seems to be trading sideways. The stock attempted to break above the critical resistance at ₹800 but failed . Noticeably, the price has been oscillating between ₹781 and ₹800 for the past seven trading sessions. Also, it could not move past the dynamic 50-day moving average resistance which is currently coinciding with the resistance at ₹800, making it more significant. Unless the stock invalidates the sideways trend, the next leg of the trend will be unclear. The moving average convergence divergence indicator is showing signs of weakness, but the relative strength index seems to be recovering. However, only a breakout beyond ₹800 will take the stock price higher. If it gets past ₹800, it will face a minor resistance at ₹814. Above that, the price could rally towards ₹850 . Alternatively, if stock price dips below ₹781, it will decline further to ₹762. A break below ₹762 will intensify sell-off and the stock price could dwindle to ₹740 level. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1.4 per cent.
 










 
Reliance above key support (₹1,308.1)
The share price of Reliance Industries did not change much compared to the previous week and witnessed low volatility. The opening price and closing price were at the same level, meaning a doji candlestick in the weekly chart. It denotes a temporary indecisiveness on the direction of the trend during the past week. However, the bullish trend in the stock looks solid and as long as it trades above the key support at ₹1,300, the chances for price moving northwards is high. There is no weakness observed in the relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator seems to be steady. Hence, any correction in price can be used as an opportunity to initiate long positions. It is likely to move up to ₹1,365 and ₹1,400 levels, testing the life-time high of the stock. Stop-loss can be set below the immediate support at ₹1,300, because if the stock undergoes a correction, that level will perhaps arrest the decline. Below that level, subsequent support can be seen at ₹1,240.
 










 
Tata Steel poised to decline further (₹333.1)
Tata Steel witnessed selling pressure last week and the price broke below the lower boundary of the ₹345-380 range that had been holding the stock for the past three weeks. The break down opens the door for further weakness in the stock. It has pierced below the 21-day moving average as well. The daily relative strength index stays below the mid-point level of 50, where the moving average convergence divergence indicator is in the negative territory. All this could indicate that the stock might attract more selling pressure in upcoming trading sessions. Even though the stock currently hovers around a support at ₹330, traders with short-term and medium-term perspective can sell it on rallies. Below that level, the price will most probably depreciate to the psychological level of ₹300 in the short term. The support comes in at ₹280 levels. However, if the stock moves up from the current levels, rallies could be capped between ₹345 and ₹360. It posted a weekly loss of 7.3 per cent."

State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to cut the interest rate on savings bank (SB) deposits up to Rs 1 lakh to 3.25 per cent from 3.50 per cent in the back drop of ample liquidity in the banking system and the bank linked retail and micro, small and medium enterprise loans to the repo rate.
This move by India’s largest bank will prompt other public sector banks to also follow suit.
SBI’s SB deposits above Rs 1 lakh currently carry an interest rate of 3 per cent.
Along with the SB deposit rate cut, SBI has also cut its Retail Term Deposit and Bulk Term Deposit interest rates in the ‘1 year to less than 2 years’ tenor by 10 basis points and 30 basis points respectively to 6.30 per cent and 5.90 per cent, respectively, with effect from October 2019.10.9
In view of the festival season and extending benefit to customers across all segments, SBI has reduced its Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points across all tenors with effect from October 10. The one year MCLR will come down to 8.05 per cent from 8.15 per cent."

32,2019-10-15,State Bank,"NCLAT members give differing views in the Visa Infrastructure case
BL Research Bureau
While there are numerous issues cropping up under IBC---undue delay in resolution of large accounts being a key one-- there are other ambiguities and disputes that are turning out to be just as unsettling. In the Visa Infrastructure case, for instance, the State Bank of India’s application to initiate insolvency proceedings itself has been stuck for the past ten months. Recently, the appeal filed by SBI before the NCLAT, resulted in dissenting views by the two members of the bench, leading to the direction of constituting a third Judge, to decide on the matter.
 SBI had filed an appeal with the NCLAT against an NCLT order (in January), rejecting its application for initiation of insolvency proceedings against Visa Infrastructure (corporate debtor). Visa Infrastructure (the promoter of Visa Steel) had stood as the corporate guarantor to Visa Steel.
SBI, along with other, lenders had granted various credit facilities to Visa Steel (borrower company). In 2012, Visa Steel was referred to the Corporate Debt Restructuring Forum (CDR) and lenders had restructured the financial facilities and guarantee according to the CDR package.
The CDR package provided that the promoters would infuse additional equity funds of ₹325 crore and such infusion of equity may be brought in the form of unsecured loan/ preference shares or by issuing fresh shares or by merging/ demerging some business divisions into separate companies/SPVs thorough scheme/slump sale and inviting strategic investor under the debt restructuring package.
Further, Visa Infrastructure--also the promoter of Visa Steel-- executed a corporate guarantee in favour of the lenders and created a negative lien on its property situated at Visa House, Alipor Road, Kolkata, to secure the restructured debt. The negative lien on Visa House was to be provided as security until the promoter brought in additional equity of ₹125 crore over and above ₹325 crore.
Admittedly, while promoters of Visa Steel had infused ₹325 crore in the form of equity as ‘slump sale’, according to SBI, the condition of bringing the additional equity of ₹125 crore was not fulfilled.
 The dispute primarily relates to how infusion of equity has happened under the CDR package.
Visa Steel had merged its subsidiary Visa Bao with itself. According to Visa Infrastructure, this had taken care of the required infusion of ₹125 crore into Visa Steel, as upon the merger of assets and liabilities of Visa Bao, Visa Steel had accounted for the difference between the fair value of net assets of Visa Bao and face value of equity shares issued being ₹460 crore as capital reserve and reflected under the heading “other equities” thus meeting its obligation of bringing ₹125 crore.
While SBI stressed that the guarantee did not stand discharged as the additional equity to be infused had to be in the form of ‘cash infusion’, Justice Bansi Lal Bhat, member (,judicial) stated that the provision does not talk of infusion of ‘additional equity funds’ but only ‘additional equity’. He added that SBI had not been able to establish that additional equity of ₹125 crore was to be by way of cash infusion only. On the other hand, Visa Infrastructure was able to demonstrate that post-merger the capital reserves have increased by ₹460 crore, satisfying the condition of infusion of additional equity of ₹125 crore.
Hence since the corporate guarantor’s obligation stood discharged, there was no debt payable or question of default did not arise. Hence the NCLT’s decision to reject SBI’s insolvency application under Section 7 of the Code, was not erroneous.
However, Balvinder Singh, member (technical) disagreed with this decision. He noted that the stated mechanism (capital reserves increasing by ₹460 crore) had not been envisaged in any of the options listed in the guarantee/undertaking (of infusing fund). It seemed to be an attempt to creatively show through book entry that the obligation under the CDR had been met. He opined that Visa Infrastructure had not discharged the obligation as per the terms of the guarantee and that NCLT had committed an error in rejecting SBI’s insolvency application.
With the NCLAT members equally divided on the material issue of ‘debt’ and ‘default’, the direction has been issued to constitute an appropriate bench--third Judge---to decide on the case."

SBI withdrew the processing fee waiver offer effective today, implying borrowers will have to shell out a tidy amount.

SBI withdrew the processing fee waiver offer effective today, implying borrowers will have to shell out a tidy amount.

BL Research Bureau
SBI recently withdrew the waiver of processing fee on home loans, which was a part of its festive offer up until now. While SBI and other banks have been wooing borrowers with attractive lending rates-- by launching repo-linked home loans this festive season-- the sudden withdrawal of the wavier of processing fee could play spoilsport to your festivities.
According to reports and an internal circular, SBI had waived off processing fee on home loans sourced up to December 31, 2019, as part of its festive offer. But effective October 15, this relief has been withdrawn, implying that borrowers will have to shell out a tidy amount as the processing fee at the time of taking a home loan.
So how much of a hole does it burn in your pocket? We look at processing fee charged by various banks to find out.
 Home loan processing fee is a onetime fee that is levied by a bank for processing your loan. It is charged to cover the cost of completion of loan-related formalities, including expenses incurred for documentation and credit appraisal and verification. Many a time, banks waive off this fee to lure borrowers. Usually, banks go all the way to offer attractive deals during the festive season, which include cheaper lending rates, zero processing fee, cashback offers, higher than usual eligibility amount etc.
While processing fee may appear small ---when compared to the home loan amount -- it is nonetheless a tidy sum that cannot be ignored.
For instance, according to the SBI’s website, the bank charges 0.35 per cent of the loan amount as a processing fee. The fee can range from a minimum ₹2,000 to a maximum of ₹10,000 (excluding tax). Further, expenses for a valuation report, CERSAI registration are recovered separately from the borrower. This would mean that may have to shell out a notable amount for taking the home loan, aside from processing fee.
Other players such as HDFC charge 0.5 per cent of the loan amount (maximum of ₹10,000 plus taxes) as processing fee.
In some cases, the processing fee with banks and other financial institutions can go as high as 2 per cent or more---without any cap on the maximum fee. For instance, ICICI Bank charges 0.25 per cent of the loan amount plus applicable taxes. This means that you may have to pay a higher processing fee for a high-value home loan/purchase. Kotak Bank charges a maximum of 2 per cent of the loan amount as processing fee. This implies an outgo of ₹1.2 lakh for a ₹60 lakh home loan.
In most of the cases, the processing fee is non-refundable, even if the desired loan amount doesn’t get sanctioned. Therefore, it is better to make a comparison between financial institutions and their processing fee policies before you apply for loan. Though lending rates are paramount while making a decision, processing fee could also be a significant expense that one has to consider.
Even if lending institutions provide a limited period offer of zero processing fees, the advantage may be negated with other charges such as legal fee or documentation charges. 
There are other charges that lenders charge for home loans such as document related fees, legal fees, administration fees and other statutory levies. Further, financial institutions may charge some additional fees, even after you take a loan -- for rescheduling of the loan payment, change in EMI date etc.,
Thus, aside from lending rates and loan tenure, keep track of other charges too, while taking a loan."

26,2019-10-20,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide
After a subdued opening, the stock of SBI rallied in the end of last week and broke out of the range between ₹246 and ₹262. The price is testing the 21-day moving average which falls at around ₹270. The daily relative strength index indicates a bullish divergence and the moving average convergence divergence indicator, too, shows an uptick.
The short-term outlook of the stock is bullish, which could lead it higher to ₹275 level, a resistance that coincides with the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bear trend.
Above that level, the medium-term trend of the stock will turn bullish and attract more buyers, which could lift the price to ₹290 in the coming sessions.
Above that ₹300 — a psychological level — is the next hurdle. On the other hand, if stock cannot hold on to the bullish momentum and the price corrects, the supports will be at ₹262 and ₹267. The stock posted a weekly gain of nearly 6 per cent.










The stock price of ITC traded sluggish the past week trading in a tight range between ₹243 and ₹247. After a significant fall in the preceding week, the stock could not post a recovery and was resisted strongly at ₹247. Since the major trend is bearish, the stock will have difficulty breaking out of that level.
The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator is flat and do not indicate any bias. The price of ₹247 is also coincides with the 50-day moving average, and the 21-day moving average lies at ₹249, making the price area between ₹247 and ₹249 a significant resistance zone.
Since the stock has formed a good base at ₹243, it is not recommended to approach the stock with a negative bias. If the price breaches either ₹243 or ₹249. A breakout will result in the stock moving towards ₹253, whereas a break-down will result in the stock declining to the previous low of ₹234. The stock posted a weekly gain of 1 per cent.










After breaking out of the range between ₹780 and ₹800 on the upside, Infosys opened the week significantly lower. But further decline in the price was arrested by a support at ₹760, coincided by the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous uptrend. Importantly, the 21-day moving average has gone below the 50-day moving average, suggesting the possibility of the medium-term trend becoming bearish.
A significant weakness is observed in the moving average convergence divergence indicator. One can also observe a head- and-shoulders pattern in the daily chart, which is an indication of trend reversal. A close below ₹760 on a daily basis will confirm the pattern and result in the stock tumbling to ₹673, as projected by the pattern. Noticeably, the stock has a support at ₹725.
On the other hand, if the stock takes support at ₹760 and moves up, it will face a hurdles at ₹780 and at ₹800. The stock posted a weekly loss of 5.8 per cent.










The stock of Reliance Industries had a muted start as it traded flat during the first half. In the latter half, the stock resumed its stellar rally and marked a new life-time high of ₹1,427.9 on Friday. With a close at ₹1,416.3, it has breached the ₹1,400 mark and could potentially trigger the next leg of uptrend in the coming days.
The daily relative strength index has entered the over-bought territory, but the price action looks steady. The moving average convergence divergence indicator suggests considerable upward momentum. The medium-term trend of the stock is strongly bullish, and it can be bought on dips. On the upside, the stock has the potential to climb to ₹1,485, beyond which it will face a resistance at ₹1,500.
However, if the stock is subject to a correction on the back of profit-booking, ₹1,400 will offer a strong support. On further correction, a less likely scenario, the stock will find support at ₹1,365. The stock posted a weekly gain of 4.7 per cent.










The stock price of Tata steel rose last week after taking support at ₹340 levels. However, it stopped short of breaking the resistance at ₹360. But the price has closed above the 21- and 50-day moving averages, thereby raising the possibility of further ascent.
The daily relative strength index has crossed the midpoint level of 50 and one can also spot a bullish divergence, making the case stronger for the bulls. The moving average convergence divergence is also showing an uptick.
The current closing level is a resistance, and if the stock manages to break out and appreciate as a result of buying interest, it could advance to ₹380 in the coming days, beyond which it will face a hindrance in the form of a resistance band between ₹395 and ₹400. Alternatively, if the stock obeys the resistance at ₹360 and declines, it will decline to ₹345, below which the support is at ₹330. The stock posted a weekly return of about 6 per cent."

Pine Labs, a merchant-focused company, is betting big on Equated Monthly Installments (EMI) space, roping in State Bank of India (SBI) as its latest bank partner to enable the bank’s customers avail debit card based EMIs through its Point-of-Sales (PoS) terminals.
This strategic alliance will enable SBI to extend EMI facility to its existing debit card customers via Pine Labs' POS machines at 40,000+ merchants and stores in 1,500+ cities.
It may be recalled that Pine Labs had last month entered into a similar alliance with Federal Bank, a private sector bank.
The alliance was aimed at enabling 5.7 million Federal Bank debit card holders to avail EMI at the Pine Labs terminals, instantly. It had also, recently, partnered with Bank of Baroda to offer EMI to the bank’s debit card holders.
Commenting on the tie-up with SBI, Venkat Paruchuri, Chief Product Officer, Pine Labs said, “EMI as a category is growing exponentially for Pine Labs. Today, Pine Labs enables EMI offering for over 35 million eligible debit card holders and over 45 million credit card holders”.
The offering not only appeals to the shoppers from a convenience and affordability standpoint, but also helps merchants convert store walk-ins to sales and increase ticket size. “We will continue to strengthen the debit card EMI proposition by adding more issuers in the near future”, he said.
Over the years, Pine Labs has built a network of over 90 brands and 19 banks and financial services organizations that empower EMI transactions for customers. As on date, Pine Labs enables EMI facility via credit and debit cards for over 85,000 merchants across 1,20,000 stores in India.

23,2019-10-25,State Bank,"SBI Q2 net zooms to ₹3,012 cr on one-time gain
State Bank of India’s stock jumped 7.19 per cent on Friday to close at ₹281.60 apiece on the back of overall improvement in second quarter performance, with operating profit rising 31 per cent, net profit surging more than 200 per cent (albeit supported by one-time exceptional item), lower fresh slippages, and betterment in asset quality.
The standalone net profit of India’s largest bank jumped to ₹3,012 crore in second quarter ended September 30, 2019, against ₹945 crore in the year-ago period. The bottomline was buoyed by one-time exceptional item in the form of ₹3,484-crore inflow due to sale of partial investments in subsidiary SBI Life Insurance Company.
In a bid to make the balance-sheet more resilient to absorb shocks on the asset quality front, the bank has utilised the entire proceeds of the aforementioned partial divestment to make upfront provision of ₹2,600 crore towards exposure to a power company, whose restructuring failed, and ₹900 crore towards exposure to a mortgage lender, which is likely to turn non-performing in the third quarter, said Rajnish Kumar, Chairman.
Operating profit was up 31 per cent to ₹18,199 crore in the reporting quarter, against ₹13,905 crore in the year ago quarter. Net interest income was up 18 per cent to ₹24,600 crore in the reporting quarter, against ₹20,906 crore in the year-ago period.
Other income, comprising fee income, profit/loss on sale of investments, forex income, and miscellaneous income increased 9 per cent to ₹8,538 crore (₹7,815 crore in the year-ago quarter).
Fresh slippages at ₹8,805 crore during the reporting quarter were down 84 per cent vis-a-vis ₹16,212 crore in the preceding quarter. Kumar said the normal average quarterly slippages will be in the ₹8,000-8,500-crore range.
Loan-loss provisions were higher at ₹11,041 crore (₹10,815 crore). The SBI chief said the bank has projected a credit growth of 12-14 per cent in FY20. The bank’s domestic credit grew at 8.43 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y), mainly driven by retail-personal advances, which grew by 19 per cent y-o-y."
22,2019-10-25,State Bank,"SBI reports lower bad loans and slippages, but sustainability will be key 
 
At a time when concerns over the stability and risks in the banking system have intensified, SBI---the country’s largest bank---checking nearly all boxes on key performance metrics in the latest September quarter--- is sure to calm ruffled nerves. But whether the performance justifies the exuberance in the market---the stock rallied by a tidy 7 per cent post the results ---is another matter.
True, SBI has reported a sharp fall in slippages in the September quarter, decrease in SMA (special mention accounts) book and significant improvement in core net interest income. But given that trend in these metrics have been bumpy over the past year, how far the bank is able to sustain the performance in the coming quarters, will be critical. Importantly, even if fresh slippages continue to moderate, the stock of bad loan problem needs to be addressed quickly, if lenders such as SBI have to see significant improvement in earnings.
Despite the reduction in the September quarter, SBI’s bad loan book is still a large Rs 1.61 lakh crore. SBI has about ₹25,000 crore exposure to accounts under the RBI’s first and second list (referred to IBC). The bank has made ₹22,399 crore or 89.6 per cent provisioning against them. The bank’s exposure to all cases under NCLT (including cases beyond the two lists) is over ₹1.16 lakh crore. Unlocking of capital by way of write-backs will be critical to ramp up credit growth.
SBI has also not moved to the new corporate tax rate regime. Hence the deferred tax asset (DTA) adjustment is pending, which can impact earnings in the coming quarters.
Why the exuberance
For SBI, after it reported steep slippages of Rs 33,670 crore in the March 2018 quarter, quarterly additions to bad loans have been under focus. While slippages had moderated in FY19—from about Rs 10,000 crore quarterly slippages in the first half to Rs 4,000-7,000 crore in the second half----they had shot up again to Rs 16,212 crore in the previous June quarter.
In the September quarter, slippages have nearly halved to Rs 8,805 crore, which is comforting. As a result, bad loan book has declined to Rs 1.61 lakh crore from Rs 1.68 lakh crore in the June quarter.
The other key concern in the June quarter was the sharp rise SBI’s SMA1 (where payments are overdue by 31-60 days) and SMA2 (overdue by 61-90 days) book--- to Rs 10,289 crore in the June quarter from Rs 7,762 crore in the March quarter. The SMA1 and SMA 2 book has declined to Rs 9,312 crore in the latest September quarter, which is also a positive trend.
Aside from improvement in asset quality, SBI’s core performance has also picked up significantly in the September quarter, beating most expectations. After a subdued 5 per cent growth in core net interest income (NII), the bank delivered a strong 17.7 per cent growth in NII in the September quarter, cheering the market.
What needs a watch?
While sharp fall in slippages is a key positive, it needs to be seen if the trend continues. In the past 4-6 quarters, slippages have fallen and risen sharply, making it difficult to gauge the broad trend. For instance, after slippages fell sharply to about Rs 4,500 crore in the December 2018 quarter (from Rs 10,700 crore in the June 2018 quarter), they had again spiked to Rs 16,000 crore levels in the previous June quarter. Given the persisting unfavourable credit risk environment, spikes in slippages in the ensuing quarters cannot be ruled out.
Also, after the one-off recovery in the June quarter last year, recoveries have not been significant. Much of the reduction in bad loans has come from write-offs in the past few quarters. In the September quarter too write-offs stood at a substantial Rs 12,000 crore (reduction in bad loans less recovery). Write-offs mean that banks fully provide for bad loans (taking a knock on profits) and take them off the books.
While SBI’s SMA book has reduced in the September quarter, at a little over Rs 9,300 crore it is still a significant amount. Also, post RBI’s June circular (revised framework for resolution of stressed accounts), in 15 standard accounts of SBI, inter-creditor agreement (ICA) has been signed or likely to be signed. On a default, banks have to decide on the resolution plan, which requires all lenders to enter into an ICA. These accounts amount to Rs 16,822 crore and carry about 13 per cent provision. A substantial stressed assets pool leaves open the possibility of notable slippages.
SBI has Rs 35,735 crore exposure to the telecom sector as of September 2019. The Supreme Court’s recent verdict on adjusted gross revenue, is expected to hurt telecom operators and their debt repayment ability. How this impacts banks such as SBI needs to be seen.
On the core business front, while the notable rise in NII in the September quarter is a positive, how far the bank is able to maintain its net interest margin (NIM)---post the launch of repo-linked loans----needs to be seen. While increase in yields and fall in cost of deposits has aided NIM this time around, the notable pick up in NII has also been due to lower interest reversal in the September quarter. In the September quarter last year, the bank had seen slippages rise sharply owing to which NII growth was subdued.
As such SBI’s domestic loan growth of 8 per cent in the September quarter lags that of leading private banks. HDFC Bank’s domestic loans grew by 20 per cent in the latest September quarter. However, SBI’s retail loan growth was a healthy 19 per cent, led by home loans.
Finally, for SBI’s earnings to see a significant jump, provisions will have to moderate substantially. SBI’s provisioning for bad loans remained elevated at Rs 11,000 crore in the September quarter, owing to its large bad loan book. Unless there is sharp decline in bad loans, led by recoveries (rather than write-offs), earnings may not see a sustainable revival.

CMP: ₹280.5

The bank reported a loss on account of higher credit costs. Including the exceptional item, the profit has been ₹3,000 crore. The bank has not taken the benefit of the new tax rate (at this juncture), as it would like to consume the DTA. We have factored a higher rate and consume the DTA in the year.
Despite the higher credit costs, GNPA reduced by 10 bps on account of lower slippages (155 bps). The quarter did not witness lumpy slippages. However, this trend is highly evolving. DHFL is likely to slip next quarter, thereby increasing the run rate. We have only marginally reduced our slippages estimate.
We believe the resolution of the large steel account is on the verge of conclusion in its principle form. The Supreme Court has been hearing the case on a daily basis and is likely to have concluded the hearing in the case. We believe the ABV is likely to increase by 7 per cent with this recovery. We like the bank for its ability to gain market share, amidst consolidation among PSUs, key resolutions and ability to maintain its operating performance. We have not factored the recovery of Essar steel. It is likely to improve the book value by 7per cent."

The stock of SBI climbed throughout the past week, crossing an important level of ₹300; it even registered a 13-week high of ₹317.8 on Thursday. Noticeably, it has moved past ₹309, the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. After closing at ₹313.5, the stock is currently trading at a resistance in the band between ₹309 and ₹315. But the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator continue to indicate a bullish bias and the medium-term outlook of the stock is positive. So, with the current momentum, the stock will most likely break out of ₹315 and move up towards ₹335. Note that before ₹335, the stock could face a minor resistance at ₹324, the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. A daily close above ₹315 will confirm a higher peak, which could reinforce the existing bullish momentum. On the other hand, if the stock undergoes a correction on profit-booking, it has supports at ₹300 and ₹292. The stock has returned an impressive 15.3 per cent for October.
 










 
The stock of ITC gained during the past week after facing a sell-off in the week before. The stock currently faces strong resistance at ₹263 – also substantiated by the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend. Though the daily chart shows that attempts to break ₹263 for the past three trading sessions have failed, the 21-day moving average has crossed over the 50-day moving average, indicating a shift in the medium-term trend. Also, bullishness is exhibited by the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator. So, on the back of it, if the stock closes above ₹263 on daily basis, it will confirm a higher peak and will attract fresh buying interest, lifting the stock price further. On the upside, it will face resistances at ₹269 and ₹274. On the contrary, if the stock faces selling pressure, it will find immediate support at ₹258. But a break below that level could drag the stock to ₹250 over the medium term. Despite high volatility, the stock closed flat in October.
 










The Infosys stock was impacted by negative news and the price tumbled by a record level and even registered an 11-month low of ₹615.1. The 21-DMA has crossed below the 50-DMA; the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are pointing downwards making the medium-term outlook weak. However, the stock price recovered over the past week and managed to close at ₹687.9, above the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of ₹638. But only a break above ₹700 can lead to a sustainable recovery. Over the medium term, it is highly probable that the stock will consolidate within a broad range of between ₹620 and ₹700. In case the sentiment shifts in favour of the stock resulting in the breakout of ₹700, it will face hindrances at ₹745 and ₹760. Alternatively, if the price breaches the support at ₹620, it will test the 52-week low at ₹599.8. Below that level, the sell-off could accelerate, potentially pulling down the price to ₹575. The stock plunged 14.9 per cent in October.
 










Reliance Industries (RIL) continued its uptrend, hitting record high in the past week. The stock registered a new all-time high of ₹1,489.65 on Thursday and closed with significant gains for the third consecutive month. Though the bulls appear to be in control, there are some concerns which can be observed in the price action. The bearish divergence is visible in the weekly relative strength index (RSI), whereas the daily RSI is hovering in the over-bought territory after seven months. The moving average convergence divergence indicator also shows a bearish divergence in the weekly time-frame. These factors call for caution as the stock might witness a price correction. So, if the stock declines, ₹1,400 will act as a support. A break below that level could drag the stock to ₹1,360. But if the stock continues with the current bullish trend, it is highly likely that it will appreciate to ₹1,500. The stock gave a return of 10 per cent October.










 
A recovery in the stock price of Tata Steel accelerated last week as it cracked above a key resistance at ₹380 and closed at ₹399.8, testing the psychological level of ₹400. But the price has already confirmed a higher peak and the 21-day moving average is attempting to cross over the 50-day moving average – a bullish signal. The stock has also moved past the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous swing at ₹395, paving the way for further appreciation. The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are signalling a substantial bullish momentum. Importantly, the price action has developed a double bottom chart pattern on the daily chart, which already stands confirmed. The stock will face a resistance at ₹418, beyond which it has the potential to move towards ₹440. However, if the price level of ₹400 manages to hinder the gains, it could decline to the supports at ₹380 and ₹360. The stock gained 5.5 per cent in October."

After a strong rally in October, the stock of SBI seems to be consolidating in the band between ₹315 and ₹324 since the beginning of this month. The stock oscillated in this tight range during the past week and more importantly, it managed to stay above an important level at ₹315. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend coincides at ₹324.
As long as the stock holds above ₹315, the near-term bullish trend is not under threat and the outlook remains positive. However, a prolonged consolidation should be dealt with caution as it could trigger some profit-booking. The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence continue to suggest an uptrend.
If bulls regain traction in the coming days and the price breaks out of ₹324 level, the stock can appreciate to ₹335. The resistance above that level is at ₹350. On the other hand, if the stock weakens from the current level and breaches the support at ₹315, it will find an immediate support at ₹309 and subsequently at ₹300.










The stock of ITC had a subdued opening last week. But on Thursday, it closed at ₹265.85, above the strong resistance at ₹263 after multiple attempts. The close marked a higher high and confirmed a cup-and-handle pattern in the daily chart, a bullish signal. But the stock declined from that level and closed the week at ₹260.5, above an important support at ₹260.
Both the daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator hint that the bullish trend will continue. Also, the 21-day moving average continues to stay above the 50-day moving average, keeping the short-term outlook positive. Considering that the stock takes support from the current level and resumes its upward movement, it will face resistance at ₹269. Above that level, the resistance is at ₹274.
Do note that according to the cup-and-handle pattern, the stock has the potential to rise to ₹291 in the coming days. But if the stock undergoes a correction, there is a support ₹258. A break below that level could drag it to ₹252.










The stock of Infosys continued its recovery last week and glided past the resistance at ₹700, shifting the momentum in its favour. A weekly close at ₹708.1 would mean that it has broken above the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the prior downtrend, in addition to breaching the psychological level of ₹700.
Notably, the stock closed in the green for a second consecutive week, indicating that the recovery might continue to lift the price. Since making a low of ₹615.5 recently, the stock has returned a considerable 15 per cent. A close above ₹700 increases the chance for a sustainable recovery.
It is corroborated by a rising daily relative strength index. The moving average convergence divergence indicator, too, has entered the positive territory, showing some strength in bulls. Thus, the stock seems to have gotten past the negative sentiment and moved upwards with the first hurdle at ₹745.
Beyond that, the resistance is at ₹760. On the other hand, if rallies are sold into and the stock falls below ₹700, it could depreciate to ₹665, below which the support is at ₹620.










After witnessing a positive close for several weeks, the stock price of Reliance Industries moderated in the past week. The stock declined through the week but recouped some of its losses on Thursday. Thus, it seems to have formed a tight range between ₹1,432 and ₹1,470.
Even though the price witnessed a minor correction from its peak of ₹1,489.65, it continues to trade above the 21-DMA, the near-term bias is bullish. In fact, unless the stock falls below ₹1,400, the medium-term will be bullish. But certain hints indicating a possible loss in upward momentum cannot be neglected.
The daily RSI looks wobbly and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has entered the negative territory. So, on the back of these indications, if the price correction extends, the stock will have a support at ₹1,400. Below that level, there is a possibility that the medium-term trend will turn bearish, inviting more bears.
Such a scenario will drag it down to ₹1,360. Alternatively, the price will retest the all-time high, beyond which a resistance lies at ₹1,528.










The stock of Tata Steel began the week on a positive note and broke above the key level of ₹400. After trading above that level briefly, it started to weaken as it witnessed a hindrance at ₹418.
The same price level is where the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous down-swing lies. Though the stock closed below the crucial level of ₹400, the fall was arrested by a reasonable support at ₹395. The daily relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicator is biased on the upside. Also, the 21-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average, indicating a positive bias.
So, the bullish sentiment can be expected to stay, resulting in a bounce from the current levels, until ₹395 holds valid. On the upside, ₹418 is a considerable resistance and if the stock manages to pierce through that level, it will most likely appreciate to ₹440 over the medium term.
On the other hand, if the stock price depreciates further, it could decline to the support at ₹380. Next support is at ₹360."

17,2019-11-17,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide
After seeing a flat opening last week, the SBI stock broke out of the range between ₹315 and ₹324. It made an intra-week low of ₹299.7, but bounced up from that level as ₹300 is a strong support. However, the upward movement was capped by a resistance at ₹324 and the stock closed the week at ₹321.9, moving back into the range. The 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend is at ₹324, making the level a significant one. But the bounce-back looks strong and will most likely lift the price above ₹324 in the coming days. The 21-day moving average continues to remain above the 50-day moving average, maintaining the near-term outlook on the upside. The daily relative strength index, after a blip, is showing an uptick, but the moving average convergence divergence indicator has started to show weakness. If the stock continues to move up, breaking out of ₹324, it can possibly rise to ₹335 in the coming days. However, if the resistance holds and the stock declines, it can be expected to decline to ₹300.










The stock of ITC fell throughout last week and closed with a loss, consecutive in the last five trading sessions. Since the major trend is on the downside, the bears seem to have quickly gained traction on the reversal, negating the breakout of ₹263 in the previous week. At ₹250 level, the stock is hovering around the 50-day moving average. This level coincides with the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bull trend and can thus act as a good support. But the daily relative strength index has dipped below the mid-point level of 50 and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has slipped into the negative territory. Both conditions are considered as indicators of bearishness, and the stock will most likely fall in the coming days. On the downside, the stock might find support between ₹247 and ₹250. A break below that level can pull down the price to ₹242 levels. Alternatively, if the stock appreciates from the current level, it will face hurdles at ₹258 and ₹263. The stock declined by 3.8 per cent last week.










The recovery in Infosys stock looks to have taken a pause as it appears to have entered a consolidation phase. The price has been oscillating between ₹690 and ₹725 for the past two weeks. Until the stock continues to trade above ₹690, it is highly likely that it will resume the uptrend in coming days. However, a prolonged sideways movement can be risky, leading to a decline. The daily relative strength index, like the price action, seems to have become flat, whereas the moving average convergence divergence indicator is still in the positive region, indicating strength. In a scenario where the stock breaks out of the upper boundary of the range at ₹725, it will most likely appreciate to ₹760. This is a critical level as the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bear trend coincides with the 50-day moving average. Beyond that level, the stock has the potential to advance to ₹800 over the medium term. However, if it starts to move southwards and breaches the lower boundary of the range at ₹690, it could depreciate to ₹665, below which the support is at ₹620.










The stock of Reliance Industries gained in the latter part of last week after gradually declining during the week prior. This hints that the bullish trend might have resumed after the minor correction. On pullback, the price marked an intra-week low of ₹1,422.5, coinciding with the 21-day moving average. It then bounced from that level and ended the week at ₹1,470.8, retaining the bullish outlook. But looking at the oscillators, we can observe some weakness in the stock. The daily relative strength index is showing a down-tick following a bearish divergence; also, the moving average convergence divergence indicator has moved into the negative territory. Both indicators hint a potential trend-reversal. On the back of these factors, if the stock declines from the current level, it will find support at ₹1,430. A close below that level would result in a fresh low, taking the price to ₹1,400. However, if the stock gains bullish momentum and continues to advance, it will retest the lifetime high at ₹1,489.65. Resistance above that level is at ₹1,528.










The stock of Tata Steel was sluggish last week, and is hovering around the support at ₹395. Since it has extended the consolidation from the previous week, the recovery in the stock seems to be losing steam. The support at ₹380, coincided by the 21-day moving average, holds the key for the medium-term trend. So, as long as it trades above that level, the stock will have a bullish bias. But a break below that level could shift the trend to bearish. Since the overall trend is on the downside, this might result in a sharp depreciation. The daily relative strength index along with the moving average convergence divergence is showing a downward bias as it entered the negative territory. So, if the price weakens from the current level, the stock might slip towards the support at ₹380 in the near term, below which the support is at ₹360. On the other hand, if the stock starts moving on the upside, it will immediately face a resistance at ₹400. Above that level, the hurdle lies at ₹418 — the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend."

SBI Card, the country's second largest credit card issuer, and Vistara, a full-service carrier, have joined hands to launch a one-of-its-kind premium credit card for travel savvy urban Indians.
Launched in two variants, Club Vistara SBI Card PRIME and Club Vistara SBI Card, the new card has been designed to offer a rewarding travel experience to cardholders, through unique benefits and unmatched value proposition, on domestic and international travel spends.
Speaking at the launch, Hardayal Prasad, MD & CEO, SBI Card, said this marked a defining moment in the 21 year journey of the SBI Card. ""After GE's exit we are reinventing ourselves in the way we conduct business. This is one of the most important co branding tie-ups we have entered into and we were looking forward to it,"" he said.
Till date, the SBI Card had 16 co-branded tie-ups with retail institutions and ten with banks, according to Prasad.
He said that the SBI Card has always strived to bring products for its customers that are customised as per their diverse lifestyle and preferences, offering maximum value and enhanced experience. ""We want our customers to experience the benefits of both the brands coming together. Travel is one of the key spend categories for our cardholders. Through our partnership with Vistara, we aim to address unique requirements of our customers, especially urban millennials, whose spend on travel has increased over a period of time and are looking for related privileged benefits"", Prasad said.
Leslie Thng, Chief Executive Officer, Vistara, said, “Our endeavour is to enhance the value proposition of Club Vistara and elevate its position from a frequent flyer program to a more attractive, comprehensive lifestyle program that makes an essential part of everyday lives of our customers.""
He made it clear that Vistara had no immediate plan to spin off Club Vistara into a separate entity.
Thng also said that Vistara plans to bring more international airlines (already has Singapore Airlines) under its Club Vistara programme in the coming days. Vistara will also fly to more international destinations in 2020 once it gets wide-bodied aircraft in February or March next year, he added.
The Club Vistara SBI Card offers benefits such as, one-way Premium Economy tickets on joining and achieving spends-based milestone(s), complimentary Club Vistara Silver tier membership, up to six free cancellation of flight tickets booked on Vistara channels viz website, app and helpline, and also complimentary lounge access- up to four international and eight domestic, among host of other benefits.
""As travel spends continue to significantly rise among today’s urban consumers, we wish to provide more options to the ever-increasing number of our loyal customers to join Club Vistara and enjoy the privileges of their Club Vistara membership,"" Thng said.
Vistara has this year, especially in the last few months, embarked on an accelerated growth plan. It has expanded its footprint to 11 new destinations including four overseas ones in the last seven months.
The two variants of the Club Vistara SBI Card come with several benefits and privileges, such as complimentary Club Vistara Silver/Base tier membership, welcome tickets on Vistara’s domestic network, One-Class Upgrade voucher, free cancellation on Vistara bookings, travel insurance protection, lounge access vouchers, complimentary membership to Priority Pass Program, and attractive rewards on reaching milestone spends.
Club Vistara SBI Card PRIME holders earn nine Club Vistara (CV) Points for every Rs 100 spent on flight ticket bookings with Vistara.
Club Vistara SBI Card holders earn up to four CV Points for every Rs 200 on eligible spends on the card. These CV Points can be redeemed for domestic and international flights on Vistara and its partner airlines.
While the joining fees for Club Vistara SBI Card stood at Rs 1499 plus GST, it is Rs 2,999 plus GST in the case of Club Vistara SBI Card PRIME."

SBI Cards and Payment Services Pvt Ltd (SBICPS), the credit card unit of the State Bank of India, has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) that could mop up between ₹8,500 crore and ₹9,500 crore, making it one of largest listings in the country.
While the company’s offer document did not spell out the total proceeds from the IPO, sources said the enterprise value of the credit card unit is expected to be around ₹60,000 crore.
According to the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), the offer will comprise a fresh issue of equity shares aggregating ₹500 crore and an offer-for-sale by promoter SBI (3.72 crore equity shares) and by investor CA Rover Holdings (9.32 crore equity shares).
On November 11, SBI, in a stock exchange filing, said the Executive Committee of its Central Board of Directors accorded final approval for the divestment of up to 4 per cent of the bank’s stake in SBI Cards through an IPO, by way of an offer for sale.
Per SBICPS’ draft red herring prospectus, the reserved portion for SBI shareholders is up to 1.30 crore equity shares and that for SBICPS employees is 18.64 lakh equity shares.
SBI currently owns 74 per cent of SBICPS’ total outstanding equity share capital, and CA Rover Holdings, which is an entity ultimately controlled by the Carlyle group, owns the balance.
Per the objects of the offer, the net proceeds of the fresh issue — gross proceeds less the offer expenses apportioned to the company — are proposed to be utilised to augment its capital base to meet future capital requirements.
The DRHP said that upon the completion of the IPO, SBI and CA Rover Holdings will continue to hold a significant portion of SBICPS’ issued, subscribed and paid-up equity share capital.
The offer for sale proceeds will boost SBI’s bottomline.
SBICPS is the second-largest credit card issuer in India, with 17.6 per cent and 18 per cent market share respectively in terms of the number of credit cards outstanding as of March 31 and September 30, respectively.
It has 17.1 per cent and 17.9 per cent market share, respectively, in terms of total credit-card spends in FY19 and in the six months ended September 30, 2019, per the DRHP."
13,2019-12-01,State Bank,"Digital transactions in October: Top score for Fino Payments Bank


State Bank of India and Bank of Maharashtra are the only two public sector lenders that have shown ‘good’ performance in digital transactions in October, while Fino Payments Bank has topped the monthly rankings by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.
ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank are the private sector lenders that received a ‘good’ rating by MEITY on digital transactions in October, along with HSBC. In all, eight banks received a good performance rating for October. The Centre has set a target of 4,000 crore digital transactions in 2019-20, with separate targets for each bank. It tracks the performance of each lender on a monthly basis.
According to MEITY data, Fino Payments Bank, with an overall score of 78, has touched 99.41 per cent of the annual target for digital transactions.
Meanwhile, IDFC First Bank, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank have already surpassed the target allocated to them. SBI, with an overall score of 68 in October, has met nearly 96 per cent of the target, while Bank of Maharashtra, with a rating of 67, had reached 98.3 per cent of the target. 
IDBI Bank, with an overall rating of 64, and Paytm Payments Bank, with a score of 64, rounded off the top 10 banks in October for digital transactions with a rating of ‘average’ performance.
According to the government’s DigiDhan dashboard, more than 2,356 crore of digital transactions were undertaken between April 1 this year to November 31."
12,2019-12-03,State Bank,"Banks have not been able to check diversion of funds: SBI Chairman


Rajnish Kumar, SBI Chairman
   -  BusinessLine




Rajnish Kumar, SBI Chairman
   -  BusinessLine


Noting that banking is done based on trust and good faith, State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar said that one of the biggest learnings from the recent developments such as DHFL and PMC Bank is how lenders monitor the end use of funds and check diversion of funds.
“One of the most difficult aspects, whether it is for Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) or any other corporate is that banks themselves have not been able to check the diversion of funds. It has emerged as a big problem,” he said, adding that banks have to find a way to do it.
He noted that while banks do due diligence before sanctioning loans, they cannot keep policing every account. “If that is what a bank has to do, then it will take years to lend to one account,” he said.
In an interview with BusinessLine, Kumar said that while businesses often fail due to a change in the macro-economic environment, there has to be a clear distinction of failure of business due to diversion of funds. “The biggest problem in the clean-up exercise is not using the fund for what it was meant to be...it has brought a lot of misery to corporates, promoters and banks. I hope that everybody has learnt their lessons and if the funds are used for the purpose meant to be,” said Kumar.
Terming the default by DHFL as an exception as it is not the norm for a AAA account to slip to ‘D’ or ‘junk’ overnight, Kumar, however, said that the corporate governance philosophy of the company is important and the first level of check lies with the auditor.
“I think auditors are still the best people to detect because they do a very deep dive. Rating agencies don’t do that kind of deep dive. Auditors have the first level of comfort. Banks also ask for audited balance sheet, which is a true and fair statement of affairs,” he said.
SBI has also begun to revamp its internal credit risk management architecture, which consists of pre-sanction, sanction and post-sanction, and then stressed asset and NPA recovery.
Kumar said that work is going on to strengthen the post-sanction monitoring and the end use of funds.
Remaining optimistic about a pick-up in economic growth, Rajnish Kumar said that GDP growth in the second half of the fiscal may be better, but the government needs to undertake many more reforms, especially for infrastructure financing.
Noting that there have been regular government interventions to attract investments with steps like the reduction in the corporate tax rate and the relief for the telecom sector, Kumar told BusinessLine that a “real push” is required for infrastructure financing to bring in private investments.

“Whatever were the issues in the first phase of the public-private partnership model need to be addressed. In the PPP model, the private investor should have a hassle-free experience.
“Unfortunately, it was not the case and many investors got stuck, so we have to bring back the confidence,” Kumar said.
Asked about State governments withdrawing power contracts, he said the sanctity of contracts in the ease of doing business is turning into a big issue. “When an investment is made, it is made on certain assumptions and then if midway they are changed, then the investor’s capability to invest further gets impacted very adversely,” he said.
On economic growth, Kumar said that indicators like GST collections had showed an improvement in October.
“That was September quarter... We are in the busy season... generally the second half is better. But a lot of investment is required to push the growth rate to what we hope it will be,” he said."

Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI
   -  Paul Noronha




Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI
   -  Paul Noronha


For Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, State Bank of India, the two years heading the country’s largest lender has been “full of action”. While the banking and financial sector has faced volatile times, Kumar is cautiously optimistic about prospects. Terming the move to consolidate public sector banks positive, Kumar in an interview to BusinessLine said he is also happy about the Supreme Court judgement on Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which has left no “grey areas”. Edited Excerpts:
It’s been two years for you as Chairman SBI. What has been your experience as it has been one of the most volatile times?
It was a difficult time for the industry as a whole and SBI is no exception to it. But still in this time, the bank is much stronger today in terms of balance sheet, provision coverage, NPA percentage, improvement in operating profit, leadership in digital space and lot of improvements have been brought about under the guidance of our board in respect of risk management. It has been full of action and not a single day when one can relax. 
The bank went into the red in between. Were you worried at any point that it is not the way you intended it to go?
No CEO would like the company he leads to be in a loss. But whatever was the accumulation has got cleared. So today when you look at our PCR, if that was not done, we would not have reached this position. Some of the losses were partly on account of mark to market; it was not just loan loss provisions. There was a huge movement of yields and we decided that despite forbearance available from RBI, we did not exercise it. So whatever was the loss, it was booked. March 2018, June and September quarters were bad.
Do you think the worst is behind?
It is very difficult to make that statement. But I think where we were in March 2018, the industry as well as SBI, definitely things are not as bad as in March 2018. There are a couple of reasons—AQR happened and a lot of assets were classified as NPA. In March 2018, SBI classified Rs 1,000 crore as NPA provision. After that at least there is no accumulation now. Whatever is there is for current year. We will never be facing a situation where such kind of NPA was required to be declared. Banks have adequate capital with government’s recapitalisation efforts. SBI’s capital position has improved. For SBI, the balance sheet and pre provision operating profit both are much stronger and there is a consistent effort in that direction.
Are you seeing any revival in credit demand?
We are lending. In retail, there is fairly good progress. Corporate, sanctions are there. We have a fairly good pipeline of sanctions and I am hoping disbursements will also take place but project loans; there is always a time lag in disbursements. So what we sanction today takes at least six months. So what we always want is a robust pipeline, I am not so worried about disbursements. Working capital limit, whatever we sanction is at the disposal of the corporate, they can draw whenever they want. There are no issues around liquidity.
Which sectors are you upbeat on for lending, apart from retail?
In retail, the advantage is in terms of diversification. In corporate, the problem is that, if one large account goes under, it impacts the bank very badly. In our project finance pipeline, there are only three sectors, solar, roads and oil and gas from where projects are coming. In terms of bullishness, we have concerns in power sector on the health of the discoms. It is case to case, state to state and discom to discom. If the health of discoms was good, then I would have been bullish on renewable. But till the time, their financial sector is poor; we will never be bullish on the power sector. More than the sector, our bullishness would depend on the quality of the corporate or people behind the project.
What do you make of the consolidation in the banking sector?
If executed well, then it is good for the industry and good for the banks. It was always felt that there is no need for so many public sector banks, so I think it is a step in the right direction. The execution part is for the individual banks on how well they execute it. We don’t see it as a worry or threat, it will be better. Maybe some burden will be taken off the shoulders of SBI.
How do you see the IBC playing out?
I am now very happy after the Supreme Court judgement. It has left no grey area according to me. Nobody was happy with timelines in IBC, there were issues. Now there is no reason why timelines can’t be adhered to. There were a lot of disputes; they were mostly arising out of distribution as there were various claims—operational creditors, unsecured financial creditors. So all that debate is now settled. So the scope for litigation will be reduced.

What about the decision to bring NBFCs to IBC?
It is a very good move, we needed a framework otherwise there was an issue. In the absence of any proper legal framework, the resolution was impossible. ILFS is a different case under Section 242 and it is going on. DHFL we will see but it is after admission into NCLT; the process would be same as for any other NCLT account.
What is the recovery percentage for cases referred to NCLT?
In IBC, two things –if the case is referred at an early stage without delay, then recoveries can be better. It all depends under what stage of stress, it is referred. If the company has gone down, then recovery is very difficult. There are certain sectors like aviation where you go to NCLT at whatever stage; the recovery will be very poor. Even a telecom company goes into bankruptcy; the recovery will be very poor. NBFC is a different case, though it is classified under the services sector but when they lend, there are underlying assets. But for aviation and telecom, there is no fallback for lenders to recover from.
Are you worried about private sector banks as they are eating into the deposit share of PSBs?
Deposits are mostly a function of interest rates. Today at SBI, our rates are relatively low as we have enough liquidity. Second is the service quality, which is more around transaction accounts. In current account space, private sector banks have a better market share. They got the first mover advantage with state of the art cash management product. For savings bank accounts, I don’t think there is much of an issue. PSBs have a very good distribution reach so the impact there is not much. And fixed deposit is a function of interest. Our FDs are growing by 12 per cent year on year. If I increase the rate by 50 basis points, the growth may be 17 per cent to 18 per cent.
How has the experience been with the repo linked rates?
We have linked all our retail loans, housing loans with external benchmark. All new loans are on this. We have given option to existing housing loan customers to switch. It has its own risks as to what if the interest rate goes up. So far it has not impacted NIM; it is all about managing your liabilities.
We have reduced the savings bank rates and linked it to external benchmark. At some stage, we had to set the floor also; otherwise it will hurt our savings bank franchise. So 3 per cent is the floor and we have not gone below that. Savings bank is a utility or transaction account, I doubt customers see it as an account from which they have to earn. For that, there are fixed deposits and other avenues. Cost of operations for savings bank is very high; bank has to recover those costs also. My entire distribution and ATM network, internet and mobile banking are for transaction banking.
Have you stepped up provisions for sectors like power and telecom, which are still to come out of the woods?
No. The provision for NPAs is 100 per cent almost and after all these developments, we will take a review. In telecom, it seems that things are moving in the right direction. The decision to defer spectrum payments will provide some relief.
In the power sector some state governments are reviewing contracts. How do view these decisions?
The sanctity of contracts in the ease of doing business is turning into a big issue. When an investment is made, it is made on certain assumptions and then if mid way they are changed, then the investor’s capability to invest further gets impacted very adversely.
Has the NPA recognition cycle come to an end or are you expecting more surprises given the tumult in the NBFC sector?
One is normal and one is sometimes an exception happens. In my view DHFL was an exception because it was AAA account and suddenly it started deteriorating. That is not very usual. All your exposure or strategy depends on internal and external rating. One can always wish that there are no exceptions.
Do you see an increased role of ARCs?
For ARCs, it depends on the accounts. We don’t sell bigger accounts to ARC as their capability to buy those accounts is very limited. I think bigger accounts, the resolution will mostly be through IBC process and smaller accounts will be either one time settlement or ARC sale.
Would you like to see something more on telecom after spectrum deferment?
We have to see the outcome of the review petition on AGR. Deferment for two years was a good relief and telecom companies have revised the tariff.
Do you think issues in the NBFC sector are settled?
Liquidity in my view is not an issue. It is all around solvency. Things are much better now in the sector.
What can be done to prevent issues amongst banks that happened in Altico case?
It is the responsibility or borrower of the NBFC, they have to take care of the cash flow and meet their repayments on time. The blame cannot be shifted to banks. My earlier observation on the Altico issue was based on certain information.
What has been the biggest learning from cases like DHFL and PMC Bank?
One of the most difficult aspect whether it is for Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd or any other corporate is that banks themselves have not been able to check the diversion of funds. It has emerged as a big problem. Banks can not keep policing every account. If that is what a bank has to do, then it will take years to lend to one account. The biggest problem in the clean up exercise is not using the fund for what it was meant to be...it has brought a lot of misery to corporates, promoters and banks. I hope that everybody has learnt their lessons and if the funds are used for the purpose meant to be. I think auditors are still the best people to detect because they do a very deep dive. Banks also ask for audited balancesheet, which is a true and fair statement of affairs.
What is next on your digital space?
The aim behind adopting any technology is either enhancing the customer experience, cost cutting, revenue enhancement or risk management. YONO is all about front end but a lot more is going on back end also. We draw a notional P&L and we are in profit. A lot more is coming. We are developing YONO business in a big way for SME to corporates. There will be a lot of convenience for opening of account, transactions, forex. It will be the same experience, which we have given for retail customers. The future is more about mobile banking that internet banking.
Are you seeing lesser number of people required with digital advancements?
That is not happening but re-deployment is happening. Front end employees are moving to different roles. We have done manpower planning and we are not very overstaffed as of now.
Is security a big worry due to digital transactions?
Cyber and data are burning issues so one has to be very careful. The bank has invested a lot of money in making the system secure but this is an ongoing process.
What are your views on data localisation?
We will wait to see what happens with the new Bill. Protecting the data is big issue globally. The way to view it is that SBI has a lot of overseas operations and lot of processing is done in India. If I have to keep data locally in every location in all 35 countries, it will become very difficult to manage our overseas operation.
SBI did some surveys with employees. What was the outcome of those?
We keep doing a lot of things on the HR front. One limited survey we did in Bangalore was on the culture and merger aspects. Then we had an employee engagement survey. We also had a programme called Nayi Disha (New Direction), which was implemented in two phases. Phase I was where we told our employees on aligning their personal value system with that of the bank. Phase II was on how to deal with customers, including the difficult ones. We keep doing these organizational interventions.
What are your big plans for the next one year?
It is the same steady plan. SBI is a big bank and it does not work on a three or six month or one year plan. Directionally, whatever is there, will continue---effort to improve the balance sheet, pre provision operating profit, bring down credit cost, improve credit risk management, continue to invest in digital capabilities and how do you manage your human resource."
10,2019-12-04,State Bank,"SBI’s ‘Atoot’ scheme to provide relief to family of employees dying in harness
To strengthen its long-term relationship with employees and to imbibe in them a sense of belongingness, State Bank of India (SBI) has introduced a scheme, ‘Atoot’, to provide immediate relief to the family of an employee dying in harness.
This scheme includes financial support for the funeral expenses to the next of kin (NOK); support, including embalming cost, cost of coffin, transportation cost, in case death occurs at other places; and non-financial support, including arranging for the stay of family members; keeping the body in mortuary/ arrange for preservation of the body till NOK comes; and making necessary arrangements for the processing and transportation of the body.
In case of sudden demise of employees, the bereaved family needs immediate support, financial as well as for taking care of last rites/ funeral, which may also involve transportation of the mortal remains of the deceased employee, the bank said in a circular.
“In the bank, apart from the superannuation benefits (pension, PF, gratuity) we also have provisions for ex-gratia (there is provision for providing ₹1 lakh ex-gratia in advance), compassionate appointment (if eligible under the scheme), and cash compensation (in case of accidental death while on duty).
“However, these benefits take time to reach the needy family....The bank is committed to take care of our employees and their family members, while they serve it and also after it,” according to the circular.
The scheme will be applicable to all regular employees of the bank, irrespective of cadre, including employees on mobile duty, deputation, contractual employees. Suspended employees will also be covered. However, it will not include retired employees, retired officers engaged on contract basis, officers retired under section 19(3), and employees of outsourced agencies.
The financial support includes ₹20,000 (in cash) to the next of kin of the deceased employee. In case an employee’s death occurs at other places, the bank will provide support for the transportation of mortal remains at its own cost and other related costs pertaining to embalming, cost of coffin, transportation cost and travel expenses for an escort."
9,2019-12-08,State Bank,"NTPC signs pact for ₹5,000-crore term loan with SBI 
NTPC has signed a term loan agreement for ₹5,000 crore with State Bank of India. A company statement said that the loan facility has been extended at an interest rate linked to 3-month MCLR of the bank and has a door-to-door tenure of 15 years. The loan will be utilised to part finance the capital expenditure of NTPC.
In March this year, the company had raised $450 million (over ₹3,000 crore) through a 5-year bond offering in the international markets. This issuance was under the $6 billion (over ₹43,000 crore) Medium Term Note (MTN) programme. Later in July, NTPC raised ₹4,300 crore through bonds, which were to be used for capital expenditure and general corporate requirement.
In August, the group got shareholders’ nod to raise up to ₹15,000 crore through issuance of bonds and to raise its borrowing limit to ₹2 lakh crore.
There was some troubling news for NTPC in November when Moody’s Investor Service revised its rating outlook to ‘Negative’ from ‘Stable,’ while retaining the investment rating."
8,2019-12-09,State Bank,"SBI cuts 1-year MCLR by 10 bps to 7.9% 
While the Reserve Bank of India has maintained status quo on the policy repo rate front, State Bank of India has decided to cut its one-year benchmark Marginal Cost of funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points effective December 10
After the latest cut, SBI's one-year MCLR comes down to 7.90 per cent per annum from 8.00 per cent per annum.
With India's largest bank linking floating-rate home and MSME loans to an external benchmark (repo rate) with effect from October 1, 2019 and fresh loans being sanctioned with reference to the repo rate, the MCLR cut is likely to benefit only borrowers who have taken loans pre-October 1.
This is the eighth consecutive cut in MCLR by SBI this fiscal year. The RBI left the policy repo rate (the rate at which banks borrow short-term funds from the RBI to overcome liquidity mismatches) at 5.15 per cent in its fifth bi-monthly monetary policy review."
6,2019-12-11,State Bank,"PSU Bank index falls impacted by State Bank’s higher NPA 
PSU Bank index fell nearly 1 per cent today after the largest public sector bank SBI reported about Rs 12,000 crore divergence in their non-performing assets (NPA) for the fiscal 2018-19.
At 12.25 pm, State Bank of India stock was down 0.45 per cent at Rs 312.05 on the NSE.
The Nifty PSU Bank index declined 16.55 points or 0.68% to 2,402.25 on the NSE.
Allahabad Bank, J&K Bank, Central Bank of India, Union Bank, Syndicate Bank, PNB, Indian Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Bank of India and Bank of Baroda were down between 1 and 3.50 per cent.
SBI's gross NPA was Rs 11,932 crore more at Rs 1,84,682 against Rs 1,72,750 reported for 2018-19, SBI said in a regulatory filing.
As a result, the bank has to make additional provisioning of Rs 12,036 crore in the balance sheet and the notional loss would have been at Rs 6,968 crore.
SBI had posted a profit of Rs 862 crore for 2018-19 in May this year."
5,2019-12-11,State Bank,"Investors eye companies planning to list subsidiaries


Some of the companies that are unlocking investor value by listing their subsidiaries separately are in great demand, particularly after State Bank of India reserved a portion of the SBI Card and Payment Services initial public offer for retail investors. SBI also plans to list SBI Securities.
Though dates for the initial public offer have not been finalised, SBI Cards plans to raise Rs 500 crore through issue of fresh equity and another 130,526,798 equity shares will be on offer for sale by the promoters. SBI has reserved 13,052,680 shares for its existing shareholders. Each shareholder can invest up to Rs 2 lakh under the shareholders’ quota.
Following the development, SBI shares spurted to Rs 310 on Wednesday, from their 52-week low of Rs 244 on October 9.
Similarly, HDFC and HDFC Bank plan to list their holding in HDFC Securities and HDB Finance, while ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank will list their subsidiaries, ICICI Pru Mutual Fund and Kotak Securities, respectively.
Among corporates, Reliance Industries has announced plans to spin off its holding in telecom giant Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail into separate entities.
In a move that is perceived as preparation for RJio’s listing and reduction of debt, RIL has transferred some of the assets and liabilities of RJio into two investment infrastructure trusts (InvITs) and brought in Brookfield Asset Management as an investor. The Brookfield firm had agreed to subscribe to Rs 25,215 crore worth units in the Tower Infrastructure Trust.
Jio's Ebitda stood at Rs 15,102 crore last fiscal, against Rs 6,734 crore in FY'18, though the sharp jump in EBITDA is not enough for RIL to recover investments of Rs 3.5 lakh crore in the next 10 years.
Atish Matlawala, Senior Analyst, SSJ Finance & Securities, said there are a number of companies which will list their subsidiaries in the next few months.
All these companies will reserve some portion of their IPO for shareholders of the parent company, thus improving the shareholders’ chances of getting allotment, he said.
If the IPO size is between Rs 1,000-1,500 crore, he said, it made sense to become a shareholder of the parent company before it files a RHP (Red Herring Prospectus) for the IPO. Usually, the date of filing the RHP is considered the cut-off date to be eligible for subscribing to shareholders’ portion of the IPO, he said.
In case of large IPOs of over Rs 8,000 crore, usually, all retail applicants will get at least one lot. However, if somebody wants to invest the full quota of Rs 2 lakh for the retail investor, it is advisable to become a shareholder before the cut-off date, he said."
7,2019-12-11,State Bank,"SBI’s bad loans up by ₹11,932 crore in FY19
The Reserve Bank of India’s final Risk Assessment Report (RAR) of the SBI has said that the bank’s gross and net NPAs should be higher by ₹11,932 crore each at ₹1,84,682 crore and ₹77,827 crore, respectively, as at March-end 2019.
This will have the effect of pushing State Bank of India into reporting a net loss of ₹6,968 crore in FY2019. India’s largest bank had reported a net profit of ₹862 crore in the last fiscal year, when it declared its financial results on May 10, 2019.
The divergence in asset classification usually arises when there is a difference in the NPAs, as reported by a bank, and as assessed by the regulator. Similar is the case with the provisions made towards NPAs. Such divergence either lower the bank’s net profit, push them into a loss or widen the loss.
For example, after the RBI’s RAR, Bank of India’s net loss widened to ₹6,993 crore in FY2019 against the ₹5,547 crore initially reported. YES Bank’s net profit for FY2019 came down to ₹1,084 crore against the ₹1,720 crore reported, post the RAR.
SBI, in its comments said, that after subsequent slippage/upgradation during FY2020, the remaining impact on the gross NPAs during the third quarter of FY2020 (October-December) is ₹3,143 crore. With regard to net NPAs, the bank said that after subsequent provisions made/upgradation of NPAs during FY2020, the remaining impact on the net NPAs during the third quarter of FY2020 (October-December) is ₹687 crore.
The RAR assessed that SBI’s provisioning for NPAs as on March-end 2019 should be higher by ₹12,036 crore at ₹1,18,892 crore. According to the bank, after the subsequent provisions for NPAs during the current FY2020, the remaining impact on provisioning during Q3FY2020 (October-December) is ₹4,654 crore.
After conclusion of the RBI’s onsite engagement, the RAR is subject to independent quality assurance checks. After these checks, the report is communicated to the banks as a Preliminary Risk Assessment Report (PRAR). This report is discussed with banks’ top management for seeking its responses and comments.
After the exit meeting and incorporation of banks’ comments, the RAR is issued with proposed risk mitigation plan (RMP). After this, a high level supervisory discussion takes place between the RBI and the banks’ top management where the major areas of concerns observed in the RAR are discussed and the proposed RMP is finalised."

   -  BusinessLine


 SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Saturday said most banks will be in a good position with respect to stressed assets by March and there is no dearth of liquidity in the system for lending.
 He added that there are opportunities to lend in sectors such as infrastructure and consumer lending as there is not much of a decline in demand from consumers.
“By March 31st, most of the banks will be in a good position with respect to stressed assets,” Kumar said at the 92nd Annual Convention of industry chamber FICCI here.
 On transmission of monetary policy, he said the banks cannot lower rates beyond a threshold due to asset liability mismatch issues.
 Kumar stated that there is no shortage of capital in the system, but the corporates are not borrowing enough and not utilising their capacities well.
 On lending to the telecom sector for the next round of spectrum auctions, he said, “For us lending to the telecom sector for spectrum is completely unsecured. On paper it is secured as the auction is to be done by government but practically it is totally unsecured.” 
 “So in such circumstances, banks will have to evaluate carefully before lending to the sector as the probability of default is very high,” Kumar said."
3,2019-12-22,State Bank,"Weekly Trading Guide: Infosys breaks out of the range
The resumption of the bull trend looks evident as SBI closed the week above the resistance band between ₹332 and ₹335. The stock began the week on the back foot, slipping to the support level of ₹325. This support also coincides with the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bull trend. The stock took support at this level and began to rally. The bullish stance is corroborated by key oscillators. The relative strength index in the daily chart shows a fresh uptick following the rally in price. 
 










 
Also, the moving average convergence divergence indicator is on the verge of entering the positive territory. Thus, traders can continue to take a bullish view and initiate long positions on corrections. The initial stop-loss can be placed at ₹320 and subsequently revised upwards by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock moves upward. The immediate resistance is currently at ₹351 currently — its previous high. The subsequent resistance is at ₹362.
The prevailing bear trend, which has been in place since the beginning of November, appears to be limiting the upside in the stock. The stock of ITC gave up its entire intra-week gains. In the past week, after breaking out of the resistance at ₹243, the stock faced resistance at ₹247.5, and started to decline from that level. This level coincides with the 38.2 Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend, making it a significant resistance. 
 










 
However, fresh short positions are not recommended at the current levels even though the stock is trading with a bearish bias, as the risk-reward ratio is not favourable. Importantly, the moving average convergence divergence indicator in the daily chart shows signs of recovery as it has moved into the positive region. Moreover, the price level of ₹235 is a strong support. Hence, unless the stock breaks either ₹235 or ₹247.5, the trend will be unclear. Until then, traders can adopt a range- trading strategy. The resistance above ₹247.5 is at ₹252; the support below ₹235 is at ₹228.
After consolidating since the beginning of November, the stock of Infosys moved out of the range between ₹690 and ₹725. It rallied past the upper boundary of the range at ₹725 and closed the week at 731.5, confirming the breakout. Thus, the medium- term outlook for the stock has become bullish. Adding to the positive bias, the daily relative strength index has formed a new high, following the breakout. Also, the moving average convergence divergence in the daily chart is exhibiting bullish bias. 
 








 
 
The 21- and 50-DMAs are currently at the same level, ie, ₹710, and the stock is trading well above that level — another positive indication. From the perspective of trading, one can initiate fresh long positions on dips with a dynamic stop-loss. While the initial stop- loss can be placed at ₹700, move it upwards by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock advances. The primary target can be at the resistance level of ₹760 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. On further appreciation, the stock can rise to ₹800.
The stock of Reliance Industries (RIL), which has been in an uptrend since August, has been consolidating within a range for the past month. But recently, it bounced from the 21-day moving average and registered a fresh lifetime high of ₹1,617.55. Thus, the bull trend seems to be gaining traction after the pause. But it should be noted that, despite making new highs, the relative strength index (RSI) and the moving average convergence divergence indicator are showing a lack of momentum. In fact, we can spot a bearish divergence in the RSI, hinting at the possibility of a trend- reversal. 
 








 
 
However, the stock has a solid base at ₹1,534, and unless the price breaks below it, the trend-reversal cannot be confirmed. Also, the 21-day moving average is acting as a reasonable support. So, traders can be cautiously bullish and buy the stock on declines. Place a trailing stop-loss at ₹1,550 and raise it by 1.5 times the daily ATR (Average True Range) as the stock appreciates. The short-term targets are at ₹1,665 and ₹1,700.
Extending the bull run, the stock of Tata Steel surged last week. It breached a crucial resistance at ₹434. Thus, it has formed a new peak in the daily chart, denoting a good upward momentum. Substantiating the bullish bias, the moving average convergence divergence indicator in the daily chart continues to advance, implying considerable strength in the uptrend. 
 
 








 
 
However, while the bull trend is backed by several factors, it may not be favourable to buy the stock at the current levels as ₹460 is a crucial resistance. Also, the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level is at ₹470. So, the price band between ₹460 and ₹470 might act as a resistance band, where the stock can witness some profit- booking. From a trading perspective, it can be approached in two ways. Either initiate fresh long positions on a close above ₹470 with the stop-loss at ₹445 or buy the stock if the price moderates to ₹440 with the stop- loss at ₹425. The potential targets on the upside are at ₹495 and ₹515."

State Bank of India (SBI) has strengthened its security system on ATM withdrawals by introducing OTP (one-time password) based withdrawals of above Rs 10,000 with effect from January 1, 2020.
India’s largest bank, in a statement, said the service would be functional between 8 am and 8 pm at all SBI ATMs.
Along with the Debit Card PIN, customers will also have to put the OTP generated on their mobile numbers registered with the bank, while withdrawing over Rs 10,000.
However, this facility will not be applicable for cash withdrawals at non-SBI ATMs because this functionality has not been developed in the National Financial Switch (NFS).
With this facility, SBI has added another layer of safety and security in all its ATMs to minimise the number of unauthorised ATM transactions, the bank said.
This additional factor of authentication for ATM cash withdrawals will protect SBI debit card holders from the risk of skimming, card cloning, etc, it added.
The OTP is a system-generated numeric string of characters that authenticates the user for a single transaction."

 The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday announced a reduction in its external benchmark-based rate by 25 basis points to 7.80 per cent from 8.05 per cent.
The new rates will be applicable from January 1, 2020, the bank said in a statement. SBI “has announced the reduction in its external benchmark-based rate (EBR) by 25 basis points to 7.80 per cent p.a from 8.05 per cent per annum with effect from January 1, 2020,” it said.
With this reduction, the interest rate for existing home loan customers as well as micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) borrowers who have availed of loans linked to the external benchmark based rate would come down by 25 basis points, it said.

0,﻿2019-12-30,State Bank,"SBI cuts external benchmark rate on loans by 25 basis points 


State Bank of India (SBI), on Monday, said it will reduce the external benchmark-based rate (EBR) by 25 basis points (bps) from 8.05 per cent to 7.80 per cent from January 1. The EBR-cut comes in the backdrop of ample liquidity in the banking system. 
With this reduction, interest rate for existing home loan customers as well as MSME (micro, small and medium enterprise) borrowers who have availed loans linked to EBR, will come down by 25 bps.
For example, floating interest rate home loan for salaried customers for loans up to ₹30 lakh will be available at an interest rate starting from 7.90 per cent (previously at 8.15 per cent) for women borrowers and 7.95 per cent (8.20 per cent for general borrowers).
Last month, the bank had announced reduction in its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 bps across all tenors. 
The one-year MCLR has come down to 8 per cent from 8.05 per cent with effect from November 10. This cut was the seventh consecutive MCLR cut in FY20. The bank had also reduced interest rates on term deposits (TDs) with effect from November 10. Retail TD interest rate was reduced by 15 bps for 1 year to less than 2 years’ tenor from 6.40 per cent to 6.25 per cent. Bulk TD interest rate was reduced by 30 to 75 bps across tenors."
