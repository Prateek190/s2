80,2018-01-08,Tech Mahindra,"TechM files petitions against RCom, subsidiaries over dues
Reliance Communications today said IT services major Tech Mahindra has filed insolvency petitions against the company and its two subsidiaries for recovering dues.
The quality of service and amounts billed are disputed, RCom said in a regulatory filing terming the petitions as “misconceived, premature and motivated by extraneous considerations“.
“We wish to inform you that Tech Mahindra Ltd, a vendor for call centre services, has filed petitions, as an unsecured operational creditor under IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code against the company, Reliance Telecom and Reliance Big TV, subsidiaries of the company for certain bills submitted by them for services allegedly rendered,” the Anil Ambani company said.
Noting that the aggregate amount of Tech Mahindra’s claim against all the three companies worked out to Rs 8.20 crore, RCom said “the claim amount is not considered material by respective companies concerned“.
“We submit that the petitions are misconceived, premature and motivated by extraneous considerations,” it added.
Reliance Communications, which is reeling under a debt burden of about Rs 46,000 crore, recently called off merger talks with Aircel, citing “legal and regulatory” delays.
RCom and Aircel had signed binding agreements in September 2016 for the merger of mobile business.
RCom’s Rs 11,000 crore tower deal with Brookfield is also being reworked following termination of wireless merger talks with Aircel.
Aircel tenancy would have been a sweetener for Brookfield in the tower deal, but the recent collapse of merger talks (between RCom and Aircel) prompted a renegotiation on contours of the deal between the Anil Ambani company and the Canadian firm."

IT major Tech Mahindra on Tuesday said it has partnered with e-learning platform edX to facilitate re-skilling of its 1.17 lakh workforce in emerging areas such as Internet of Things, data analytics, artificial intelligence and cyber security.
Founded by Harvard University and MIT in 2012, edX counts India as its second-largest learner base with over 15 lakh people enrolled.
“Today’s disruptive business landscape demands for our talent to be future-ready, and it is our responsibility to ensure that the right tools and innovative pathways are made available to them,” said Tech Mahindra CEO and MD CP Gurnani.
He explained that the chosen 10 areas are technologies that clients are increasingly focussing on.
“We are working together with Tech Mahindra to offer learners the tools they need to gain knowledge in the said areas in order to fast-track their careers and secure in-demand jobs,” said Anant Agarwal, edX CEO and MIT Professor.
The employees will be offered these courses, which are priced $50-1,000, at discounted rates that will be reimbursed on successful completion of the course.
Besides, the IT firm will offer opportunities for pre-identified learners enrolled in edX’s MicroMasters programme.
For anyone who completes these programmes and meets the minimum criteria of education and work experience, Tech Mahindra will assure a job interview with the company, Agarwal said.
Over the past few years, edX has witnessed 96 per cent growth in its Indian learner base, with the country constituting 11 per cent of the platform’s overall learner base.
According to a recent EY report, commissioned by Ficci and Nasscom, the IT-BPM sector is expected to be impacted the most by digital and automation trends, with 70-75 per cent of the jobs in 2022 requiring new skill sets.
It said, of the 4.5 million jobs in 2022, 10-20 per cent will be new roles such as 3D designer, AI research scientist and language processing specialist."

techm1




techm1


Three quarters ago, it seemed like the worst was over for Tech Mahindra and its telecom vertical (that contributes over half of its revenue) was set to recover. But much to investors' disappointment, the company has failed to deliver as per expectations.
In the recent June quarter, Tech Mahindra’s dollar revenue grew 0.6 per cent sequentially. This is the lowest growth figure among all the top-tier IT companies that have declared their results so far.
The telecom (communication) vertical has lost momentum. From a sequential growth (in dollars) of 2.27 per cent in the September quarter last year, the segment’s growth dropped to 1.71 per cent in the December quarter. It further slipped to a negative of 0.79 per cent in the March quarter. In the latest June quarter, the vertical has recorded a sharper decline of 1.8 per cent.
The number of active clients with the company increased to 864 in the June quarter from 843 in the March quarter. However, most of the additions were in the $1 million-plus (less than $5 million deals) bucket. Revenue from top five clients declined to 25.9 per cent from 26.6 per cent in the previous quarter.
The total employee base shrunk by 1,713 employees to 1,17,693.
The company has however managed a 36 per cent sequential profit growth, thanks to forex gains and increase in other income. Operating profit margins increased by 70 basis points to 12.7 per cent. The increase though not very significant, has found favour with investors. The stock has gained 5 per cent in bourses today.


Outlook


In the post results commentary yesterday, the management had sounded optimistic of the prospects in the current year with all recent acquisitions expected to pay off.
It expects LCC (Lightbridge Communications Corporation), a global network services company, acquired in 2014, to break-even in the coming quarters as the restructuring is over.
On the margin front too, there may be an improvement, said the company, as it works on possible levers – employee utilisation, automation and improving profitability at LCC. In the September quarter, though, there may be some impact on margins because of wage hikes.
Only if the new acquisitions made by the company in the last one year, start to add to revenues materially, the company can bridge its gap with peers in the coming quarters."

Andhra Pradesh IT Minister and the son of Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, N Lokesh, inaugurated eight IT companies here on Thursday on the premises of Techmahindra.
The building - Tech Hub - has been taken on lease by the AP Government from Techmahindra to provide space to the companies.


The companies


The eight companies are Amzur, Digipub Apex, ID Analytics, Insurance Box, Inventrax, VGS - Provigil, Virtual Offshore, and Vismaya Premedia. Together, they will generate 900 jobs.
The minister said on the occasion that in the next two years one lakh jobs would be generated in the State in the IT sector, 70,000 of them in Visakhapanam alone.
“The State Government is making all-out efforts to increase the IT exports from the State, currently at ₹2,000 crore, ten-fold in the coming few years,” he said. He said the State Government had formulated suitable IT policies such as the new designated technology policy to incentivise both IT space developers and IT companies. “Kapulauppada here will be developed as a major IT city by 2019, with residential and other facilities for the IT personnel,” he said.
On the occasion, two MoUs were signed with WNS Global and Patra BPO for starting operations in the Tech Hub. WNS Global will add 1600 employees to its current workforce of 900 in the city and Patra BPO will generate 800 more jobs in addition to the existing 1600.
The minister also released an IT product - XaTTaX, a GST filing and reconciliation solution - developed by Sailotech, a local IT company.
JA Chowdary, the IT adviser to the AP Government, also spoke on the occasion."

Sujit Baksi, President, India Business, Tech Mahindra




Sujit Baksi, President, India Business, Tech Mahindra


Tech Mahindra’s police emergency response management system — UP Dial 100 — for the 220 million citizens of Uttar Pradesh, has saved 460 lives in the past three months and a total of 800 lives since November, the company said.
The project is jointly implemented by Tech Mahindra and Mahindra Defence Systems.
The company claims this is the world’s largest integrated emergency response management platform and is unique in that the citizen response call centre at Lucknow is manned by an all-women team of 400, who receive 100,000 calls every day, 98 per cent of which are responded to in five seconds.
The languages supported are eight local dialects, 18 national languages and 16 foreign languages.
“Usually, police are concentrated at district headquarters; therefore, people in remote villages face huge issues with safety, especially women,” Sujit Baksi, President, India Business, Tech Mahindra, told BusinessLine.
“The Emergency Response Management System went live in September last year and helps people across 2,40,948 sq km in 75 districts, 689 cities and towns, 1,07,452 villages, and 1,530 police stations. Of the one lakh calls received by our team daily, 15,000 are of dire distress and the rest are for loss of passport, vehicles and so on.”
He explained that when a person in distress dials 100, the exact location of the caller is identified immediately, and the police station within the jurisdiction of the location of the call is intimated and action taken within 15 minutes.
A GPS system identifies the nearest location of the Police Emergency Response vehicle and the police are able to reach the caller within 15 minutes.
The convenience of lodging an FIR on the spot is also provided. Citizens can also access police help through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp.
“Unlike most other call centres where call time is limited, we encourage our team to engage with the caller till the police arrives on the scene. All calls are recorded for accuracy and transparency; provisions for communicating with persons with special needs have been made and crime data analytics are generated for the police to take proactive action. We have saved 800 lives, majority are women,” Baksi said.
Two more all-women call centres are being set up in Allahabad and Noida. On why they chose to have an all-women team, Baksi said: “Women are far more empathetic to people in distress.”
Tech Mahindra on July 25 also set up a Tech Support Centre for the Central Government at Noida, manned by 400 chartered accountants and commerce graduates, to help with GST registration and filing tax returns online.
“At present, the India business contributes just 3 per cent to our turnover. The aim is to take it to 10 per cent in the next three years” said Baksi. Tech Mahindra notched up revenues of ₹29,141 crore in FY2017, a 10 per cent growth over the previous year."

IT major Tech Mahindra on Monday said it expects to outgrow Nasscom’s industry growth projection and may touch $5-billion mark in revenues during the current fiscal.
Noting that there is a skill gap among employees, CP Gurnani, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Tech Mahindra, also said the company is geared up to reskill about 50,000 employees for the present and future requirements.
“We will beat the Nasscom projections.
“We are already at arun rate of $4.5 billion and we are growing more than 6-8 per cent....You do the maths. For 2018, I think we should be (at $5 billion),” Gurnani told PTI.
The company’s revenues during the last fiscal were $4,351.1 million, up 7.8 per cent year-on-year.
In rupee terms, it was ₹29,141 crore, up 10 per cent YoY. The revenue from operations was up 6.1 per cent to ₹7,606.38 crore during the second quarter of the current year while the growth was 6 per cent at ₹7,336.1 crore in the first quarter.


Reskilling


To a query, he said there is a need to reskill employees in emerging fields such as augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence.
“There is a skill gap. For Tech Mahindra, my biggest priority is to reduce the skill gap and invest in training, reskilling and creating the jobs that the new digital world is throwing up.
“So to tell you honestly, I need to reskill at least 50,000 people over the next one year because the market is ready. We need to create the skills.”
Reskilling is an ongoing process, but the “urgency is very high,” he said.
Declining to reveal his company’s hiring plans, Gurnani said the net addition was 10,000 last year.
The company currently has a headcount of 1.20 lakh.
Tech Mahindra opened up new markets in Latin America and Europe, Gurnani said, adding that though there is not much business from the West Asian market, the situation there is “uncertain”."

IT major Tech Mahindra plans to hire around 2,200 people in the US this year, same as last year, amid the American government’s call for creation of jobs in the country.
The Mumbai-based company, which has over 6,000 people working for over 400 clients in the US, has been recruiting resources out of colleges in the US over the past four years.
“Last year, we hired around 2,200 people and we expect to do the same this year as well,” Tech Mahindra President, Strategic Verticals, Lakshmanan Chidambaram told reporters here.
On the reasons for stepped up US hiring, he said: “That has happened because the message from the US government is very clear that they would like us to play a bigger role here (in terms of employment).”
Besides, some of the digital technologies being worked on require enhanced local presence, he added.
Currently, the US is the single biggest market for Tech Mahindra. The company operates out of 28 cities in the US.
It also has 16 development centres in the US, spread across rural and urban centres. The company has over 1.17 lakh employees globally.
Indian IT firms are facing challenges in the business environment and stricter work permit regime in countries like the US, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand.
Back home, reports of mass layoffs by various companies, including Tech Mahindra, have the employees worried even though the industry has consistently denied any such move.
The companies have maintained that the layoffs are part of normal business decisions, although many believe that these are directed more towards controlling costs.
Tech Mahindra was also in news lately after an audio clip went viral, which purportedly involved a conversation of an human resource (HR) executive of the company asking an employee to put in his papers by the following morning as part of a corporate decision.
Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra later tendered a public apology over the manner in which the employee was asked to quit.
Asked whether increased hiring in the US should be seen in light of the company laying off staff in India, Chidambaram said: “For sure no. There is no connect”."
85,2018-01-11,Tech Mahindra,"TechM profit up 6.6% in Q1 but concerns remain
Software firm Tech Mahindra on Monday reported 6.6 per cent jump in consolidated profit after tax in the quarter ended June 30 at ₹799 crore from ₹749 crore last year.
The profit, however, was driven not by improvement in core business but primarily by forex gains and sale of a property.
Revenues were up 6 per cent year-on-year to ₹7,336 crore in the quarter, primarily driven by a $17-million gain from the acquisition of HCI in the US, which closed in the first week of May.


A ‘mixed bag’


Headwinds continue to remain in the company’s major markets the US and the UK.
“Economy is a mixed bag. With a new President in the White House, there is a state of influx. There are so many problems in the US that we may escape wrath, at least for a while. I’m optimistic about Europe; the US is still a question mark. Other than that, macro economic conditions look good,” said Vineet Nayyar, Vice-Chairman, Tech Mahindra.
Nayyar said that currency headwinds, H-1B visa costs and seasonal weakness in the company’s Comviva business unit impacted margins.
“I am definitely not happy, but it is a good beginning as our enterprise business has grown,” CP Gurnani, MD and CEO at Tech Mahindra, told BusinessLine on the sidelines of the earnings announcement.
“It’s a good start. Clearly, from the previous quarter, despite of all the expenditures on H-1B and forex headwinds, we were able to improve our EBITDA margin by 70 basis points. We also made an effort on right sizing, which saw our headcount decreasing by 1,500 people, despite adding 2,000 BPO employees and 700 HCI employees,” he added
Tech Mahindra headcount has reduced to 1,09,328 employees as the company tries to reduce its operational costs and focus towards profitable growth.
“This year, we deferred wage hikes and gave hikes only from July 1, for people with 0-6 years of experience. The rest of the employees will get wage hikes on select basis, which will include 3,000-4,000 people. This hike will be effective January 1, 2018,” Gurnani said.
This means, as much as 70 per cent of the company headcount will not get any wage hike this year since only 30 per cent of TechM employees fall under the 0-6 years experience bracket.


Job cuts


Talking about the job cuts, Gurnani said most of the job cuts were being made in the firm’s telecom unit, where it is trying to get out of the ‘blue-collar’ engineering jobs.
The current utilisation rate of the company stands at 77 per cent, which it said might go up after recent job cuts.
Tech Mahindra added 21 active clients in the quarter, taking the active client count to 864 from the previous sequential quarter. Cash and cash equivalents stood at ₹6,016 crore as of June 30."

Tech Mahindra (TechM) bore the brunt of what we see as a strategic misstep (LCC acquisition) over FY16-17. We also believe the management has lagged in articulating and communicating a roadmap for LCC and its implications for the overall performance. This has tested both the street’s expectations and the investors’ patience (22 per cent cut in both FY18 EPS estimates and PER over the last 12 months).
Further, our recent discussions with the management suggest a possibility of incremental pruning at LCC and while we are convinced of the levers TechM has to improve margins, their play-out could get extended. This results in a 23 per cent/26 per cent cut in our FY18/FY19 EPS estimates. That said, the organic business is healthy (FY17 organic USD revenue growth was the highest among Top 5) and we remain convinced on the potential market opportunity for network services. Also, the 4QFY17 results setback appears priced in; TechM trades at 12x FY18F EPS, 13-31 per cent discount to peers. Thus, an optical improvement — once LCC stabilises — could revive investors’ interest, in our view."

87,2018-01-27,Tech Mahindra,"HC serves notice on TechM over retrenchment
The High Court of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on Monday issued notices to Tech Mahindra and the Telangana government on a writ petition filed by a few employees retrenched recently.
Admitting the petition filed by one Sudhakar Suddala and three others, the court asked the Principal Secretary (Labour and Employment Department) of the Telangana government, Joint Commissioner of Labour Ranga Reddy and the IT firm to respond to the notices in three weeks.
The petitioners have alleged that Tech Mahindra was resorting to large-scale illegal retrenchment of employees at its Hyderabad facility. They related how the Human Resources Department of the company was pressurising its employees to put in their papers and leave the company.
While expressing happiness over the High Court taking cognizance of the IT retrenchments, the Forum of IT Professionals, an association of the IT employees, felt that there were laws that can protect livelihoods of professionals.
In a statement, Y Kiran Chandra of the association, said that over 80 petitions had been filed with the Telangana Labour Commissioner’s office and with the Development Commissioner (the Special Economic Zone) in the last one month by employees of various companies, challenging the terminations.
“According to the Telangana Shops and Establishments Act, 1988, no employee can be terminated if there is a pending petition with the Labour Commissioner,” he said.
In the writ petition filed in the High Court, the petitioners alleged that even as the Joint Commissioner of Labour had initiated conciliation proceedings to resolve the issue, the company had served termination letters. They contended that this was in violation of the Act. Since the exemption from this provision of the Act to IT firms given by the State government was stayed by the court in another petition, the counsel for petitioners sought a direction to the Labour officials to act in reinstatement of the petitioners.
The IT company faced an embarrassing situation last week when a Human Resource executive of the firm literally forced an employee to put in papers. “If you don’t resign on your own, your services will be terminated tomorrow,” she warned.

 Software exporter Tech Mahindra today reported a 10.17 per cent increase in December quarter net at ₹ 943 crore, helped by a margin expansion.
The Mahindra group company’s revenues grew 2.9 per cent to ₹ 7,776 crore for the reporting quarter year-on-year and 2.2 per cent over the preceding quarter.
 Profit growth was largely helped by a widening of the margin to 16.3 per cent from 15.7 per cent in the year-ago period and 14.5 per cent in the preceding quarter.
 Earnings per share stood at ₹10.73 for the quarter, the company said.
 Chief financial officer Milind Kulkarni attributed the higher margins to a jump in utilisation which rose to 83 per cent and a change in business mix that saw the company moving away from low-yielding work, which helped the company offset the headwinds due to the seasonal furloughs especially at telecom clients.
 Its total headcount came down by almost 2,000 on a 17 per cent attrition rate to 1.15 lakh.
 Chief executive CP Gurnani said the linearity between revenue growth and job creation is lost because of automation and also declined to give a guidance on the employees front in the future.
 As more and more new deals are on the digital front--it accounted for 16 of the 18 new deal wins--the proportion of revenue from emerging technologies front grew to 24 per cent for the company.
 The company added 18 active clients compared to the trailing September quarter, taking the active client count to 903, he said.
 Gurnani said the company has a “reasonably good” order book at present and sees tech spends going up even though the core IT services may be “stagnant“.
 It will continue to invest in emerging areas like artificial intelligence and blockchain, among others, he said.
 From a geographical perspective, the US and Europe reported a growth of 6.3 and 1.8 per cent, respectively, while the rest of the world declined by 3.2 per cent.
 Gurnani said the banking, financial services and insurance vertical de-grew after nine quarters, while the enterprise segment clipped at 4.3 per cent on a quarter-on- quarter basis.
 The company scrip closed 1.14 per cent up to close at ₹ 605.40 on the BSE, as against a 0.65 per cent gain on the benchmark."

CP Gurnani, MD and CEO, Tech Mahindra


IT services firm Tech Mahindra’s consolidated net profit more than doubled to ₹1,222 crore in the quarter ended March 31, as the company improved on operational efficiencies supported by currency gains. 
The company had posted a net profit of ₹587.9 crore in the same period a year ago.
Tech Mahindra’s consolidated revenue from operations of Tech Mahindra increased by 7.4 per cent to ₹8,054.5 crore in the reported quarter from ₹7,495 crore in the same period of 2016-17.
The Pune-headquartered company’s headcount went from 115,241 in the third quarter to 112,807 in the March quarter. 
“Continued focus on operational metrics has led to improved performance through the year. Growth in digital areas is particularly encouraging,” said Managing Director and CEO CP Gurnani.
“Our digital business is more high value. For that I need different set of manpower. As my digital business has grown, my headcount has come down because the linearity ended from the ‘run’ business, which is typically a linear business, while ‘change and grow’ is about high end. We have been aggressive on automation, AI inside and outside and that has shown results,” Gurnani said, adding that the company is aggressively adopting bots to improve efficiencies. 
This also helped Tech Mahindra improve its utilisation levels, which stood at 88 per cent in the quarter under review, an improvement of about 3 per cent. Margins have also significantly improved from 12 per cent last year to 17.5 per cent in the March quarter this year. Top-5 client revenue was up 2.9 per cent quarter-on-quarter after four quarters of decline, while top 10-20 client revenue was up 13.4 per cent QoQ.
Gurnani said the company shed about $100 million worth of telecom business from its under-performing LCC unit, which helped improve margins. 
“It’s been a great year of execution despite volatility in the market place. Our customer accolades and various recognitions for sustainability reflect well on our long term strategy for growth,” said Vice-Chairman Vineet Nayyar.
For 2017-18, the company posted about 35 per cent rise in net profit at about ₹3,800 crore, while revenue increased by 5.6 per cent to about ₹30,773 crore from the previous fiscal.
Tech Mahindra also announced that its Chief Financial Officer Milind Kulkarni will retire on May 31 on reaching the superannuation age. Kulkarni will be succeeded by Manoj Bhat from June 1.
The board has recommended a final dividend of ₹14 per share on par value of ₹5 for the financial year ended March 31, 2018, subject to approval by the members of the company at its Annual General Meeting."

The stock of Tech Mahindra has risen nearly 16 per cent in the last month and a half.
The company recorded a 2.9 per cent increase in revenues sequentially and 27.9 per cent rise in net profits in dollar terms during the March quarter. The results were ahead of market expectations.
 








 
Tech Mahindra added four customers in the $20-million category and two clients in the $10-bucket during the March period. The dependence on the telecom vertical continues to come down; other key segments such as manufacturing and BFSI have grown at a healthy clip. The proportion of onsite revenues, at 67 per cent, continues to rise, suggesting improving client traction, though costs may rise with increased onsite hiring.

The communications segment contributed 41.6 per cent to total revenue in the quarter, compared with 46.3 per cent a year ago. According to Nomura analysts, telecom sluggishness has kept them “cautious on growth”.
CLSA analysts said further margin expansion depended either on a growth recovery in telecom or a rise in offshore leverage and that looked unlikely. It has raised the price target to Rs 600 from Rs 540, and ‘sell’ rating.
The company’s sharp cuts to headcount have “shrunk its bench and reduced its ability to react to improving demand conditions, and we expect it to lag the growth recovery in FY19-20,” CLSA analysts said.

Most of those who exited the company were rated ‘L’, which is the lowest of the three categories
   -  BusinessLine


  The country’s fifth-largest IT services company Tech Mahindra is learnt to have let go of about 1,500 employees for reasons ranging from poor performance to technology shifts. 
Multiple employees BusinessLine spoke to said that most of the exits have happened in the P1 Band, which is in the project manager and above levels. Most of those who exited the company were rated ‘L’, which is the lowest of the three categories. These employees were given two months severance pay with about 70 per cent of it being at the time of the resignation and the rest during the final settlement. 
A spokesperson for Tech Mahindra said the company has added 1,700 associates in the ongoing quarter. “Our endeavour is to build a digital workforce of the future. We will continue to focus on re-skilling and right skilling our employees to keep pace with the changing technologies and dynamic market needs. As a policy-driven company, We adhere to global standards and processes pertaining to our human resource,” the spokesperson said.
Zero tolerance policy
She said the company is deeply concerned with attempts at speculation and misrepresentation of facts in the media relating to their employees. “Tech Mahindra has zero tolerance policy on such matters, we are cognizant of our responsibilities and pledge to continue to create awareness among the masses regarding such falsehoods.”
But an affected employee told BusinessLine on the condition of anonymity as he feared that it will impact his final settlement: “On June 4, I was called for a discussion as a part of the appraisal process and they told me that my performance was not good. On June 7, I was informed that two months salary will be paid and I had to resign.” 
Interestingly, this employee claimed that he was rated “extraordinary” for two consecutive years in 2016 and 2017 and worked with clients such as BT and Orange. 
Tech Mahindra has 1.15 lakh employees and as an industry practice, around 3 per cent of the workforce is graded as poor performers. 
Another employee who works as a ‘Solution Architect’, said that he was shown the door after working in the company for a year.
 “I joined the company in 2017 from another top five software exporter with a lot of hope,” he said. 
When asked why they had asked him to leave, he said: “I was informed that my solution was not appreciated. This was not communicated to me at any point by either my manager or HR head,” he said, adding that he was just getting ready to get married when he was asked to leave. This employee was working on the AT&T account and also works in the P-band, which has employees with 7-8 years experience. He has, however, not resigned from the company so far. Another employee, who has been with the company since last 11 years, said he was consistently rated high and he had not been given any reason for the current poor rating. 
All these developments are coming at a time when Tech Mahindra, which in 2017 fiscal had revenues of $4.3 billion is undergoing transition, in an effort to keep pace with its peers in the industry. 
Last year, an HR official asked one of the employees of Tech Mahindra to submit the resignation by giving one-day notice. This audio conversation was leaked and went viral on social media. As result of this, Mahindra Group Executive Chairman, Anand Mahindra apologised on twitter. “I want to add my personal apology. Our core value is to preserve the dignity of the individual & we’ll ensure this does not happen in future,” he tweeted. 
‘Did Labour Dept know?’ 
The New Democratic Labour Front, which has taken up the cause of the affected employees of the company, told this paper that it wanted to know whether Anand Mahindra was aware of the developments at Tech Mahindra. “Don’t they know Industrial Disputes Act is applicable to IT employees and IT companies have to follow due process for any employment-related issues? Is this planned lay-off intimated to the Labour Department and permission obtained according to the law?,” a spokesperson for the Front said. 
The affected employees also pointed out that they were not put into a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), which is a standard employee improvement performance plan, followed by the industry. But the company spokesperson said that a grievance cell has been set up for employees to seek counselling whenever they need. 
As some sections of employees grapple with their future, Tech Mahindra has been struggling to grow its revenues. 
In the 2018 fiscal, revenues grew by 5.6 per cent in 2018 fiscal, lower than Nasscom estimates of 7-8 per cent."

IT services provider Tech Mahindra reported a 12.4 per cent increase in profit after tax as the company’s cost-cutting measures start to bear fruit. 
Net profit of ₹897.8 crore in the quarter ended June, a 12.4 per cent increase from the same period last year.
Revenue rose 12.8 per cent to ₹8,276 crore from ₹7,336 crore last year. Revenue in dollar terms was up 7.5 per cent from the same quarter last year to $1,224 million.
However, compared with the sequential quarter, revenue was marginally up at 2.8 per cent while profit after tax dropped 26.5 per cent. This was primarily attributed to the seasonal weakness in the company’s telecom business, led by a sharp decline at Comviva. Overall, the telecom revenues, which make up over 39 per cent of Tech Mahindra revenues, declined 6.5 per cent. CP Gurnani, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Tech Mahindra, said. “The overall business growth trajectory for the FY19 is on track. While business seasonality has affected the current quarter, our Run Change Grow Strategy with strong focus on digital transformation is keeping the business buoyant. The changing demand landscape for next generation technologies is going to fuel the digital business further.”
Gurnani further said that he expects the telecom revenues to get back to growth with the help of new deal wins and momentum picking up for 5G services across the globe. 
Tech Mahindra said the results were also impacted by the wage hikes and investments made in future technologies. Overall, the company hired 745 new employees in the quarter, with 13 new active clients added.
The company also announced that Vice-Chairman Vineet Nayyar has decided to retire.
“I would like to thank Vineet Nayyar for his leadership, guidance and immense contribution towards Tech Mahindra’s journey as a global digital transformation leader for over a decade,” Gurnani said. “Although Vineet has decided to retire, he will continue to be our guiding force.”
He added, “I would also like to welcome on board our new Chief People Officer Harshvendra Soin.”"

Tech Mahindra delivered a modest set of numbers in the June quarter — a seasonally strong period for IT players — though the company’s financials were mostly in line with market expectations.
In the first quarter, Tech Mahindra’s revenues fell 1.6 per cent sequentially in dollar terms (up 0.3 per cent in constant currency). TCS (1.6 per cent), Infosys (0.9 per cent) and HCL Technologies (0.8 per cent) had reported higher revenue growth during the first quarter, while Wipro’s declined by 1.7 per cent.
EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin declined to 12.9 per cent (from 13.7 per cent in March) for Tech Mahindra.
The company’s largest vertical, communications (39.6 per cent of revenues), saw revenues decline. But manufacturing and BFSI segments expanded during the June quarter. While three customers were added in the $20 million bucket, there was no addition in the $10 million category.
Barring TCS, all other top-tier IT companies witnessed growth that was narrowly led and not broad-based across segments in the June quarter.
Attrition has been rising steadily for Tech Mahindra over the last three quarters and was at 19 per cent during the period.
Discount justified
Trade body Nasscom’s has projected a growth rate of 7-9 per cent in FY19 for the IT industry. With a modest performance in the June quarter, Tech Mahindra will have to up the revenue momentum in the second half to reach even the mid-point of the industry’s range.

“The investment committee of the board of directors of the company has approved the proposal to acquire 100 per cent shareholding on a fully diluted basis in Inter-Informatics,” the software services provider said in a BSE filing.
Access to East Europe
Inter-Informatics has a presence in the Czech Republic and Romania and had posted a revenue of $10.7 million in 2017. 
The acquisition could also provide Tech Mahindra access to the East European markets. Tech Mahindra will acquire Inter-Informatics through its subsidiary Mahindra Engineering Services Ltd (Europe).

 Gaurav Probir Pramanik, who has faced bullying since childhood because of his sexual orientation, took to Twitter on Tuesday to talk about how he was mocked even at the workplace, while working for Tech Mahindra in 2015.
In a Twitter post, Pramanik alleged that Richa Gautam, the then global head of training at Tech Mahindra’s Business Services Group, constantly mocked the colour of his clothes and his “effeminate” behaviour. He said this was a key reason for his quitting the company three years ago. Pramanik claimed he had been mum since then as he was awaiting the Supreme Court verdict on Section 377. 
Pramanik posted screenshots of a letter he wrote to Richa, who headed the company’s Anti Sexual Harassment Committee, and was then Chief Diversity and Inclusivity Officer at Tech Mahindra, blaming her for constant attacks because of his sexual orientation. “I was constantly told that I was effeminate and that it affected my work. And since that was being done by the global head of training, who headed the company’s Anti Sexual Harassment Committee, I had nowhere else to report the incidents,” Pramanik told BusinessLine.
With the Supreme Court decriminalising gay sex by scrapping some provisions of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, questions have arisen about how corporate houses are dealing with gender diversity.
Pramanik, who was Asssistant Manager for Training, said the bullying had a cascading effect on the team’s culture. “As the top boss expressed so much hatred towards homosexuals, even the other team-mates started bullying me. It was turning into an organisation culture.” 
As Pramanik took to Twitter to share his trauma, M&M Chairman Anand Mahindra responded to him, promising prompt action. “I can categorically assure you that we celebrate diversity in our workplace. Our Code of Conduct is explicit on this subject...TechM is investigating these allegations, and appropriate action will follow...” Mahindra wrote.
Even CP Gurnani, CEO at Tech Mahindra, responded: “Gaurav, you have my personal assurance that this will be thoroughly investigated. We remain committed to supporting and promoting a diverse workforce at TechM.” Pramanik confirmed that he was approached by Tech Mahindra to initiate an inquiry. 
Experts believe that a diversity policy alone is inadequate to ensure a conducive work environment for sexual minorities. “Start-ups understand LGBTQ culture, but conventional companies, even in the tech world, treat it as taboo. Earlier, it was a clear barrier but since the Supreme Court judgåément, there’s a silent barrier. India is still living in the 18th century. It will take several years for the biases to change in the country. The Supreme Court verdict is just the stepping stone,” said Kris Lakshmikanth, CEO at The Head Hunters India."

Tech Mahindra won the contract on a tender issued by the Indian Ports Association (IPA) to build a common shared platform on behalf of Kolkata Port Trust, Paradip Port Trust, Chennai Port Trust, Mumbai Port Trust and Deendayal Port Trust (formerly Kandla Port Trust), the shipping ministry said.
The EBS is aimed at improving India’s ranking in ease of doing business, enabling faster request processing in delivery of services with better turnaround time, reduction in manual intervention/documentation required, reduction in overall transaction time and costs, improve the efficiency of port operations, quick turn round of vessels and subsequent less dwell time, dashboard to ports/ministry of shipping for real-time management information system (MIS) on cargo/ship movements and export-import (EXIM) transactions, simplified and accelerated procedures for cargo entry, exit or transit and enhanced transparency across systems.
The project implementation and stabilisation period is twenty months and operations and maintenance support is for five years.
Tech Mahindra will partner with SAP, Envision, CISCO, Dell and RTCom to roll-out the EBS for the five port trusts.
The proposed EBS will comprise three core solution components - port operations solution, standard ERP solutions and auxiliary solutions and would tightly integrate with the Port Community System (PCS) and other retained applications of ports, enterprise business standard processes and shared infrastructure on cloud, making it next generation modern system which will serve ports purpose in coming years.
The system would be driven by transparent, simple and error-free business processes, easily measured by clearly defined key performance indicators, use latest technology to achieve strategic business objectives and integrate seamlessly with prevalent systems and devices. The solution proposes a cafeteria approach for ports, which allows them to select the systems that they want to be implemented as per their needs. This model enables a minimal effort in a seamless manner if new ports opt to join the system in near future.
Other Central government ports such as Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, Cochin Port Trust, New Mangalore Port Trust, Mormugao Port Trust, V O Chidambaranar Port Trust, Visakhapatnam Port Trust and Kamarajar Port Ltd already run an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system which they built on their own.
An official with one of the port trusts said that the staff strength at major port trusts will reduce further as repetitive jobs will stop. The shipping ministry has frozen recruitment of workers at Class 3 level for more than a decade.
“Employee strength will come down further as repetitive jobs will get computerised. The beauty of ERP is that it gives end-to-end solutions as all departments will get integrated making information and data readily available resulting in easier decision-making,” the official said."

As the cyber-threat landscape grows sophisticated and spending increases, IT services firm Tech Mahindra has partnered with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to tap into the growing cyber security market.
The partnership will leverage the technological capability of IAI and Tech Mahindra’s global presence and expertise across industries to offer services to enterprise consumers in India and abroad.
IAI is Israel’s prime aerospace and aviation manufacturer with a cybersecurity division that comprises the largest consortium of cybersecurity companies.
‘Winning combination’
Speaking to media persons here on Wednesday, CP Gurunani, Managing Director, Tech Mahindra, said that with cyberthreats on the rise, there is a huge business opportunity. The partnership, Gurunani said, will “create skills in cyber security and a platform for cyber warfare.”
Agreeing with Gurunani, Esti Peshin, Vice-President and General Manager, IAI’s Cyber Division, said: “Cyber security has become prominent and our dependence on the network is making us vulnerable.” To combat that, Peshin said, one needs to have technology, proven methodology, cyber innovation, collaboration and capacity building. This is exactly what the partnership brings to the table. While Israel brings the technology and innovation, Tech Mahindra has the methodology in place and also scale with their presence in 90 countries. “It is a winning combination,” Peshin added.
According to reports, the cyber security market is one of the fastest growing and estimated to be over $96 billion, worldwide. After the US, Israel is No 2 when it comes to innovation in cyber security. Maya Kadosh, acting Ambassador of Israel in India, said all these factors give a fillip to the partnership. “This partnership will go a long way. We will look for a joint venture with Tech Mahindra for developing solutions,” she added.
Rajiv Singh, Senior Vice-President and Global Head of Cyber security Unit, Tech Mahindra, said: “Currently we are looking into our existing portfolio and plugging the gaps.” The focus is on skilling and reskilling the workforce on cyber security, which will be combination of training employees on the platform and also interaction with experts."

CP Gurnani, CEO and MD, Tech Mahindra


 IT firm Tech Mahindra on Tuesday said its consolidated net profit has increased 27.2 per cent to Rs 1,064.3 crore for the second quarter ended September 30.
This is against a net profit of Rs 836.2 crore in the July-September 2017 quarter, Tech Mahindra said in a statement.
The company’s revenue from operations was up by 13.4 per cent to Rs 8,629.8 crore during the said quarter as compared to Rs 7,606.4 crore in the year-ago period.
In dollar terms, the net profit was up nearly 15.6 per cent to USD 149.4 million, while revenue rose by 3.3 per cent to the USD 1.21 billion in the second quarter.
“It’s been a satisfying quarter where our focus on digital transformation has helped us deliver a robust performance. Our strong deal wins especially in the communication vertical coupled with our 10 per cent-plus sequential growth in digital revenues are a validation of our Run, Change and Grow strategy,” Tech Mahindra CEO and MD CP Gurnani said.
He added that barring declines in implementation business in its healthcare vertical, the company clocked a good quarter in terms of both revenue growth and EBIDTA margin improvement.
“We will endeavour to maintain this momentum as we continue our journey,” he said.
Cash and cash equivalent stood at Rs 7,900 crore as of September 2018, while its active client count was at 930.
The company added 4,839 people in the September quarter taking the total headcount to 118,391. The software headcount was at 72,534 people, while that in BPO was 39,407 employees.
“This has been a strong quarter with improving operating metrics across most of our business lines. Our focus on optimizing our operations has led us to the highest EBITDA level and margin improvement in excess of 2 per cent sequentially and 4 per cent on a year-on-year basis,” Tech Mahindra CFO Manoj Bhat said."

Our Bureau IT services firm Tech Mahindra reported a 27.2 per cent jump in net profit at ₹1,064 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, driven by rupee depreciation and efficiency improvements. The firm made ₹836.2- crore net profit in the same quarter last year.
Tech Mahindra’s revenue from operations was up 13.4 per cent to ₹8,629.8 crore during the quarter (₹7,606.4 crore).
In dollar terms, the net profit was up nearly 15.6 per cent to $149.4 million, while revenue rose 3.3 per cent to $1.21 billion in the quarter.
The company gained 80 basis points from currency depreciation while earning another 120 basis points from efficiency improvements. 
Its digital revenue share went up to 31 per cent in the quarter under review from the previous sequential quarter. “I am very happy with not only our digital footprint but also with our operating margins. I’m quite confident that because of the large deals we’ve won last quarter, which made it our best quarter in terms of winning deals, it gives me confidence that communications business is bouncing back,” Tech Mahindra CEO and Managing Director CP Gurnani said.
Tech Mahindra won three deals in the communications business worth about $300 million. 
Gurnani said the decline in the enterprise business was caused by the drop in healthcare revenue and barring that all other verticals performed well. The company had in the past indicated there would be a decline as two large projects came to a closure. 
“In terms of enterprise business, if I take out the healthcare revenue, the growth was about 2.6 per cent quarter on quarter,” Gurnani said. “Our margins have been improving quarter-on-quarter and we believe we still have scope to improve them further,” he said. Gurnani said 5G auctions in Europe will help fuel more investments in the communications business where companies are going beyond telecommunication technologies and looking at building media and entertainment platforms as well.
Tech Mahindra is also building a 5G centre of excellence for the Japanese market, Gurnani said.
Cash and cash-equivalent for the company stood at ₹7,900 crore as of September 30, while its active client count was at 930.
The company added 4,839 people in the September quarter taking the total headcount to 118,391. The software headcount was at 72,534, while that in BPO was 39,407.

 Fifth biggest domestic tech company Tech Mahindra is looking at upcoming 5G rollouts in global markets as a big opportunity and is on the right trajectory in its communications vertical to achieve ‘gradual growth’ from now on, a top official has said.
In the recent past, communications, which has traditionally been the mainstay for the company, had delivered mixed results due to difficulties faced by the sector around the world, but the company surprised with a 4 per cent growth in revenue in the September quarter compared to the preceding three months.
“On the telecom side, our visibility is that it will show a gradual growth from now on, the trajectory is right and we should be able to sustain it,” chief executive and managing director C P Gurnani told PTI recently.
He, however, made it clear that achieving 4 per cent growth quarter-on-quarter is not possible.
The communication vertical accounted for 41.5 per cent of its Rs 8,629 crore revenue in the September quarter. The revenue share of the segment had stood at 45.2 per cent in Q1FY18, which had steadily declined to 39.6 per cent by Q1FY19 before going up.
Gurnani singled out the upcoming 5G technologies as an opportunity for the company to grow, saying many countries have allocated spectrum in the newest technology to telcos.
He said the ability to offer virtualisation is a strength that TechM has in the segment and it will be bidding for upcoming contracts.
When asked about the domestic telecom business, Gurnani said all the companies have invested in spectrum and will be looking at monetising their investments at some point of time, but declined to specify an outlook.
Even though he did not wish to give a guidance on revenue growth, Gurnani said the company is committed to grow at 8-10 per cent per year.
Hiring
Chief operating officer L Ravichandran said hiring has not grown in proportion to the revenue growth due to greater automation and added that a bulk of the recent hiring has been of freshers.
The company has hired 3,000 in the first half of the fiscal, including 2,200 in the first quarter, he said, adding it is looking to hire more people.
The company is working on ways to up the margins, including automation, increasing utilisation, more efforts on training so that employees can start working on projects quickly and pursuing the right business mix, he said."

After the recent Tech Mahindra analyst meet, we are more enthusiastic about its medium-term growth prospects than near-term ones. 5G testing has started in the US while revenue for the operator is likely to start only in FY21. While near-term growth prospects for the enterprise segment rely on project pipeline revival for HCI (an acquisition in healthcare) and traction in manufacturing (which is seeing a good pick up in spending in the US and Europe), medium-term enterprise growth can be driven by 5G adoption. That could also be when TechM develops differentiation in the enterprise space versus peers.
Near-term growth is likely to be slightly below peers. Management has guided for single-digit growth in the communications vertical, excluding 5G, and 8-9 per cent growth on enterprise-side for FY20. We retain our estimates and reiterate ‘Buy’ with a target price of ₹850 on 14x FY20E P/E."

Sujit Baksi, President, India Business & Corporate Affairs Tech Mahindra


With digitisation growing across sectors and increased transparency in government dealings offering better opportunities, Indian IT firm Tech Mahindra, whose concentration till recently was on international markets such as Europe and the US, is now shifting focus to the Indian market.
The company established a strategic business unit structure recently, and has put in place a dedicated delivery team. 
Speaking to BusinessLine at the sidelines of an event here on Tuesday, Sujit Baksi, Tech Mahindra President, India Business and Corporate Affairs, said: “One of the reasons why we were not in India earlier was due to lack of transparency. But in the last 8-10 quarters it is improving.”
“We took a decision in March 2017 to look at the business here because of the nature of deals coming in,” Baksi added. 
Indian IT market accounts for about $85 billion and is growing at the rate of nine per cent, propelled by the government’s digitisation drive. This presents huge business opportunity for businesses. For Tech Mahindra, the Indian market accounts for about five per cent of the total revenue. The company’s total revenue is about $4.9 billion. The company aims to double its Indian revenue in the next few years.
Since the beginning of dedicated India operations six months ago, the company has seen large government projects for modernisation, huge opportunities for improving customer experience in the e-commerce space, and IT transformation projects involving enterprises customers such as banks and telecom players.
The mid-cap IT major recently signed a ₹270-crore deal with Coal India for digital transformation for a period of five years. The deal includes supply and implementation of the Hospital Information Management System, across all eight subsidiaries of Coal India covering 21 hospitals. 
It also won a tender issued by the India Ports Association to modernise and automate ports for five central government-owned ports.
The company has already tied up with two large telecom players for IT transformation and customer experience in the wallet space. 
In the e-commerce space, the company is working to improve customer experience. “But we are very selective about the projects in both government and enterprise side,” said Baksi.
For instance, payments are still a huge challenge with the government. “So what we do is we work with the government while the Request for Proposal is being made,” Baksi said.
“We ensure the payment terms are favourable to us with any vendor they choose. If the payment terms do not meet the internal norms, we walk out from the deal. We don’t even bid. We are selective about the projects we work on,” he added."

Communication vertical organic dollar revenues (ex-LCC) remained tepid for three consecutive years (up 0.5 per cent CAGR over FY15-FY18). 
We believe that the worst is behind for communication vertical and recent large deal wins in 1HFY19 should render stability for this vertical performance. While telecom pick up has already been visible in 2QFY19, we expect turnaround in this segment performance in 2HFY19 and FY20E as well.

52,2018-12-24,Tech Mahindra,"Lessons from Tech Mahindra on workplace diversity
Last fortnight, the information technology company came in for some unflattering attention on social media over issues relating to workplace diversity, and although the final resolution of the matter earned it some credit, the entire episode has many teachable moments for all businesses.
A former Tech Mahindra employee made public a letter he had written to the company’s head of training in early September, in which he called out her “bigotry” targeting sexual and religious minorities. He said he felt inspired to write the letter following the recent Supreme Court verdict decriminalising gay sex. That letter went viral on social media platforms, and Tech Mahindra drew flak. The outrage was compounded by a searing irony.
The head of training was also Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer!
With alacrity. MD and CEO CP Gurnani immediately tweeted to say that the company would investigate the matter, and Group Head Anand Mahindra too offered public assurances of the company’s commitment to workplace diversity.
With a speedy in-house investigation, followed by the dismissal of the executive concerned.
Like I said, Tech Mahindra’s post-facto response was swift, and was applauded. But it says something about the failure of in-house checks and balances that such a person, with extreme views on everything from politics to social issues had made it to the top rungs of a global company (as Chief Diversity Officer, no less). And that she very likely torpedoed the careers of several others during her tenure. In fact, given that she was prone to Twitter rants about, among other things, “killing Kejriwal” and about Islam, it’s a wonder the company wasn’t alerted earlier.
Everyone is free to have political opinions, even extreme ones — although it is hard to defend homicidal rants on an open platform. Which is why companies that care about how they are perceived do lay down guidelines for employees’ public articulations on social media platforms. And, yes, to the extent that such a world-view influences employees’ at-work behaviour, and brings reputational damage to the employers, companies have a responsibility to ensure that executives in key leadership positions are not poisoning the well.
That’s a slippery slope I woudn’t recommend. Personality tests, such as the Myers-Briggs test and the Holland Code Career Test, are occasionally used in workplaces, but such tests have been discredited: they overly stereotype personalities and are sometimes “weaponised” in a way that harms organisational culture. But in this case, the executive’s bigotry was on very public display: the organisation just needed to have its eyes and ears open, and perhaps to have institutionalised an in-house feedback loop mechanism that triggers alerts.
There are countless studies to establish that diversity — not just on the lines of ethnicity, gender and sexual identities, but even “cognitive diversity” — enriches workplaces and enhances group outcomes. 
As complexity scientist Scott Page, author of The Diversity Bonus and The Difference, notes, “Diverse cities are more productive, diverse boards of directors make better decisions, and the most innovative companies are diverse.” In effect, bigoted executives who impair workplace diversity do the company a disservice.

 The Hyderabad High Court on Monday set aside an Enforcement Directorate order provisionally attaching ₹822 crore worth of fixed deposits belonging to Satyam Computer Services Ltd, which was acquired by Tech Mahindra. 
In 2012, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had issued provisional attachment orders freezing fixed deposits of Satyam (now merged into Tech Mahindra) in connection with its probe in the money laundering case.
 The agency provisionally attached the amount alleging that it was ill-gotten proceeds of Satyam Computers.
 A bench of Justices V Ramasubramanian and J Uma Devi Monday set aside the ED’s orders.
 Vivek Reddy, counsel for Tech Mahindra, told PTI they argued that there was no money when the Tech Mahindra took over the fraud-hit Satyam Computer Services Ltd (SCCL) in 2009 and on the other hand, the Mahindra group company had to infuse money to revive the B Ramalinga Raju-founded company.
 “Our argument was that there was no proceeds of money when Tech Mahindra (TechM) took over the company (SCSL). There was no money in the company then and they (TechM) had to infuse money into the company.
 “So where is the question of any ill-gotten money when the company had negative balance?” he said.
 P V P Suresh Kumar, representing the ED, said the agency might approach the Supreme Court challenging the high court’s order.
 “One of the strongest grounds (for an appeal in the apex court) was that the CBI special court had earlier convicted Ramalinga Raju and brothers.
 “In view of that conviction, it clearly shows that there was a contravention of the Money Laundering Act and IPC provisions. In such a situation, the attachment order passed by the Enforcement Directorate was valid and correct, according to the contravention,” Kumar said.
 “The ED will approach the Supreme Court after going through the order copy,” he said.
 Earlier, a single bench judge had stayed all further proceedings pursuant to the ED’s attachment order.
 Challenging the single judge order, the investigating agency had filed a writ appeal before a division bench.
 The bench had on December 31, 2014 issued orders dismissing the ED’s appeal, saying the act of the agency was contrary to rules.
 Tech Mahindra argued that it was a victim of fraud and no proceedings could go under the provisions of the PMLA against “victims of fraud”. 
The ED had attached the accounts of SCCL as its probe claimed to have found that B Ramalinga Raju and his associates “wrongfully” offloaded inflated shares of the company by way of sale or pledging of shares. 
A trail of loans derived from front companies revealed that ₹822 crore out of ₹ 2,171.45 crore found their way to Satyam Computers and were used for day-to-day expenses like payment of salaries among others, the ED had said in its order."

Jagdish Mitra, who was recently promoted to lead the enterprise businesses of Tech Mahindra from Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, is clear about where the next avenue of growth is. It includes sectors such as agri tech and oil and gas. Excerpts from his interaction with the BusinessLine:
You mentioned that agri-tech is one of your key focus, which is also one of the fastest growing sectors with many start-ups coming into this space. On the other hand Mahindra & Mahindra is one of the leaders in the sector. Would that give you an advantage?
Some of the synergies we are trying to drive with Mahindra & Mahindra include agri-tech. The technology from IoT perspective is coming from us. We have created at least four or five business propositions jointly with the parent company. 
Significant investment in double digits has been made this space and we have been working on this for the past 18-24 months. Most of the roadblocks are the start-up challenges and the partner ecosystem. 
However we do have the advantage of partner ecosystem from the parent company.
Can you talk about the solutions you are working on in agri-tech space?
Opportunities that lie in this space are related to farmer productivity. That’s the core area of solutions in this space. 
What we are doing in this area is using enabling technologies with sensors and soil detection technology to be able to predict productivity of farms. 
That is really what we have done. We have rolled out solutions both in India and overseas with fairly large companies, multinationals, in stealth mode to improve farm productivity.
What are the other focus areas? Can you elaborate on how you are going to implement this?
Areas such as agri and oil and gas are new age areas and the way to look at is the new verticals that we are continuing to invest for the future. 
We are also seeing if we can scale up our smaller business verticals such as utility.
Three big areas we are focusing on and where we have made huge investments are artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and cyber security. 
For example, in AI we are working with approximately 20 start-ups. 
These start-ups cut across horizontals also. In cybersecurity we are working with 12 start-ups very aggressively."
35,2019-01-26,Tech Mahindra,"2019 to be growth year for Indian IT: Gurnani 


CP Gurnani, CEO and MD, Tech Mahindra

 The Indian Information Technology sector faces global headwinds like Brexit but developments around Globalisation 4.0 and 5G technology will bring growth for the industry this year, Tech Mahindra’s Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) C P Gurnani said.
He also flagged currency risks, but added that the domestic IT sector will benefit from investments in digital.
“Uncertainty and lack of clarity around the US shutdown and Brexit are risks for the IT industry. However, the IT sector is poised for future growth, with technology being the key enabler for Globalization 4.0. Technology is at the core of everything we do, be it solving the skill problem or sustainability issues,” Gurnani said.
Meanwhile, United State (US) President Donald Trump on Friday backed a deal to temporarily end the record-breaking government shutdown despite getting no funding for his controversial plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.
The deal resolved the crippling 35-day closure but not the fight over his proposed border wall.
“While US accounts for 60 per cent of the Indian IT spend, for Tech Mahindra, 45-46 per cent business comes from US. We also have other currencies to battle. Every currency has its own equation with the US currency and hence, it all balances out in the end. The impact of the current geopolitical issues, if any, is likely to be two to three quarters away. I would wait and watch before drawing any conclusion,” he said.
Britain is set to exit the 28-member European Union (EU) on March 29. But with just over two months to go, Britain is still undecided on a roadmap, which has led to uncertainties for businesses and the global economy as a whole.
Gurnani, who served as chairman of IT industry body NASSCOM in 2016-17, said the Indian IT sector is betting big on Globalization 4.0 where global trade will be shaped mainly by the use of technology.
“Despite global slowdown, India has witnessed robust growth and is poised to become the fifth largest economy in the world. Together with Asia, India has a critical role to play in Globalization 4.0, and it is important for us to sustain the momentum,” he said.
According to Gartner estimates, India’s IT spending will grow by 6.7 per cent in 2019 to $89 billion. Increasing spending on three segments -- devices, enterprise software and IT services -- will give a major boost to IT spending levels in India in 2019, it said.
“2019 will be the year of growth as the IT industry invests aggressively in digital. The future is now, and it is all about being agile and being able to deliver better customer and citizen services. The economy is being driven by millennials that has led to a huge demand in data and data services. Using data for personalization and customization of services will hold the key,” Gurnani said.
He also said Tech Mahindra is betting big on emerging technologies like 5G, blockchain, artificial intelligence, deep machine learning and quantum computing and will continue to focus on strategic acquisitions to scale faster.
“The future of innovation depends on the successful roll-out and implementation of 5G. Networks are at the heart of accelerating digital transformation and a fully functional 5G network will deliver unprecedented productivity gains. After 18 months, 5G will take the centre stage in the tech world and all our conversations will be about digital and 5G,” he said."
34,2019-02-05,Tech Mahindra,"Tech Mahindra Q3 PAT up 27.5% 
 IT company Tech Mahindra on Tuesday posted a 27.5 per cent increase in consolidated profit after tax (PAT) to ₹ 1,203 crore in the December 2018 quarter.
 The company’s consolidated revenue from operations increased 15 per cent to ₹ 8,944 crore, against ₹ 7,776 crore in the year-ago quarter.

 IT major Tech Mahindra reported a 27.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit to ₹1,203 crore for the third quarter ended December 31 as the company continued to improve its margins.
The revenue for the quarter rose 15 per cent to ₹8,944 crore as against ₹8,629 in the same quarter last year. Digital revenues contributed 33 per cent of the company’s revenues in the quarter. 
With the growth seen in the third quarter, Tech Mahindra now has a revenue runrate of $5 billion. In US dollar terms, revenue was at $1.26 billion, up 4.3 per cent year on year.
Tech Mahindra has seen its margins improve for seven straight quarters, thanks to its focus on cost reduction, automation and use of platforms. In the third quarter, EBITDA margins were up 50 basis points to 19.3 per cent. This was also aided by rupee depreciation. Margins were at a four-year high. 
“This is a milestone quarter for Tech Mahindra with $5 billion annual revenue run rate in sight,” CP Gurnani, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Tech Mahindra said. “Our Run, Change and Grow strategy has helped us deliver a strong 10 per cent sequential growth in digital revenues. We are confident of continuing the growth momentum.”
Gurnani said the company’s goal to improve margins for 6-8 quarters is on track and while he expects the growth in margins to slow down, they will continue to improve. Guranani termed year 2019 as the year of 5G trials. He said the company expects increased spending from telcos globally even as cost pressures on them are on the rise. In the quarter, Tech Mahindra bagged deals worth $450 million, of which $250 million came from the telecom vertical. 
Gurnani said the company is focusing on acquisitions that’ll both improve Tech Mahindra’s capabilities and increase its scale. 
“We will continue to look for both scale- and capability-focussed acquisitions. The size of the acquisition will not be a gating criterion. What will be a gating criterion is the return on opportunity and impact on operational matrix,” said Vivek Aggarwal, global head for enterprise vertical solutions and portfolio companies.

5,2019-09-23,Tech Mahindra,"Corporate tax cuts: Stocks that gain the most
Earnings growth for India Inc, which has been on first gear in recent times, is all set to receive a boost from lower tax outgo, with the reduced corporate tax rates. For many manufacturing companies, the savings on this front could give them room to reduce prices or improve other spends, thereby spurring demand. Many companies in sectors such as infrastructure, capital goods and FMCG stand to gain. Some others in the auto, steel, oil and gas, and real-estate segments could also get a leg-up. IT companies may be better off under the current regime though, given the lower tax incidence at present.
Most companies in the information technology space will not be enthused by the corporate tax rate cuts announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. There are two reasons. Many companies have an effective corporate tax rate below 25.17 per cent (including surcharge and cess) and they get the benefit of profit-based deductions for exporting their services from special economic zones in India.
Also, IT and software companies that build their own intellectual property get a weighted deduction under the income-tax laws on the R&D expenses that they have incurred to build their IP.
Now, such companies might have to pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) calculated on their book profits.
The Finance Minister has slashed MAT from 18.5 per cent to 15 per cent. That puts the effective tax rate, including surcharge, for companies paying MAT at 17.5 per cent compared with 21.6 per cent earlier.
This means that IT companies that get tax deductions on their export revenues earned from operating in SEZs, and pay MAT, wouldn’t want to opt out of claiming these deductions. They would also have to forego the weighted deduction on R&D that brings down the effective corporate tax rate.
Besides, if they opt for the lower effective corporate tax rate of 25.2 per cent, they will have to take a one-time charge of any MAT credit that might be in their books.
In 2018-19, out of the top-tier IT companies in the S&P BSE IT Index, only Infosys (26 per cent) had an effective tax rate of over 25 per cent at the standalone level, while TCS (21.3 per cent), HCL Technologies (23.7 per cent), Wipro (23.02 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (19.6 per cent) had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
Even most mid-tier IT companies such as Mphasis (20.5 per cent), Hexaware (22.3 per cent), Mindtree (24.9 per cent), L&T Infotech (21.7 per cent) and L&T Technology Services (24.2 per cent), had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
In all, IT companies won’t be rushing to opt out of their export-based tax incentives until the benefit of paying lower taxes on export revenues runs out.
With major players such as Hindustan Unilever, Nestle, Britannia, GSK Consumer and Colgate-Palmolive suffering an effective tax of 32-36 per cent, the FMCG segment could be a beneficiary of the new 25.17 per cent tax rate.
At the same time, home-grown companies such as Dabur, Jyothy Labs, Godrej Consumer, Bajaj Consumer and Marico may not choose to move to the new regime, considering that their effective tax rates are either on a par with or lower than 25.17 per cent.
Overall, for shareholders in FMCG stocks, this move could result in the 2018-19 profits of listed FMCG players, on an aggregate, inching up by 9 per cent.
However, FMCG companies can choose to retain a portion of the benefits to increase advertising spends and/or pass it on as price cuts to boost demand. In the quarter-ended June 2019, for instance, major FMCG companies clocked single-digit growth in sales due to poor volumes.
Going by the 2018-19 numbers, Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motors and Maruti Suzuki and Eicher Motors have an effective tax rate of 29-33 per cent and could benefit from the reduced rates. However, the rates of Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland, are much lower. Taking M&M ‘s reported tax expenses (standalone) for 2018-19, the effective tax rate is only at 24.17 per cent (21.3 per cent, considering the current year's tax expense alone).
The company also has a MAT credit of ₹1,116.35 crore in its books as on March 31, 2019. Ashok Leyland’s effective tax rate, given the reported tax expense for 2018-19, is 20.6 per cent (15.14 per cent taking the current year's expense alone). The company has availed itself of benefit to the extent of ₹233 crore on tax concessions and tax holidays in 2018-19 and has MAT credit on its books.
In such cases, companies may choose to continue under the current regime till the tax holiday/concessions exist. Since MAT also continues at a reduced rate of 15 per cent, these companies can choose to pay tax as per normal rates or as per MAT, whichever is higher — as has been the case until now. MAT credit can also be set off against the tax liability in future years.
Among auto ancillaries, MNC players such as SKF India, Goodyear and Bosch that have high effective tax rates of 33-36 per cent could be major beneficiaries. Put together, listed companies in the auto and auto ancillaries space may see a 3-5 per cent addition to their profits of 2018-19, if they choose to avail themselves of the 25.17 per cent tax rate.
For infrastructure companies, the effective tax rates in FY19, after taking into account all eligible exemptions and tax holidays, work out to 27-35 per cent of their standalone PBT. For companies such as Engineers India, Ircon International, Ashoka Buildcon and RITES, availing themselves of the lower tax rate of 25.17 per cent could translate to a 14-18 per cent jump in earnings, going forward. Whereas, giants such as Larsen & Toubro and IRB Infra developers could witness only a 2 and 5 per cent rise in PAT led by tax savings.
Among the pure construction players, NCC, Welspun and Sadhbav Engg could benefit. Certain companies have effective tax rates of less than 25 per cent, which can be on account of payment of minimum alternate tax, or availing themselves of benefits of differential depreciation on fixed assets under the IT Act. The effects of the amendments announced will hence have to be evaluated on a case-to-case basis.
For instance, Dilip Buildcon has an effective tax rate of 16 per cent in FY19 on account of MAT provisions (inferred from the annual report). Hence, the lowered MAT rates could bring down its effective tax rate further, and the company would also get the existing MAT credit entitlement.
On the other hand, Adani Port and SEZ now enjoy an effective tax rate of 21 per cent, after availing itself of deductions under Section 80IAB of the Income Tax Act for 10 years, with effect from FY07-08. This apart, it has several subsidiaries and joint ventures that can get tax holiday benefits under Section 80IA.
The company is also likely to benefit from the grandfathering of taxes on buyback, as the management had made a public announcement of the share buyback of ₹1,960 crore on June 4, 2019.
Among the cement manufacturers, the effective tax rate in FY19 for most companies (on a standalone basis) is less than 25 per cent — they may refrain from foregoing their exemptions and deductions. This includes large players like Ultratech and Shree Cement. However, there could be savings in PAT in the range of 11-15 per cent for Himadri, Deccan and India Cements if they opt for the subsidised rates, as their current effective tax rate is more than 25.17 per cent.
The impact of the lower corporate tax on the steel industry is expected to be mixed, at least in the near future.
The tax incidence on companies such as Tata Steel, Kalyani Steels and Jindal Stainless Hisar in FY19 was 39 per cent, 33 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively. Note that these are the tax rates after taking into account the tax exemptions that the companies are eligible for. Thus, these companies stand to gain in a big way if they opt for the reduced tax rate of 22 per cent (25.17 per cent including surcharge and cess).
Companies such as JSW Steel and Tata Metaliks with effective tax rates of 20 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, may not opt for the reduced tax rate immediately. Meanwhile, SAIL, Jindal Steel and Uttam Galva had zero current tax for FY19. This could be either due to companies making losses in FY19 or accumulated losses from previous years, setting off the year’s profits. If the new reduced tax rate is opted, setting-off of losses will not be possible, making it unattractive. However, in the long run, when the companies turn profitable or become eligible to pay MAT, they can opt for the new tax rates, which could reduce their tax outgo.
The move to reduce corporate tax seems largely positive for real-estate companies reeling under pressure due to tight liquidity in the market. For most realty companies, the effective tax rate is higher than 25.17 per cent (including cess and surcharge), based on standalone profit before tax. For instance, for Oberoi Realty and Ashiana Housing, the current tax rate is 29 per cent, while for Kolte-Patil, it works out to around 45 per cent.
These companies, if they adopt the new corporate tax regime, could improve their earnings, even if they forego their exemptions and MAT credit.
If players pass on the benefit to home buyers, it could spur demand in the market.
But for companies such as Sunteck Realty and Prestige Estate Properties, for which the effective current year tax rates work out to less than 5 per cent, and Brigade Enterprises and Sobha with 23 per cent rate, continuing with the existing tax structure may be better.
For the oil and gas sector, the cut in corporate tax rate seems largely positive. Going by their FY19 standalone financials, the effective tax rate for most companies in the sector is higher than the 25.17 per cent rate (including surcharge and cess) that will apply to them now. For instance, in FY19, the current tax provision of city gas distributors Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas was about 31 per cent of their profit before tax.
The effective tax rate for the PSU hydrocarbon explorers, ONGC and Oil India, and gas transmitter GAIL (India) was 27-28 per cent, while it was about 29 per cent for PSU refiner HPCL. The highest tax rate — about 32 per cent — was borne by Gujarat-based gas transmitter GSPL. For the above companies, the new tax rate of 22 per cent plus surcharge of 10 per cent and cess of 4 per cent — totalling 25.17 per cent — should translate into lower tax outgo. Even if these companies have to give up some investment-based tax exemptions and credit of minimum alternate tax carried forward from earlier years, they should be better off under the new tax rate regime.
On the other hand, there are a few companies such as Reliance Industries, PSU refiners Indian Oil and BPCL, and gas importer Petronet LNG that may not benefit from the new tax rate. In FY19, the current tax provision of Reliance Industries, Indian Oil and BPCL was about 20 per cent of their profit before tax — this is lower than the new effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
It is the same case for Petronet LNG, which had an effective tax rate of about 24 per cent last year. For these companies, it may be worthwhile continuing with their existing tax structure, taking the benefits, if any, of investment-based tax exemptions, and carried forward MAT credit and carried forward loss.
In the case of Reliance Industries, for instance, while the applicable tax rate in FY19 was 34.94 per cent, it was able to reduce the effective rate (excluding deferred tax adjustments) to about 20 per cent, thanks to exempted income, and additional allowances net of MAT credit.
The company may likely find it more beneficial to continue with this arrangement until the tax breaks that keep the effective tax low are exhausted.
Later, it could shift to the new regime with the effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman opened the liquidity tap for corporates on Friday by announcing a sharp tax cut and leaving more money in their hands for capacity expansion. The statutory tax rate for corporates has been lowered to 22 per cent from 30 per cent. This benefit, though, is only for companies that wish to give up their tax exemptions. Given that most tax incentives and exemptions have been phased out over the past few years, companies may prefer to forego the few they enjoy now, and opt to be taxed at the lower rate of 22 per cent.
New manufacturing companies incorporated after October 1, 2019, can benefit from an even lower rate of 15 per cent tax if they don’t claim the tax benefits they are eligible for. India Inc will also get relief on MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax). The Finance Minister has reduced MAT to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent. This would benefit companies located in SEZ developers, infrastructure, cement companies, companies with units in specified locations in the North-East and exporters. There is also relief on buyback tax.
The 20 per cent tax on buybacks by corporates, which was announced in the Budget on July 5, 2019, would not apply to companies that announced them before the Budget day. According to data from nseinfobase.com, companies, including Sasken Technologies, Greaves Cotton, Welspun Corp, Star Cement and Eris Lifesciences, whose issues are on the way, but were announced before July 5, and for companies such as Infosys, which had buybacks ongoing in July, will benefit from the change. Wipro is also set to benefit as it announced its buyback on June 5.
Companies that pay corporate taxes under the new rates of 15 and 22 per cent will be charged a flat surcharge of 10 per cent, irrespective of their taxable income. The companies that choose the existing regime, availing exemptions and deductions, will have to pay a surcharge only if their total income exceeds ₹1 crore. The rates of surcharge for them will continue to be at 7 per cent and 12 per cent, for total income between ₹1 crore and ₹10 crore and more than ₹10 crore, respectively.
The stock market on Friday cheered the Finance Minister’s move to cut taxes. While companies that are currently paying lower rates due to various deductions and exemptions, such as many information technology players, are unlikely to shift to the new regime, there are many companies across sectors that are likely to see their tax incidence move lower, thus translating to higher profits. If the lower tax incidence is passed on to customers in the form of price cuts, it can help spur demand.
 








 
Ever since the late Finance Minister Arun Jaitley kick-started the process of a phased reduction in corporate tax in 2016-17 and elimination of exemptions, the effective tax rate for India Inc has only gone up.
This is because, while smaller companies were given the benefit of a lower tax rate each year, the phasing out of some tax deductions began impacting the tax outgo of larger companies.
Further, in 2015-16, the Finance Minister also increased the surcharge on corporate tax. That year, for companies with income of up to ₹10 crore, the surcharge was increased to 7 per cent from 5 per cent, and for firms with income above ₹10 crore, it was increased to 12 per cent from 10 per cent. Thus, the effective tax rate in 2017-18 came to 29.49 per cent; it was 23.22 per cent in 2013-14. This increase — evident in the numbers of the past one year — was due to larger companies coughing up more.
In 2017-18, the effective tax rate for companies making profit of more than ₹500 crore was 26.3 per cent; in 2016-17, it was 23.94 per cent. The effective tax rate for smaller companies making profit of ₹1-10 crore came down to 27.38 per cent from 29.2 per cent. So far, withdrawal of tax exemptions has made the effective tax rate of larger companies move higher. It is from here on that these companies will start benefiting.
Now, all companies that are willing to give up their tax incentives can pay taxes at a fairly lower rate of 22 per cent.
 
India is now among the countries that have a low corporate tax rate, and can compete better globally. For the current year, KPMG data show that the statutory tax rate in Myanmar is 25 per cent; in Malaysia, it is 24 per cent; 25 per cent in Indonesia and Korea and 28 per cent in Sri Lanka. Even Chinese companies cough up more — as they pay a tax of 25 per cent — and in Brazil, it is 34 per cent.
The global average corporate tax rate is 23.79 now, and the Asian average is 21.09 per cent. That said, the current move to cut taxes is going to make a hole in the government’s tax kitty. Last year, as per the Budget estimates, the revenue foregone by the Centre on various tax incentives was ₹1.08-lakh crore. Now, with tax cuts, there will be an additional revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore.
 
Bond investors who have been basking in the double-digit return glory over the past year may be in for a bumpy ride ahead. While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s corporate tax rate cut has cheered India Inc and the equity market, the move is a dampener for bond markets.
This is because the revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore owing to the cut will throw the Centre’s fiscal deficit target off track. The RBI’s surplus transfer to the Centre, at best, makes up for the existing shortfall in income tax and GST collections. While higher proceeds from disinvestment and some tax buoyancy (towards the end of the fiscal), on account of the growth-boosting measures, can aid revenues, for now, the ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue loss appears to have left a big hole in the Centre’s kitty. The fiscal deficit target could well move up to 4 per cent (from the projected 3.3 per cent), implying additional borrowings.
Based on the Controller General of Accounts’ (CGA) provisional figures for FY19 (in which income tax grew by a modest 7 per cent), the estimated growth in income tax collections for FY20 works out to 23 per cent. For April-July, CGA data suggest that the growth in net income tax was just about 6 per cent. There is also a significant shortfall in GST collections.
The surplus transfer by the RBI as recommended by the Bimal Jalan Committee has offered a much-needed respite to the Centre in the current fiscal. Excluding the ₹28,000-crore interim dividend already paid by the RBI to the Centre last fiscal, the net transfer in the current financial year amounts to ₹1,48,051 crore. But while optically, the surplus transfer appears to be a massive figure, essentially, it is about ₹60,000 crore above what was estimated in the Budget. Hence, this additional bonanza can help make good the shortfall in tax revenues.
On the disinvestment front, the Centre has set a target of ₹1.05-lakh crore (above the ₹85,000 crore achieved the previous year), which may be achievable. But given that the Centre has been missing its target on spectrum, it is unlikely to meet its estimate of ₹50,500 crore for FY20.
On balance, before the corporate tax rate cut, the Centre could have still pulled off the 3.3 per cent (risk of missing GDP growth assumptions though remained). The substantial ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue foregone on account of the corporate tax rate cut is an additional burden for the Centre that can take its fiscal deficit target to 4 per cent levels.
The joker in the pack is still the underlying growth in the economy. While the real GDP growth has fallen from 8 per cent last year to 5 per cent this fiscal in the April-June quarter, the sharp fall in nominal GDP growth from 12.6 per cent to 8 per cent during this period is worrisome.
The Centre’s fiscal deficit target assumes a 11 per cent growth in nominal GDP growth for FY20 (from the Central Statistics Office’s FY19 estimates), which is a tall task. If growth falters further, the fiscal deficit target can even move beyond 4 per cent levels.
The biggest overhang for Indian bond markets has been the huge gross market borrowings by the Centre pegged at a high ₹7.1-lakh crore in the current fiscal (from ₹5.71-lakh crore last year). But given that the borrowing calendar has been front-loaded, the market was factoring in the easing of supply of bonds in the second half of the fiscal.
For the April-September 2019 period, issuance of government securities amounts to ₹4.42-lakh crore; the balance ₹2.68-lakh crore of gross borrowings will come in the second half. But the supply of bonds in the second half could go up now. The stimulus announced by the Centre would lead to additional borrowings, which implies more supply of bonds and higher yields (bond prices and yields are inversely related).
Going ahead with the foreign sovereign bond issuance could be a saving grace. The ₹70,000-odd crore of foreign sovereign bonds pegged in by most economists can help lower bond yields in the domestic market.
Even though the RBI cut its policy repo rate by a notable 35 basis points in its August policy, Indian bond yields have only inched up. From 6.3 per cent levels in the beginning of August, the yield on 10-year government bonds has increased to 6.6 per cent levels, already factoring in expectations of a fiscal stimulus from the Centre. Post the FM’s move on corporate tax rate, the yield has moved up by another 20 basis points.
Given that expectations of fiscal slippage has been factored into bond yields to some extent, bond yields could remain range-bound in the near term, until there is more clarity on foreign sovereign bond issuance, GST collections and the disinvestment agenda. Expectations of the RBI cutting rates further, given the sanguine inflation trends, may also cap the upside in bond yields. That said, notable rise in yields cannot be ruled out in the coming months, given the significant slip on fiscal deficit and volatile rupee.
Given the uncertainty around various factors impacting bond yields, investors must cap their expectations and tread with caution. Long-term gilt funds as a category has delivered 15-16 per cent returns over the past year, thanks to the sharp rise in bond prices. A rise in yield (fall in prices) hereon can impact returns.
Hence, investors should avoid duration and credit risk in their portfolio. A chunk of your debt fund investments should be in short-term debt funds that carry less volatility in returns. Short- and medium-duration debt funds having a duration of up to 3-4 years are ideal for investors with medium risk appetite. Opt for corporate bond funds that invest a chunk of their assets in high-rated debt instruments."

1,2019-12-15,Tech Mahindra,"Stock query: Tech Mahindra in medium-term uptrend 
Here are the answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
I hold the stocks of Tech Mahindra at ₹757 and Mirza International at ₹82. Kindly let me know when I can exit from these stocks without loss.
Ashok Kulkarni
Tech Mahindra (₹761.4): The stock of Tech Mahindra has been in a long-term uptrend since recording a low of ₹357 in mid-2017.










However, after registering a new high at ₹846 in early May, the stock began to decline. After retracing the 50 per cent retracement of the previous uptrend, the stock found support between ₹600 and ₹610 in August. Subsequently, it changed direction and resumed the uptrend.
Since then, the stock has been in a medium-term uptrend.
But, it encountered a resistance at ₹780 and started to move sideways in early November. The short-term trend is sideways in the range between ₹730 and ₹780. 
A strong break above ₹780 will strengthen the uptrend and take the stock northwards to ₹800 initially and then to ₹840 over the medium term.
A further break above ₹840 will reinforce the long-term uptrend and can pave the way for an up-move to ₹880 or even to ₹900 in the long run.
Investors with a long-term perspective can stay invested with a stop-loss at ₹600.
The medium-term uptrend will remain intact as long as the stock trades above ₹700. You can stay invested with a stop-loss at ₹700 and average the stock in declines. Consider booking partial profit if the stock struggles to move beyond ₹800.
A fall below the immediate support level of ₹730 can pull the stock down to the ₹700-710 zone, which can provide base. 
Only a fall below ₹700 will alter the medium-term uptrend and drag the stock down. The next supports below ₹700 are placed at ₹670 and ₹640 levels.
Mirza International (₹57.5): The long-term downtrend of the stock came to a halt in February, at around ₹50. Thereafter, it began to consolidate sideways in a wide range between ₹50 and ₹68. 










The key support between ₹50 and ₹53 has been consistently providing base for the stock. Last week, it took support from this band and bounced up, gaining 6.4 per cent on Friday.
You can average the stock at the current levels with a stop-loss at ₹48. Consider exiting if it fails to move beyond the long-term resistance in the ₹68-70 zone. However, an emphatic breakthrough of ₹70 will take it higher to ₹80 and then to ₹90 in the long term. On the other hand, if the stock plunges below the lower boundary at ₹50, it will reinforce the downtrend and drag it lower to ₹45 and ₹40 levels. In that case, exit the stock.
