Coal India is slated to end the year with a mere 1.8 per cent production growth at 560-565 million tonnes against a target of 600 mt. Though the off-take increased by 7 per cent, it is barely sufficient to meet demand.
As on March 6, when the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) last published its coal position, power plants are left with just 10 days of stock on an average, and 20 out of the 113 power stations listed by CEA have critical stock (less than seven days). Out of the total, 14 have less than four days of stock.
The coal availability situation remains as bad for the last couple of months.
Non-power customers – fertiliser and cement companies – are also starving. They are getting less coal than last year and are dependent on imports.
Thankfully for them, the price of imported coal dropped and is expected to drop further.
Import price
“Coal prices are coming down as Chinese buying is slowing down.
Price of 4200 GCV (gross as received) Indonesian fuel, which touched $50 a tonne in early February, is now down to $40 a tonne,” says Deepak Kannan, Managing Editor, Asia Thermal Coal, at S&P Global Platts.
Prices fell as China went on a production spree to ensure availability of cheap fuel to power utilities. Coal prices at Quinhuangdao was down from yuan 750 to 600 (FOB) in a matter of days, said Kannan.
Indian importers, he said, were yet to start pre-monsoon stock building, as they are waiting for Indonesian prices to drop further.
Data available with the railways shows imported coal movement was up by nearly 22 per cent from 69 mt to 84 mt till February. This is not the total imports volume as coal moves by road to port-based users.
RE, a saviour
The coal crisis could have hit the power sector harder had not renewable energy (RE) generation, especially wind and solar power generation,increased significantly this year.
According to data available with CEA, renewable energy generation increased by nearly 49 per cent during April-December 2017 against the same period in the previous year. The share of RE in total generation increased from 5.42 per cent to 7.7 per cent.
Out of the total RE generation, 80 per cent came from solar and wind.
RE generation compensated the low 1.86 per cent growth in conventional (thermal, large hydro and nuclear) generation against a 4.4 per cent rise in total generation.
As of January, coal-based generation is a little below (99 per cent) the targeted levels, while large hydro (91 per cent) is way behind.
Nuclear generation increased significantly, but it contributes barely 2 per cent of demand.
Outlook
With off-take expected to reach somewhere near 585 mt, CIL is expected to end the year with approximately 50 mt of stock, down from 68 mt as on March 31, 2017.
It is to be seen to what extent the company is able to meet the additional demand for fuel in summer when electricity demand peaks, but coal production slows down (from the winter run rate of approximately 2 mt a day) due to restrictions imposed by producing States on outdoor work.
Company sources, however, feel the 18-km rail link between Tori and Bhalumath in Jharkhand, which was inaugurated earlier this year, would help evacuate 6-8 mt of fuel from the resource-rich Magadh and Amrapali mines in the next fiscal.
The scheduled opening of the 53 km Jharsuguda-Barapali rail link later this month, connecting the Ib Valley reserves in Odisha, will add another 6-8 mt of fuel."

Coal India Ltd (CIL) is looking to bring down its cost of production in a bid to remain ‘competitive’ at a time when the Centre is opening up the coal sector to commercial mining by private entities.
According to Gopal Singh, Chairman and Managing Director of CIL, the company will focus on bringing down the cost of production by improving productivity and efficiency with a view to maintain its position as market leader.
‘No threat to CIL’
“We are market leaders and we’ll do whatever it takes to remain so,” Singh told newspersons at a press conference here on Friday.
Allowing commercial mining by private entities would not be a threat to CIL. On other hand, it will be an opportunity, he said. According to him, CIL enjoys a monopoly not by choice but by compulsion.
“This is not the first time that CIL’s monopoly is being challenged,” he said.
He was referring to the time when the coal sector was thrown open to the private sector, when they were offered close to 200 captive blocks. However, the exercise was a failure.
CIL, Singh said, will focus on mechanisation, automation and innovation to bring down cost of production. It will also focus on managing its inventory to keep costs lower.
In terms of pricing, CIL’s coal prices have been cheaper by 42-64 per cent compared with imported coal even after the price hike in January 2018, he said.
Capex
The State-owned miner is planning to increase its capital expenditure to ₹9,500 crore in 2018-19 to strengthen production capacity. For the current fiscal, CIL exceeded its planned capital expenditure at ₹8,693 crore; compared with a target of ₹8,500 crore.
According to Singh, a reduction in cost of production translated into 11 per cent increase in profit before tax for CIL during the third quarter of this fiscal.
“We did not take any price hike during the first three quarters this year, the improvement in profitability is mainly on account of reduction in cost of production,” he said."

Coal India (Buy)
CMP: ₹274.4
Target: ₹350
Coal India (CIL) reported 9.4 per cent production growth and 5.5 per cent offtake growth y-o-y in March 2018. Production jumped significantly in March versus the scanty 1-2 per cent growth seen in the previous months of the year. This may have been led by a) offloading of built-up stocks completed by January-February18; and b) low power plant coal stock (still at 10 days) building up on coal demand. Offtake growth remains strong at 5.5 per cent, due to higher coal demand and falling hydro power PLFs (seasonal). 
We remain bullish on the stock from a long-term perspective as even with 5-6 per cent volume growth, CIL can deliver higher earnings growth given the low FY17 base and operating leverage benefit. The recent round of price hikes will add further to the profits. Given the low base of FY17, we estimate PAT CAGR of 36 per cent in FY18-FY20 based on 6-7 per cent offtake growth in FY19-20. The volume pick-up coupled with a price hike to offset the wage hike impact augurs well for earnings growth."

   -  PTI


The Ministry of Coal is looking at a relaxed timeline for the 1 billion tonne coal production target it had set earlier for Coal India.
Speaking at a workshop to formulate the ‘Coal Vision 2030’, Minister for Coal Piyush Goyal said: “It is good news for us that demand has gone up. We can now once again aggressively pursue the 1 billion tonne target. Albeit now 2020 may not have much possibility or meaning because of the two years we lost when there was less demand. But we will work out a revised timeframe based on demand.”
Goyal’s statements come at a time when Coal India and the Railways are being heavily criticised for not supplying enough coal to power plants.
The government in early 2015 had set the target for Coal India to attain the 1 billion tonne of coal production by 2019-2020. A February 2015 official statement had said, “With the projected coal demand of the country hovering around 1,200 million tonnes by 2019-2020, at an envisaged growth rate of 7 per cent, CIL is expected to chip in 1 billion tonne, of which, 908 million tonne is the expected contribution from the identified projects.”
A January 2018 Coal Ministry statement said, “Coal India Limited (CIL) has envisaged enhancing its coal production to the level of 1 billion tonne by 2019-2020 from current level production of 554.14 million tonne in 2016-2017.”
A Coal Ministry official said, “We aim to study the coal demand in the country and accordingly set a target for Coal India. CIL will produce a billion tonne of coal as and when needed between 2020-2030.”
At the event, Goyal also launched the UTTAM App for coal quality monitoring. An official statement said that UTTAM stands for – Unlocking Transparency by Third Party Assessment of Mined Coal.
The portal would give detailed information for coal consumers regarding the Third Party Sampling parameters. The App will give access for monitoring coal quality to individual coal consumers, the statement added."

Methane gas plant (file photo) - By Special Arrangement


 Coal India and its subsidiaries will now be able to extract Coal Bed Methane from its mines without seeking approvals under the Petroleum & Natural Gas Rules 1959 (PNG Rules, 1959).
An official statement said that the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved amending clause 3 (xiii) of the notification dated 03.11.2015 issued by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural gas under Section 12 of the Oil Fields (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 (ORD Act, 1948). 
“Due to this amendment relaxation is granted under the Petroleum & Natural Gas Rules 1959 (PNG Rules, 1959), to Coal India Limited (CIL) and its subsidiaries for not applying for grant of license/lease under the PNG Rules, 1959 for extraction of Coal Bed Methane (CBM) under their Coal Bearing Areas,” the statement added.
The government expects that this will expedite the exploration and exploitation of CBM, enhance the availability of natural gas and reduce the gap in demand and supply of natural gas. 
The government had earlier issued a notification on 03.11.2015 granted rights to CIL and its subsidiaries for exploration and exploitation of CBM from all coal bearing areas for which they possess mining lease for coal.
In another decision, the Cabinet approved the delegation of powers to the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Finance to approve the award of the Blocks/Contract Areas to successful bidders under HELP/OALP after International Competitive Bidding (ICB)."
85,2018-04-11,Coal India,"Relaxation in CBM rule bodes well for Coal India
 
The Union Cabinet on Wednesday relaxed rules for Coal India for extraction of natural gas lying below coal seams in its blocks in a bid to quickly boost production. 
Till now, Coal India had to apply to the oil ministry for a licence to extract coal-bed methane from its coal blocks. Now, the world’s largest coal producer does not need such a permission. 
This will expedite exploration and exploitation of coal-bed methane. The stock of Coal India will remain in focus."

After struggling to meet coal requirements this financial year, Coal India Limited is now committed to meet demand from power generators for the next financial year.
“The Ministry of Power has raised coal demand of 560 million tonnes for the next financial year. Of this, 525 million tonnes is to be supplied by Coal India and we will meet the demand,” a senior Coal India official said.
“We are confident of meeting the demands of power producers as we ramp up our production facilities and improve the coal transportation infrastructure,” he added.
This is a tall claim considering that during financial year 2017-2018, CIL’s dispatch to the power sector stood at 454.30 million tonnes, 6.8 per cent higher than the 425.42 million tonnes it dispatched in 2016-2017.
CIL’s total coal production for financial year 2017-2018 stood at 568.02 million tonnes, while dispatches stood at 580.50 million tonnes. This includes production for non-coal sectors.
“The higher dispatch than production is due to existing inventory being liquidated,” the official added. “CIL opened financial year 2017-2018 with 68.421 million tonnes of coal inventory. This fell to 29.376 million tonnes during November 2017, when coal demand skyrocketed. On April 1, 2018, the inventory is expected to be 54.83 million tonnes.”
CIL aims to dispatch 155.36 million tonne of coal in the first quarter of 2018-2019, according to the company’s dispatch programme.
The company has reported an improvement in profit before tax over the last two sequential quarters of 2017-2018.
“The improvement in profitability is because of enhanced efficiencies. We have gone for a staggered day of rest for workers even as the mines operate all seven days of the week. We have achieved a ₹53 per tonne reduction in coal production costs,” the official said.
“The capital expenditure target for 2017-2018 has also been breached. This stood at ₹8,693 crore compared to a target of ₹8,500 crore for the current financial year,” he added."

The Coal Ministry on Friday appointed Suresh Kumar, Additional Secretary of Coal, as the part-time Chairman and Managing Director of Coal India Ltd with immediate effect. 
He replaces Gopal Singh, whose term was scheduled to end on May 30.
Responding to a communication from the Ministry, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet on Thursday approved appointment of Kumar as Chairman. 
The decision was conveyed to CIL on Friday. Singh is the Chairman and Managing Director of CIL’s Ranchi-based subsidiary Central Coalfields (CCL). 
He was given additional charge of CIL on September 1, 2017, following superannuation of the last full-time Chairman Sutirtha Bhattacharya in August, 2017. 
Initially, Singh was appointed for six months ending in February 2018.
 The tenure was later extended by three months as the search for a full-time chairman was not over.
It is not known what triggered the removal of Singh. 
But his selection as part-time chairman created controversy as he was part of the panel rejected by the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PSEB) for the CIL top job, in June 2017. “The board did not find any candidate suitable for the post and recommended that the government may choose an appropriate course of further action for selection,” PSEB opined. 
This, however, did not stop Singh and other candidates rejected by PSEB to throw their hat for the top job again. 
There were also unconfirmed reports of Singh being one of the nine candidates short-listed by the Appointments Committee for the CIL top job."
83,2018-05-16,Coal India,"Government allows one-time coal linkage rationalisation for power producers 
 
The government has issued the guidelines to allow power producers to swap coal supply assurances in exchange for lowering tariffs. A Coal Ministry statement said, “The one-time process of calling for the requests of the Independent Power Producers for linkage rationalisation shall be undertaken jointly by Coal India, South Eastern Coalfields and the Central Electricity Authority in a transparent manner.”
Only Independent Power Producers (IPPs) having coal linkages through the allotment route will be eligible to avail of this facility. “The IPPs shall also be stating the Minimum Order Quantity for which the linkage rationalisation shall be requested and their preferred mode of transportation after the linkage rationalisation,” the statement added.
The power producers will have to pass-through the savings achieved due to reduction in the landed price of coal, to the discom and consumers of power. The Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) of the rationalised source from any coal company would be signed and implemented only after the appropriate Electricity Regulatory Commission approves the supplementary agreement. The reduced landed price of coal would lead to savings in cost of power generated and would reduce the transportation cost of coal, the statement added."
82,2018-05-27,Coal India,"Will ensure power plants have 22-day minimum fuel stock: CIL Chairman 


jha




jha




Coal India will ensure that power plants maintain minimum of 22 days fuel as is mandated by the Central Electricity Authority, to avoid future crisis, according to the company Chairman, Anil Kumar Jha. 
Low stocks maintained by the thermal plants for working capital management vis-a-vis sudden spurt in electricity demand had triggered a fuel crisis beginning July last year. Though CIL stepped up supplies to power plants on a war footing, the gap is yet to be bridged. 
In an interview to BusinessLine, Jha said: “Coal stock at power plants is now ruling at 11 days on an average. We are putting our best foot forward to push it to 22 days. And, power plants should henceforth maintain this stock, as it is logistically impossible to serve on demand.”
According to him, logistics is the prime challenge to serving consumers. 
“It is not correct to say there is a crisis of fuel, as we have 45 million tonnes (mt) of idle stock at pithead. The challenge is to reach this fuel to power plants,” he said. 
The company is now busy exploring transportation options to liquidate the stock. 
Jha, who was appointed for the top job on May 18, is hopeful that the demand-supply gap would be breached soon as CIL supplies are up 13 per cent so far this year and the monsoon is round the corner. 
According to the company, a 27-per cent drop in hydroelectric supplies is creating additional demand for fuel.
The scene is expected to get more comfortable on the coal supply front this year as the CIL-financed 53.5-km Jharsuguda-Barapali rail link was recently operationalised, connecting the resource rich Ib-valley reserves in Sundergarh district of Odisha. “We are now evacuating approximately two rake (of about 4,000 tonnes each) loads of fuel through this line. Once the rail operations are stabilised on this route, we can evacuate 4-5 rakes a day,” he said.
CIL has already opened a 13-mt mine in the area and capacity of another mine is escalated by four mt.
MCL production
Jha, who was Chairman of the Odisha-based mining subsidiary Mahanadi Coalfields (MCL), expects MCL’s production to increase by 19 mt (over 13 per cent) this year, contributing significantly to the plan to step up CIL’s total production from 567 mt in 2017-18 to 652 mt in 2018-19.
MCL is not alone. The recently opened rail-road connectivity to the prolific Magadh coalfield in Jharkhand is also expected to contribute in stepping up supplies significantly."

Coal India Ltd (CIL) will develop its first-ever thermal power plant in the country in Odisha, a top company official said here on Monday.
The project will be implemented through CIL’s subsidiary, Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL).
The power plant, which will have a capex of ₹13,000 crore and a capacity of 1,600 MW (2x800 MW ), will come up at Sundergarh district. Power producer NTPC Ltd will be a joint venture partner and will likely have a 49 per cent stake.
The project has been able to get land and coal linkages and will utilise the pithead stock. NTPC will use existing power purchase agreements for the project.
According to CIL’s Chairman and Managing Director Anil Kumar Jha, a second super-critical power plant may also be set up by Central Coalfields Ltd, another subsidiary of the coal behemoth. The power plant, whose capacity is yet to be decided, will come up at North Karanpura area in Bokaro district of Jharkhand. NTPC and Power Finance Consultancy Ltd are the likely JV partners for the project.
“All formalities and clearances for the Sundergarh power project are in place. We have tied up with NTPC to run the plant. The North Karanpura project is at the consultancy level,” Jha said.
He said CILhas budgeted for a capex of ₹9,500 crore for FY19. However, with the Sundergarh project under way, the capex may go up by an additional ₹1,500 crore."

According to a release by the company, 47 rakes per day were also loaded through washery circuit and Railways goods-shed siding which further helped in augmenting supplies to the power sector. Besides enhancing dispatches through rail, the power stations that are located within a 50-60 km vicinity of the mines and have a FSA are being offered coal through road and rail-cum-road mode. CIL has requested the Union Power Ministry to persuade power stations situated within 20 km of the mine to lift their entire requirement by road.

77,2018-06-09,Coal India,"CIL refutes Nabha Power allegation of coal shortage 
 The claim of the Nabha Power to shut down its 750 MW plant at Rajapura in Punjab due to inability of Coal India to offer coal is not true, a CIL official said today.
The L&T group firm Nabha Power closed its Rajapura plant on June 3 stating that it was forced to take the decision due to shortage of coal supplied by the CIL.
The CIL official said the Nabha Power should gear up lifting the allotted coal and rush it to its plant instead of blaming coal crisis for the shutdown of the plant.
The alleged crisis at the Nabha Power is the result of its own inept handling of coal procurement plans, as booking and lifting of additional coal allocated by CIL for the peak summer/paddy season was inordinately delayed, he said.
Nevertheless, the CIL and the Railways have attached priority for movement of coal to the power stations of Punjab, particularly to the Nabha Power. As on June 8, as many as 27 rakes of coal are in transit for the Nabha Power plant, he said.
Coal for this plant is linked to the SECL and normally supplies are in the level of 75 per cent of contracted quantity due to logistic problems.
But, it is a regular practice to meet coal requirement during summer and paddy seasons from other subsidiaries of the CIL, he said.
During the current fiscal, at the request of the Nabha Power, the CIL had allocated 3.64 lakh tonnes of coal to be lifted from the CCL and the BCCL for the period Apr18 to Jun18.
Out of this allocation, the Nabha Power has so far booked only 1.54 lakh tonnes. Due to delayed logistic arrangement of the Nabha Power, the lifting is paltry at 0.25 lakh tonnes, he said.
The shutdown has added to the woes of the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), which is already short of 1,400 mw of power due to permanent closure of four units of the Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant Bathinda and two units of the Ropar thermal plant, along with a reduction in the transfer capacity from the northern grid.
The CIL wondered how despite having a total generation capacity of 6540 mw in the state, Punjab is staring at the prospect of power shortage in the crucial summer and paddy sowing season."
76,2018-07-02,Coal India,"CIL posts 15% production growth in Q1

According to a release, the company produced 136.87 million tonnes (mt) during the April-June period, an 18.03-mt increase over the 118.84-mt produced during the same quarter last year.
On the offtake side, a higher rake loading saw a 16.01 mt increase to 153.43 mt for Q1 FY19.
Overall rake loading increased to 238.8 rakes per day during the Q1 FY19 against 218.9 rakes during the same quarter last fiscal.
Meanwhile, CIL has also improved supplies to power sector with a growth of 15.4 per cent during the first quarter of the fiscal at 122.84 mt. 
The number of power stations having critical stock has come down from 30 at the beginning of the fiscal to 16 as of June 2018. Of the overall coal supplies of the company during Q1, supplies to the power sector accounted for 80 per cent and a request has been made to TPPs to perk up their coal stocks, the world’s largest miner said in a release. 
The quarter also saw rake loading to the power sector increase by 15 per cent, on a YoY basis, to 217 rakes per day. Rake loading during the corresponding period last fiscal stood at 189.9 rakes per day.
The company liquidated 16.56 mt of pithead coal stock during the first three months of the current fiscal to step up supplies."

Due to severe congestion, evacuating more than 17-20 rakes of coal a day is a challenge for NCL




Due to severe congestion, evacuating more than 17-20 rakes of coal a day is a challenge for NCL


For Singrauli-based Northern Coalfields Ltd (NCL), a mining subsidiary of state-owned Coal India, 2018-19 is a landmark year, as its coal production is expected to breach the 100 million tonne (mt) mark, from 93 mt in 2017-18.
Only two out of seven mining subsidiaries — Sambalpur-based Mahanadi Coalfields and Bilaspur-based South Eastern Coalfields — have touched this milestone so far.
NCL reported a 16 per cent production growth to 24.6 mt in the June quarter. The run-rate is expected to rise in the second half of the year. “We are confident of touching the 100 mt production this year,” said NCL Chairman PK Sinha.
Stock piling at pithead
What goes unsaid is approximately half the additional 7 mt production will be dumped at the pithead, as is evident from the projected increase in offtake (supplies), from 96.77 mt to 100.5 mt.
The trend would have been evident in the first quarter itself had the pithead power stations run by the Central government-owned NTPC (9,620 MW) and Uttar Pradesh State genco UPRVUNL (3,873 MW) not come to NCL’s rescue by building up stocks at the factory end.
According to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), as on July 16, two out of three NTPC stations, all connected by merry-go-round rail, have 27 days days’ stock of fuel. One has 14 days’ stock. The Obra thermal power station of RVUNL has 32 days’ stock, way above the CEA prescribed limit of 21 days. Normally, power plants are against high stock building as they cannot recover the finance cost from tariff. And, Lanco’s Anpara (1,200 MW) facility stuck to the rule, maintaining five days’ stock, which is comfortable for any pithead facility.
Infrastructure inadequacy
Meanwhile, NCL’s customers located far away from the pithead — three power stations in Haryana, two in Rajasthan (Kota and Suratgarh) and two in UP (Prayagraj and Parichha) — are fuel-starved.
The Haryana thermal facilities have five days’ coal each. Prayagraj has two days’ stock and Suratgarh four days’ stock.
The blame shouldn’t go to NCL. This composite coalfield, characterised by 10 contiguous coal mines in a 312 sq km area, was created in the 1970s to serve pithead stations. Successive governments in Delhi have failed to provide even the basic transport infrastructure to Singrauli.
Located at the UP-Madhya Pradesh border, the region is linked by an unelectrified single-track rail. Leave alone coal movement, even passenger movement is a challenge here. “In the days of the Raj, this area was known as kalapani, it still is devoid of connectivity,” said an NCL official.
There is one train to Kolkata everyday. The intercity train to Varanasi, the nearest town, takes eight hours on an average to cover 200 km. The rest of the trains are weekly. The nearest airport is a five-hour gruelling road journey away, at Varanasi.
Track doubling, a boon
“NCL is located closer to the consumption centres in northern and western India. But the evacuation infrastructure has been a problem so far,” said Sinha. Due to severe congestion, sending more than 17-20 rakes of coal a day is a challenge for him.
Sinha, however, promises that the problems will be addressed in two years, once the double tracking of lines connecting Singrauli is complete.
In 2016 the Union Cabinet had undertaken a mammoth programme to double the track capacity on the 261-km Katni-Singrauli route and 160-km Singrauli-Ramna route at a combined cost of ₹4,761 crore, primarily to ensure coal evacuation from NCL. Both the projects were scheduled to be over in 2020.
As an interim arrangement, the Railways recently opened six good sheds in a 50-km radius to help NCL evacuate fuel for upcountry consumers through the rail-cum-road mode. NCL is also investing in rail links to mines and coal handling facilities to ensure faster evacuation.
“For future growth we have to look at upcountry customers,” Sinha said."

AK Jha, Chairman and MD




AK Jha, Chairman and MD


Over the decades, Coal India often reported double-digit growth in production, but coal availability remained an issue due to rail logistics constrains. The problem is now set to be mitigated, courtesy the Centre’s push on infrastructure.
Anil Kumar Jha, Chairman and Managing Director of Coal India Ltd, said coal supplies should start moving at great speed beginning this year as a number of key projects are reaching the final stage of completion.
“The isolation of some vast coal reserves in Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh is to end soon. There will be a quantum jump in coal evacuation logistics in two years,” Jha said in his first interview since taking over on May 18.
Supply boost
CIL has taken an “aspirational target” to increase coal despatches from 580 million tonnes to 681 mt this fiscal. The production target has been set at 85 mt higher than last year’s 567 mt. Comparatively, CIL increased its production by 104 mt, and its off-take or supplies grew by 109 mt, over the last four years.
Jha reckons the target is steep, but doable if the monsoon doesn’t get extended or the rainfall doesn’t exceed normal limits, and if the law and order situation in the Odisha coalfields improves even slightly. Frequent strikes, especially in and around the prolific Talcher coalfields, in Odisha, cause major production losses.
Jha is confident about meeting the target this fiscal. “I am very sure we will land up somewhere near the FY18 target both on production and despatch; this will help mitigate the supply shortfall once and for all,” he said.
According to him, the Bilaspur-based South Eastern Coalfields and the Sambalpur-based Mahanadi Coalfields will contribute half of the production growth; the Ranchi-based Central Coalfields (CCL) and the Singrauli-based Northern Coalfields (NCL), will also contribute significantly..
The recently completed 53-km Jharsuguda-Barapali rail-link connecting Ib-Valley reserves in Sundargarh district of Odisha will play a crucial rule in enhancing supplies. The 45-km Tori-Shivpur line, which will facilitate coal transportation from large Magadh and Amrapali reserves by rail and road, will be completed by December. In Chattishgarh, the 90-km Kharsia-Dharamjaygarh link will also be partly operational in December, Jha said. 
However, CIL’s profit after tax fell nearly 40 per cent since March 2014, partly owing to the increased focus on the power sector, which pays 20 per cent less than other consumers for low-quality thermal coal.
Jha, however, hinted that 2018-19 should see profitability improve as the provisioning for wage increases were over in the last fiscal. CIL saw nearly ₹10,000 crore outgo in FY18. This includes ₹2,700 crore arrears to officers, ₹7,400 crore provisioning for gratuity and other benefits to non-executive employees on account of a ₹800 crore hike in wages. “The financial performance should improve in FY19,” he said. 
Power JV 
Meanwhile, CIL is expected to firm up a joint venture with NTPC for pithead power generation this fiscal. On behalf of CIL, its mining subsidiary MCL will participate in the JV to set up a 2X800 MW facility at Sundergarh in Odisha.
The preliminary work is through. The project got coal linkage (in-principle fuel supply assurance), environment and forest clearance proposals and in advanced stages (of approval). We have written to NTPC for participation and hopeful to finalise the JV this fiscal,” he said. He is a part-time chairman in MCL."

Underground mines in India are required to acquire the overhead surface area, which makes them all the more unviable
   -  THE HINDU




Underground mines in India are required to acquire the overhead surface area, which makes them all the more unviable
   -  THE HINDU


Shatrughan Sinha and Amitabh Bachchan toiling in the dark caverns of a deep coal mine in the 1979 hit Kala Patthar has more or less come to represent life in the Indian coal industry.
The image now needs a makeover, as underground (UG) mining, once the mainstay and a relatively environment-friendly option, has become rare in India.
In FY18, the nation’s two commercial miners — Coal India Ltd (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Co Ltd (SCCL) — produced 629 million tonne of fuel. Of this, barely 39 mt, or 6 per cent, came from underground sources, down from 16 per cent in FY05 and nearly 9 per cent in FY14. Among the top coal-producing nations, only Indonesia has a lower UG share. Considering 25 per cent of India’s coal assets are deep-seated, UG should ideally contribute a quarter of production.
Dramatic decline in CIL
The decline is more prominent in CIL, which contributes 90 per cent of India’s commercial production. Last fiscal, a little over 5 per cent of CIL’s total production (567 mt) came from UG, down from 11.5 per cent in FY08 and 7.8 per cent in FY14.
Barring South Eastern Coalfields, no major CIL subsidiary has respectable UG production. Some, like Northern Coalfields, have no UG mines.
This is both due to a rise in opencast production and a sharp decline in underground production, from as high as 70 mt (90 per cent of total production) in 1975, when CIL was created through nationalisation, to 30 mt in FY18. The trend is not new and is partly attributed to improvement in opencast technologies, allowing the company to convert assets up to 250 metres deep into opencast mines. In comparison, technology absorption was low in UG.
But that alone doesn’t explain the dramatic fall in UG share over the past decade. In the first 30 years following nationalisation, UG production dropped by 23 mt. The rate of decline has doubled since 2005, as CIL lost 17 mt UG production in 13 years.
One of the reasons behind the sharp drop in production is the closure of unviable UG mines acquired during nationalisation.
The production trend could have been reversed by opening new mines or introducing mechanisation in existing mines, which didn’t happen due to lack of commercial interest.
Coal prices are practically government-dictated in India. And the government is focussed on keeping fuel prices low for the power sector, which consumes at least 80 per cent of CIL’s production. Naturally, producing thermal coal through the underground mode becomes unviable.
Also, unlike in countries such as Australia, UG mines in India are required to acquire the overhead surface area. This make them all the more unviable.
The biggest deterrent, however, is the government. Since 2005, India has been on a massive thermal power capacity addition programme. Between 2007 and 2017, its total generation capacity increased by 1.5 times.
The period also coincided with major controversies and policy faux pas in the coal sector. As a face-saver, the government put pressure on CIL to step up production quickly. CIL obliged.
Since FY07, India’s coal production has increased by 200 mt; nearly half of it came in the past four years, and opencast was the easiest way to do it. Roughly 3,000 hectare of India’s mountains and forests are plundered every year for opencast mines while the UG version slips into oblivion.
The last time CIL made media statements about opening new UG mines was in 2009, when half-a-dozen high capacity (3-5 mt) projects were lined up. None saw the light of day.
A ray of hope
A number of former senior executives believe CIL’s opencast share has reached environmentally unsustainable levels and a correction is necessary. SCCL’s 2-mt Adriala project shows there are economic reasons, too. The UG mine taps reserves located below an opencast project. There are similar resources in CIL, too.
A CIL official told BusinessLine the declining trend in UG production may be arrested this year. The company is planning to introduce continuous miners in 10 more mines this year, to step up productivity."

Two public-sector undertakings -- BEML Ltd and Heavy Engineering Corporation Ltd (HEC) -- have signed an MoU to meet the growing requirement of the mining sector. Both the companies have synergies in their product profiles and are to manufacture and supply products such as rope shovels and walking draglines for the mining industry.
The joint effort would help the country attain ‘self-reliance’ in such equipment, saving foreign exchange. Further, it will also help counter the competition from MNCs and resist further entry of other global players for the supply of rope shovels and walking draglines.
BEML-HEC is also exploring the possibility of getting funding from the Department of Heavy Industries (DHI) for developmental projects such as the ‘Development of 20CuM Rope Shovel’.
The MoU was signed in the presence of Anil Kumar Jha, Chairman and Managing Director, Coal India Ltd (CIL), a customer of both BEML and HEC. Signing the MoU, Deepak Kumar Hota, CMD, BEML Ltd, said, “Considering the huge business prospects in the mining industry, especially in CIL, this is an opportunity to collaborate and synergise the strengths of both the organisations, to produce products for the sector and effectively utilise installed facilities. This will also help us in utilising the existing SME eco-system. Since BEML is located close to Tamil Nadu, the MoU will benefit the MSME enterprises.”
Avijit Ghosh, CMD, Heavy Engineering Corporation, said, “The MoU will prove to be a landmark in joint collaboration between two public sector industries for the mining industry and the country. During the CPSE conclave, the Prime Minister urged the PSUs to work together and nurture each other’s strengths. This is a step in that direction.”"

Coal miners gain from contract labour
Four decades after nationalisation, 3.36 lakh workers in state-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) are a happy lot. At CIL, which contributes 90 per cent of commercial coal production in the country, workers earn ₹30,000 to ₹1 lakh a month, excluding bonus, medical and statutory benefits, depending on skill levels.
Not only are the workers benfitting, coal companies, which were once sick, are now making hefty profits. Production has increased by nearly 220 million tonnes in the last 10 years. The government, on its part, is minting money through taxes and dividend. Coal is the single largest revenue churner for the railways. And, consumers benefit from the supply of low-priced coal for domestic use.
These gains are, however, being made at the expense of one segment — the 39,000 contract workers who account for around 11 per cent of the combined workforce of CIL and SCCL. They contributed to two-thirds (398 million tonnes) of the commercial coal production (629 mt) in 2017-18, but are paid a measly ₹15,000-20,000 per month.
An exploited lot
Employed by contractors, who are basically goons backed by local politicians, the workers are paid a fraction of what their counterparts in CIL get. They live in tin-roofed dormitories in most unhealthy conditions and suffer from a disproportionately high rate of injuries and fatalities in mine accidents.
According to the preliminary findings of an ongoing study — parts of which were discussed at a mine safety conference recently — by the Directorate General of Mine Safety (DGMS), the rate of accidents in the case of the contractor worker was 2.7 times more than the regular worker during 2010-16. The trend is likely to worsen as mining firms are seeing outsourcing as a more productive option than depending on their lethargic workforce, whose productivity is one of the lowest in the world.
In 2005, the country’s coal sector, including Tamil Nadu-based Neyveli Lignite (NLC), had only 15,000 contract workers. In 2017, the number moved up to 58,000. All mines put together, the number of contract workers is a sizeable 1.08 lakh as against 4.55 lakh regular workers.
From a commercial perspective, the emphasis on contractual mining is paying off.
In 2010-11, CIL produced 431 mt of fuel. Roughly 50 per cent of the production, or 215 mt, was outsourced. In 2017-18, 345 mt, or 61 per cent of the 567 mt produced, was outsourced. It means much of the 136 mt growth in production during the last seven years came from contract labour.
Also, 74 per cent of the 1,172 cubic metre overburden (spoil or waste) removal in 2017-18 was outsourced. Now, one begins to wonder what CIL’s mammoth workforce is doing. 
Moreover, with the cost of extraction being one-third of CIL’s, contractors are generating huge savings for the company. 
These are distributed in the form of 20-25 per cent wage increases for regular workers every five years and dividend to shareholders. The best part is, all this is happening without much increase in fuel price. Naturally, the government is pushing for the contract mining or MDO (mine developer and operator) model.
MDO is not wrong
Theoretically, there is nothing wrong in contract mining. It is evident that private miners are way more productive (in tonne per man basis) than CIL’s own workers. 
The country could have benefited if contract workers had more handle to the production. 
What’s wrong is, contractual workers are being exploited in the process. The government has so far only notified the minimum salaries of contract workers and that coal companies pay such salaries through direct bank transfer, and nothing more.
The reason behind this policy inaction is purely political. Labour and transport contracts for any project across the country are considered the preserve of the local population . In coal mines, it has taken the shape of a nexus.
With 95 per cent of CIL’s production coming from opencast mines, land is in constant demand. On an average, the company needs 2,000-3,000 hectares of land every year to keep the electricity flowing through the wires. And, a 2013 legislation made such acquisitions awfully difficult.
This hurdle though, has been overcome by a known formula: Allow the project affected to grab contracts. Which means, even if CIL appoints the world’s finest miner as MDO, it has to sublet contracts to the locals. This is also the reason why reputed global miners keep away from CIL tenders for contract mining. And, when voters agree can politics be far behind? At coalfields, politicians are a part of this nexus. Most of the dump trucks seen plying in mining areas are owned by ‘netas’, cutting across party lines.
The practice, which was initiated soon after nationalisation, has gained momentum as coal production is being fast-tracked.
Disastrous consequences
The outcome is disastrous, to say the least. Modern-day mining became safer with the introduction of high-capacity machines and vehicles that reduce congestion on mine roads as also the chance of accidents.
CIL, which operates some of the world’s largest opencast mines, is a glaring exception to this rule. As village contractors cannot afford costly machines, each worth a few hundred crores of rupees, they settle for cheaper low-tonne equipment making safety a casualty.
A DGMS study points out that the use of low-capacity equipment by contractors, whose lack of technical knowledge mainly due to poor or no training, as a prime reason for the high rate of fatalities among contract workers. Since these workers are mostly outsiders and small in number, such accidents do not carry any political significance locally.
And, as long as votes are intact and production doesn’t stop, who cares for a few thousand contract workers spread across eight or nine large States? 
Yes, the coal companies are stigmatised. But, should a CIL or SCCL come forward and announce at least equal pay to both contract and regular workers? Will the government allow them to hike coal prices to cover up the additional outgo, spare them for the drop in profits and share price and, demand less dividend?"

Strategy: Traders can consider a bull-call spread on Coal India by buying ₹285-call and simultaneously selling the ₹300-call. They closed with a premium of ₹9.30 and ₹3.80, respectively. That means, traders need to pay ₹5.5 a contract (or ₹12,100), which would be the maximum loss. If Coal India fails to move up from the current levels, it will be a loss.

 Coal India Ltd (CIL) will close down 53 of its 174 underground (UG) mines this fiscal, shutting those that are either economically unviable or pose safety issues. The company had shut 43 such mines in the last fiscal.
The company has a total of 369 mines, including 177 open-cast, 18 mixed and 174 UG. The production from UG mines has slid consistently, and in 2017-18, stood at 30 million tonnes, or five per cent of CIL’s total production.
CIL Chairman Anil Kumar Jha said the miner had appointed the Indian School of Mines (ISM) to study the rationalisation of its underground mines.
“We inherited around 700 underground mines at the time of nationalisation. Now we are trying to rationalise mines that are very small and are not financially viable,” Jha told newspersons after the company’s annual general meeting here on Wednesday.
As a part of the rationalisation exercise, CIL would consider amalgamating 3-4 mines into a larger outfit or convert them into open-cast mines wherever possible, apart from closing down those that are ‘highly unproductive’, financially unviable and also pose ‘safety concerns’. 
The company would wait for ISM’s suggestions before proceeding further. “We expect them to give us the report within the next six months,” Jha said.
CIL is looking to achieve an ‘aspirational’ production target of 652 million tonne (mt) in 2018-19, a 15 per cent rise over 567.36 mt registered in FY18. 
Coal supply to the power sector is estimated to be close to 525 mt this fiscal, nearly 16 per cent higher than 454 mt in FY18. 
Talking about stepping up its growth rate to meet production targets, Jha said four coal mining projects with an ultimate capacity of 24.6 mt a year, and entailing an investment of ₹4,155 crore had been approved by the CIL board. 
“A total of 11 coal blocks have been allotted to Eastern Coalfields, Bharat Coking Coal and Western Coalfields put together. These new blocks will help these subsidiaries produce more than 100 mt of coal per annum in the near future,” he said."

Miscommunication reigns
On the issue of closing down Coal India’s Delhi office, the Coal Minister and Coal Secretary were not on the same page. The new Coal Secretary was quick to brush aside the question saying that there was no such proposal. Coal Minister Piyush Goyal when confronted with the action taken report on his proposal said that this was very much on the cards, adding that not just Delhi, even other CIL offices in metros must be shut down. He said this with the Coal Secretary standing beside him.
Policy deadlock
With the proposed e-commerce policy being sent to a panel of secretaries, which has been tasked with ironing out the contentious issues, some people involved in the drafting of the document are disappointed. Officials say that with no deadline for resolving the issue and finalising the draft, Indian negotiators will have to continue holding talks on e-commerce at various bilateral and regional forums and also at the World Trade Organisation without a sound domestic policy guiding them. Now that the panel of secretaries, which met last week, has decided to meet next in October, the policy may not be in place anytime soon.
Rural housing boost
The Centre is “dead serious” about giving rural housing push, as part of its “Housing for All” by 2022 goal. So much so that the interim Managing Director and CEO of National Housing Bank Dakshita Das (Additional Secretary in the Finance Ministry) herself chaired a meeting of CEOs of the top 15 housing finance companies in the country last week. When quizzed about the deliberations of the closed door meeting, a chief executive merely said that the new NHB Chief had in national interest given some “guidance” to the companies for providing a push to rural housing. The CEO also quipped that such guidance should be seen as “directives” for the sector given that all housing finance companies are licensed with the NHB. Can’t agree with him more.
Smart approach
The Finance Ministry mandarins are now taking a smart approach in dealing with the broking community’s demand for cuts in securities transaction tax (STT)/Commodities Transaction Tax (CTT). This came to the fore at a recent capital market summit in the Capital. A senior Finance Ministry official admitted that STT/CTT rates in India are higher than those prevailing internationally. 
This official said that over a period of time transaction charges such as STT/CTT in India will have to come down, but in the same vein also remarked that the transaction charges levied by exchanges should also be reduced! Fair point, but the bourses may not relish this as it would eat into their revenues. 
Promoter’s call
Rarely does Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan cancel his programme. So when 48 hours before the maiden open acreage auction OALP-1 contracts were to be signed on September 6, a communication from the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons stated that it had been postponed without citing any reasons. No new dates were communicated. 
Though the official word is yet to come out, whispers are that the new date is September 24. 
There is speculation about the real reason and some say the contract signing was put off on Vedanta’s behest. 
Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd won 41 out of the 55 oil and gas exploration blocks offered in OALP-1, and needed its shareholders nod. This issue cropped up because initially the team was looking for 20 bids only, but later on the promoters wanted to go for all, those in the know said.

Coal India (Buy)
CMP: ₹278.75
Target: ₹365
Coal India is a public sector holding company. Coal India is a coal mining company, which is engaged in the production and sale of coal.
We reiterate ‘Buy’ on Coal India (CIL) with revised target price of ₹365 as we expect re-rating with market finally appreciating the structural improvements such as improved coal quality, better evacuation, significant increase in auction linked volumes and sharp reduction in working capital which provide strong earnings/cash flow visibility. 
We also expect strong upside to e-auction realisations given the strong global coal prices, weak rupee and strong underlying demand (from both power and non-power) which is expected to mitigate the headwind of higher diesel prices.
Concerns around divestment capping stock returns in near term are overdone as CIL trades at inexpensive valuations of 5.4x FY19E EV/EBITDA despite attractive return ratios and robust dividend yield."

Partha Sarathi Bhattacharyya




It is quite the norm in India to bash public sector enterprises for their lack of drive, vision and imaginative leadership, while showering private sector firms with accolades for these very same qualities. But the recent skeletons tumbling out of the closets of loan defaulters, banks and project financiers from India’s private sector tell us that this perception is both stereotypical and flawed.
Role models for visionary leadership exist as much in India’s entrenched public sector enterprises, as in its Nifty 50 firms. If private sector top honchos make it to more magazine covers and have more paeans sung to them in corporate hagiographies, that’s probably because they are better at commissioning glossy coffee table books to trumpet their achievements.
It is for this reason that the business biography of Coal India, When Coal Turned Gold, one of India’s most valuable public sector undertakings (PSUs), written by its former Chairman Partha Sarathi Bhattacharyya, deserves to be read.
This is a very detailed and technical book, not designed for coffee tables by any stretch of imagination, that tells the story of India’s coal sector through the eyes of a career public sector professional.
Joining Coal India as a management trainee in Finance in 1977, Bhattacharyya worked his way up its ranks to retire as its Chairman in 2011. He is thus able to offer an insider’s account of what it takes to turn around a loss-making PSU riddled with operational problems, take on its militant unions and burnish its public image to an extent where it managed a blockbuster listing on the bourses.
The author hasn’t tried to gloss over the cultural and governance problems that beset an unwieldy behemoth like Coal India. Anecdotes in the book shine light on the minefield that an ambitious PSU executive needs to navigate if he’s keen to get things moving.
First, there’s the constant tug-of-war between commercial sense, and pressure from the government to fulfil social objectives. While the prices charged by Coal India to its customers were supposed to be ‘deregulated’ from January 2000, in practise it was never allowed to revise its prices in keeping with market trends.
The unwritten rule was that prices could be only be raised to cover wage cost escalations negotiated with trade unions, once in a blue moon.
Coal India thus had to resort to a variety of machinations to gain even the bare minimum pricing power essential to sustain a profit.
Weeding out deep-rooted corruption in both procurement and the award of contracts often meant going head-to-head with political bosses and fighting in-house vested interests.
The book recounts may incidents where the author used unconventional means — from co-opting the local media to buttonholing ministers in airports — to overcome such hurdles.
Then, there’s the Sword of Damocles of ‘vigilance’. There’s the story of a Coal India subsidiary facing major production deficits owing to a severe shortage of off-the-road tyres for its mining equipment.
Though its losses were widening by the day and it received an unsolicited offer from a global tyre major for a five-year supply contract, its top brass was petrified of signing the deal for the fear of vigilance queries.
The deadlock was eventually broken by running the deal by the CVC in advance.
Though the book is autobiographical, Bhattacharyya manages to give a matter-of-fact account of the problems he encountered and resolved, without self-aggrandisement.
He also makes no effort to sweep under the carpet the more unsavoury aspects of the company he oversaw and admits to his feelings of helplessness at times.
One such poignant chapter is on fatal accidents caused by roof falls, inundations and gas explosions in the mining chambers. The author laments that though Coal India managed to significantly reduce accidents through global benchmarking, fatalities remained a fact of life. In such cases, the company would usually provide employment to the next of kin.
But he remained deeply dissatisfied by this arrangement and says: “The fact that the victim had laid down his life while trying to provide energy security to the nation and was therefore a martyr, was largely unrecognised….and the loss of income from the entry-level job offered to the next-of-kin was substantial”.
To remedy this, Coal India initiated a lumpsum compensation for the bereaved and inaugurated a Martyr’s Memorial at Koylanagar to record for posterity the sacrifices made by workers in this hazardous industry.
One of the more interesting chapters in this book describes Coal India’s bridal makeover for its public market listing.
Bhattacharyya talks of how he began to prepare the ground for the IPO at least three years before the fact. He reached out to foreign institutional investors on every foreign trip for feedback on how they perceived Coal India.
After gathering that it had quite a black reputation in the investing community — it was perceived as a company that denuded large tracts of land, had abysmally low productivity and was corrupt — he went about systematically addressing these pain points.
Coal India’s fifty largest open-cast mines were chosen for time-bound land reclamation programmes. They were geo-tagged to verify compliance and obtain ISO 14001 certifications.
Stiff resistance from the trade unions to the disinvestment had to be overcome too, and Bhattacharyya managed this by convincing the employees to participate in the IPO.
In the home run to the IPO, Coal India drummed up positive media coverage by declaring a special dividend of ₹2,200 crore and getting the Prime Minister to accept the cheque.
Given the scant preparation with which PSU offers seem to hit the markets nowadays, requiring bailouts by the LIC, one hopes the Centre’s disinvestment managers are reading this book.
On the flip side, the book is a dry read, as it is written from a technocrat’s perspective, with very few human or humorous touches that one finds in more slickly produced corporate biographies.
The author’s tendency to launch into the nitty-gritties of how he de-tangled knotty financial or operational issues relating to tenders, pricing, wage negotiations et al, may only interest practising managers of PSUs, industrial firms, and mining professionals.
But it is a definite inspiration for ambitious managers in public sector enterprises or in the civil services, when things look black for their career.

Partha Sarathi Bhattacharyya joined Coal India Ltd as a management trainee in 1977 and ultimately went on to become its chairman and managing director in 2006. He engineered the country’s largest ever IPO, a ₹15,000-crore offer, which was subscribed over twelve times."

The Centre had on Tuesday cancelled the appointment of A K Singh as the Chairman of Bharat Coking Coal. He had returned to his previous post as Eastern Coalfields' General Manager.
Singh was a few months short of completing a full year as CMD of the Dhanbad-based BCCL. In its notice, the Ministry has cited lack of approval as the reason behind his removal.
According to sources, there were complaints against Singh. However, the nature of complaints is not known. BCCL is a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd.
Meanwhile the Union Coal Minister also appointed joint secretary level officers in the ministry as nodal officers for the seven mining subsidiaries of CIL. 
According to a senior CIL official, the nodal officers will be responsible for helping subsidiary management to resolve issues with the ministry, if any."
56,2018-10-19,Coal India,"Govt decides to increase tenure of FSAs with steel industry 
 Coal India has decided to increase the tenure of fuel supply pacts to be signed with the steel industry to 10 years with a view to reducing the sector’s reliance on imports for the fuel, according to a notice.
 The new FSA tenure would be applicable from the fourth tranche of auction of coking coal linkages for the steel sector to be held shortly, Coal India said in a notice to its subsidiaries.
 “In view of substantial investment required for setting up of coal washing capacity by the consumer and with the aim to reduce dependence of steel sector on imported coal further, the tenure of steel sector linkage auction FSAs (fuel supply agreements) has now been increased to 10 years, which would be mutually extendable by another five years,” Coal India Ltd (CIL) said in the notice.
 The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had earlier approved allocation of coal linkages for non-regulated sector only through auction.
 Sectors included for the auction are cement, steel/sponge iron, aluminium, and others (excluding fertiliser, urea), the government had said.
 Prior to auctions, the Standing Linkage Committee had been deciding on allocation of long-term and short-term linkages for the sectors, including power and steel."
55,2018-10-22,Coal India,"CIL offers 5 mt coal to NTPC to reduce pithead stock 
Coal India Ltd has offered an additional five million tonnes of coal to the country’s largest power generator, NTPC, with tweaked terms to reduce the pithead stock.
According to Coal India officials, the company has offered five mt of coal to NTPC which needs to be lifted via road to reduce import. Coal is normally transported by rakes as per fuel supply agreement.
The Coal Ministry had pulled up Coal India and wanted the miner to dilute its pithead stock by 10 mt from about 21 mt as of September to push supplies in the festive season.
The officials said that against the normal supply term of cash and carry, the release of five mt against this offer shall be made on a credit basis without insisting on any advance payment. NTPC would make the payment after receipt of invoices.
CIL has asked NTPC to immediately contact its subsidiaries to avail themselves of the benefit of the offer and to lift the coal within 30 days of release, the officials added."
54,2018-10-23,Coal India,"CIL: Higher coal production will improve supply
State-owned Coal India Ltd is expecting some let up in the fuel shortage crisis in power plants by the first week of November.
The relief will be through additional allotment of 60 lakh tonnes coal to pithead power stations, by diluting pit-head stock, and a ramp up of daily production to 18 lakh tonnes from 16 lt.
A proportion this coal is stuck in remote mines and the power plants will have to lift the stocks by rail or road.
According to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), 22 non-pithead power stations had less than four days’ fuel stock on October 22. Among the pithead stations, a large number of Central government-owned NTPC power plants had a maximum of two days’ stock. The fuel shortage is reflected in the volatility in spot electricity tariff. Round-the-clock average tariff at IEX was ₹6.92/kWh on Tuesday.
Though Coal India (CIL) reported 10.6 per cent increase in supplies during April-September period, the average supply dropped from 16 lt per day to 13 lt between July and September. It didn’t impact the electricity supply due to the availability of hydro-electricity.
The coal supplies improved late in October to 16.5 lt per day but the electricity demand also rose. Also, hydel and renewable energy supplies tapered down, escalating the demand for coal.
NTPC plants ran dry faster as they worked overtime since the middle of this year when the Centre decided to feed the pithead stations on priority basis to ride over the rail infrastructure inadequacies and ensure availability of electricity.
The ministry wants to serve units located in 500-600 km range to improve the turnaround of rakes.
As a solution CIL now offers NTPC additional 50 lt fuel (diluting the mine end stock of 210 lt) from all six subsidiaries to build stock at plant-end over the next 30 days. According to a senior company official, IPPs are also offered to lift 10 lt stock from large Dipka and Gevra mines in Chhattisgarh.
“We have invited NTPC to lift 15 lt from Amrapali and Magadh coal mines of Central Coalfields (Ranchi), 5 lt each from BCCL (Dhanbad) and NCL(Singrauli). At CCL we offered them to operate two sidings exclusively. They can also use our sidings. Payment conditions are relaxed to ease supply. They can carry coal to wherever they want,” the official said.
But the worry is that CIL barely has two weeks’ pithead stock. The official said production will be stepped up to 18 lt a day from November 1. NTPC seems to have started preparing for short term tenders to lift the coal on “as is where is basis”. The company supplies power to discoms on cost-plus basis. So the additional cost will be recovered through tariff.
However, the IPPs are yet to respond to this scheme as they operate on fixed tariff power purchase agreements and Discoms resisting cost increase. “This is a voluntary scheme, and would involve extra cost on logistics, which means we have to take prior approval of the regulator for cost recovery,” a source in a private power company told BusinessLine.
The regulator keeps dragging its feet on such proposals, he said."

Methane gas plant (file photo) - By Special Arrangement


 The Coal Ministry has identified 11 mines to produce coal bed methane (CMB). Of these, 10 will be worked on jointly by ONGC and Coal India Ltd (CIL), and the two will also work on one mine with SAIL. 
“It was decided in a meeting last week that ONGC and CIL will partner to produce CBM from 10 new mines that Coal India will open. Initially, ONGC will harness the gas and then CIL will extract coal from them…the first agreement for harnessing CBM through this route is expected to be signed as early as next month,” a Coal Ministry official told BusinessLine.
“In addition to the mines with CIL, the two (ONGC and CIL) will also help develop Steel Authority of India Limited’s Parbatpur coal block. Here, too, ONGC will first harness the CBM,” the official said.
“SAIL had surrendered the Sitanala and Parbatpur coal mines this year. We levied a penalty on SAIL for not making progress on the Sitanala coal mine. But we told SAIL to keep the Parbatpur coal mine and to attempt coal extraction with the support of ONGC and CIL,” he added. In its representations while surrendering the Parbatpur mine, SAIL had said there was a reduction in the area available for coal mining due to overlapping of mining area. SAIL had engaged MECON to prepare a techno commercial viability report, which declared the project unviable. The SAIL board had then decided to return the Parbatpur mine to the Coal Ministry on March 1.
Commenting on the present coal demand, another Coal Ministry official said the committed demand is being met. “The country’s coal supply is meeting 97-98 per cent of the annual contracted quantity. We are meeting a demand of 1.4 million tonnes per day and the coal production is growing at 10.5 per cent. As per the thermal programme, we are meeting 99 per cent of the coal demand,” he said.
“The demand for thermal power has been unprecedented. The country’s GDP grew roughly 7 per cent since 2015. But coal demand did not keep pace during 2015 and 2016. Now the coal production has been growing,” he added."

 State-owned CIL Friday said it produced 306.24 million tonne (MT) of coal in the first seven months of the ongoing fiscal, registering an increase of 10 per cent as compared to the year-ago period.
In the April-October period of 2017-18, the company’s coal production was 278.03 MT, Coal India Ltd (CIL) said in a statement. “The ‘maharatna’ coal miner has been maintaining a consistent double-digit production growth since the beginning of the financial year,” it said.
CIL supplied 22.2 MT more coal to the power sector during the period under review as compared to the corresponding year-ago seven months, it added.

44,2018-11-05,Coal India,"Coal India eases mine-specific supply policy for small consumers 
 Coal India Ltd has relaxed the norms for “mine-specific coal supply” policy, which would ease availability of the dry fuel to consumers having less than one million tonne of requirement per annum.
The move would benefit a large number of the mining major’s linked small consumers, the company said.
“The policy norms have been relaxed considerably to accommodate greater number of consumers under the ambit of the policy. The minimum per annum requirement of the consumer has been downsized to a quarter from 1 million tonne of coal to 0.25 million tonne,” a CIL official said.
The policy was conceived in 2011 to enable the consumer to benefit from assured supply from a preferred source, and gain from reduction in logistic costs.
However, the old policy was applicable to consumers having a minimum requirement of one million tonne of coal per annum. Further, the mine from which the coal was sourced had to have a capacity of 2.5 million tonne per annum.
The relaxed norms brings down the eligibility from 2.5 million tonne per annum production capacity to one million tonne per annum."

40,2018-11-19,Coal India,"NTPC fails to make use of CIL offer of additional coal
State-owned power major NTPC seems to have failed to make much use of Coal India’s (CIL) offer to lift an additional five million tonne fuel from mines. However, the fuel crisis has eased marginally because of lower demand with the onset of the winter and higher supply by CIL. 
On October 23, Coal India invited NTPC to lift an additional five million tonne (mt) coal from approximately 21 mt pit-head stock, within 30 days, to help mitigate the coal crisis. This was over and above the prevailing and committed supplies to NTPC. 
The power major was offered 1.5 mt from Amrapali and Magadh coal mines of Central Coalfields (Ranchi), 0.5 mt from BCCL (Dhanbad), 0.5 mt from NCL(Singrauli), etc. Coal could be hauled by using any mode of transportation and using CIL’s facility. 
There was no destination-wise restriction. NTPC could use the fuel in any of its plants. Also unlike the usual ‘cash and carry’ payment system, the power major could take fuel on credit. 
The intervention was timely, as a number of NTPC generation facilities were having barely two days’ fuel stock, which was lower than the then industry average of six days’ stock. 
 However, even after a month, NTPC seems to have failed to make much use of the facility. While responses were not available from the power major, coal sources confirmed that its pithead stock stands still at 21 mt, despite rise in daily supplies from 1.6 mt to 1.8 mt. 
The rise in CIL supplies seems to have a trailing effect on improving fuel stock position at the power plants.
According to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), from an average of six days’ stock, power plants are now having seven days’ stock. The number of non-pithead power stations having less than four days’ stock is down from 22 to 14. 
The supply situation will ease further once fuel starts moving from Amrapali and Magadh coal mines of CCL at greater speed. The construction of 44-km-long Tori-Shivpur line was over a few months ago. CCL has finalised contracts to evacuate 10 rakes a day. 
According to company sources, the movement is still slow as the contract is just operationalised and would peak with time. Meanwhile, Jharsuguda-Barapali rail-link, which was completed earlier this year, is witnessing movement of five rakes a day."

36,2018-12-24,Coal India,"Coal sector: Journey from monopoly to competition 
 By opening the door to private players for commercial mining, the coal sector this year witnessed its biggest reform in over four decades.
 However, it may still take some five-seven years before coal blocks are auctioned and results become visible as exploration and mine development for actual production of private commercial mines begin, say people associated with the coal sector.
 But, this has not deterred the management of Coal India to sensitise its employees about the looming threat that the private sector poses in the long run.
The world’s biggest coal miner has asked its staff to pull up their socks and embrace the new challenges facing them.
 Former Coal India chairman Partha Bhattacharyya observed that revenue maximisation should not be the only focus of the auction methodology and mining experience and core competence should get more weightage in the bidding process.
 He emphasised that in order to attract large domestic and global miners it is important to offer larger coal blocks, such as 50 MT annual capacity or more, for a period of about 25-30 years.
 Coal Minister Piyush Goyal had earlier said the reform is expected to bring efficiency to the coal sector by moving from an era of monopoly to competition.
 India is said to have coal reserves of up to 300 billion tonnes. The move of ending monopoly will also lead to greater energy security as 70 per cent of India’s electricity is generated from thermal power plants.
State-owned Coal India and Singareni Collieries Company together accounted for 91.6 per cent of the total coal produced in the country during FY2017-18.
 According to observers, CIL is unlikely to face major issue from privatisation beyond competitive pressure, as its prices are not import-linked and always been at a sharp discount despite its monopolistic position.
 Coal consumers are hoping that the move would address their long-pending demand of supply and quality constraints.
“Allowing private sector in coal mining is likely to increase supply and a competitive scenario will help in improving quality,” said Subhashri Chaudhuri, secretary general of the Coal Consumers Association of India.
 This far, coal mines were auctioned only for captive power generation.
 The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in February this year approved the methodology for auction of coal mines for sale of coal, the most ambitious coal sector reform since its nationalisation in 1973.
 The year also saw a sharp rise in dry fuel demand from the power sector owing to rise in electricity demand, drop in hydel generation among a few others and that led to higher coal imports as Coal India failed to meet the ‘sudden’ spike in demand.
 From April 1, 2018, to October 12 2018, Coal India Ltd had despatched 1.27 million tonnes (MT) of coal per day to the power sector as compared to 1.16 MT per day during the same period last year, a rise of 9 per cent.
 Overall, coal and coke imports during the first half of the current fiscal increased by 13.9 per cent to 119.42 MT.
 There had been allegations of the shortage of coal by several power plants during the last peak summer season. But, the allegations of short supply were also from non-power consumers also.
 Vedanta Ltd CEO Abhijit Pati recently complained saying, “Due to coal scarcity, power plants are operating at 60-70 per cent of their installed capacity which is ultimately hampering the interests of the state and nation.”
Owing to demand pressure, Coal India recently revised its production target to 652 million tonnes in FY2018-19 against the earlier estimate of 630 million tonnes.
 But, CIL chairman A K Jha had termed the revised production target of 652 million tonnes as ‘aspirational’
Northern Coalfields Ltd chairman P K Sinha said production is also linked to evacuation issues and unless it is addressed mere higher production will not help in actual supply.
 However, he said, several railway projects been taken up for new or doubling the lines including in the NCL areas and once completed these would help sharp increase in coal desptach to consumers."

Coal India FYTD volume growth slowed to 5.5 per cent, while the growth in August-December 2018 was mere 1 per cent despite severe shortage of coal, led by improved demand from power sector and pick-up in economic activity. 
Overall volumes growth would remain weak for rest of FY19e and FY20e due to poor rail connectivity at newly commissioned mines and peaked out road/belt route. We factor in 4.8 per cent/5.5 per cent growth in FY19e/FY20e. 
As happened in the past, margin rich e-auction volumes faced the brunt to meet the volumes tied-up in power and non-power FSAs. E-auction volumes/month fell by about 65 per cent in October-December 2018 to 2 million tonnes (mt) against average 60 mt. 
Given the limited buffer for E-auction due to strong demand in FSA and low production growth, we expect e-auction volumes to fall to four-year low at 65 mt/60 mt in FY19-FY20e. Led by weak operational performance and rising headwinds due to government policy on opening up the sector.

However, given stable power demand growth and coal stock at plants at only 10 days (versus 21days mandate) — we expect the coal offtake growth to continue as power plants continue re-stocking coal in FY19-20.

“Achieving 99 per cent and 99.5 per cent of the respective targets in coal production and coal off-take, CIL, during April-February period, surged ahead by nearly 32.62 million tonnes volume increase in production and 23.45 million tonnes increase in coal off-take, on a comparable period last year,” said a press statement issued by CIL. 
CIL’s planned target for the current fiscal is 610 mt for both production and offtake and it is hopeful of closing in on its production and offtake targets. Coal supplies to thermal power stations increased 29.30 mt during the said period registering a growth of 7.1 per cent. Total coal offtake to power sector by CIL during April-February was 440.8 mt (411.5 mt).
“CIL has achieved production of 58.05 mt for February, which incidentally is the highest for this particular month so far,” the release said.
CIL, on an average, loaded 206.2 rakes per day to the power sector against 198.7 rakes during the same period a year ago, clocking a growth of 3.8 per cent.
Coal stock at pitheads stood at a comfortable 34.76 mt at the end of February, which at the beginning of the current fiscal was 55.55 mt. The company liquidated 20.79 mt of its pithead coal stock during the 11 months of FY19."

21,2019-03-08,Coal India,"Coal India needs to up supply by at least 8% to meet GoM plan: report 
 National miner Coal India needs to ramp up its output by at least 8 per cent from the present levels if the group of ministers’ (GoM) recommendations on allowing domestic coal linkage for short-term PPAs are to be met, says a report.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had Thursday approved the GoM recommendations on stressed power projects which include allowing domestic coal supplies to short-term PPAs and increase coal supplies for special forward e-auction for the power sector.
“The measures approved such as allowing the use of domestic linkage coal for short-term PPAs and procurement of bulk power by nodal agencies against pre-declared linkages are a positive for thermal IPPs, given that coal-based operational capacities of 15-16 gw do not have long-term PPAs,” ICRA said in a report Friday.
It further said use of domestic coal will enable generators to offer more competitive tariffs for short-term sale, which is also likely to benefit discoms given that they purchase larger volumes through short-term PPAs.
“While the CCEA has recommended regular auction of coal linkages and increase in quantity of coal for special forward e-auction, this would require significant ramping up of production and supplies by Coal India.
“But for this to happen, increase in output would have to be at least 8 per cent up from the present levels under the assumption of 16 GW capacity operating at 50 percent PLF under the short-term/medium-term PPAs,” it said.
The report also notes that the government is focused on the medium-term PPA route to resolve the issue of lack of PPAs for coal-based IPPs as seen from the first 2.5 gw pilot scheme executed in 2018 and the second 2.5 gw scheme in January 2019. PTI PSK"

 The South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL) has become the first company in the country to have crossed coal production figure of 150 million tonnes in a financial year. The SECL achieved the record during the 2018-19 fiscal and crossed the 150 million tonnes mark on March 20, a company official said.
“In the wake of rising demand from the power sector, the SECL is striving hard to extract coal in full throttle. We have crossed 150 million tonnes on March 20 and are already at 153 million tonnes,” SECL chief manager (P&A) P Narendra Kumar told PTI.
SECL chairman and managing director A P Panda has taken all steps to expedite coal production as a result of which the SECL also touched the highest ever single day production of 7.44 lakh tonnes in this month, Kumar said. During FY 2017-18, the SECL had produced 144.7 million tonnes of coal.
SECL, the largest subsidiary of Coal India Ltd (CIL), contributes about a quarter of the dry fuel production for the holding company. The SECL has fared well at area level too. Dipka mine Area achieved the highest ever single day coal production of 1.45 lakh tonnes, while SECLs Gevra Mine achieved a single day coal production of 2.05 lakh tonnes in this month."

Despite registering a 7 per cent growth in production and 4.8 per cent rise in offtake, Coal India Ltd (CIL) has fallen short of its target of 610 million tonne (mt) for FY-19 marginally — by 3 mt and 2 mt, respectively. 
CIL produced around 607 mt of coal during 2018-19, a volume increase of close to 39.5 mt against the previous year’s production of 567.37 mt.
“The growth in coal production during the referred period is almost three-fold compared to last fiscal’s growth of 2.4 per cent,” said a press statement issued by the company.
The company’s subsidiaries — Eastern Coalfields (ECL), Northern Coalfields (NCL), Central Coalfields (CCL) and Western Coalfields (WCL) — have also surpassed their respective production targets for FY 2019.
Supply of coal to consuming sectors increased by 28 mt to 608 mt in 2018-19.
CIL supplied around 488 mt of coal to thermal power plants in FY19, compared with 454 mt supplied last fiscal, a growth of over 7 per cent.
Rake loading to the power sector grew 11.2 per cent, with CIL loading 255.6 rakes per day on an average to power stations as against 229.8 rakes per day in the year-ago period.
With increased supply, stocks at coal linkage-based power stations in the country swelled to 30.41 mt (as of March 28, 2019). 
This represents inventory of 18 days, close to the mandated 22 days. 
“At the end of FY 2019, not a single power station in the country is in the critical or supercritical list of Central Electricity Authority for want of coal. At the end of last fiscal, there were 28 power plants in critical mode,” the release said.
Coal stocks at CIL’s pitheads stood at around 54 mt at the end of FY19
With a total combined stock of 84.41 mt at power plants and pitheads, there is sufficient coal in the system to meet the country’s demand."
18,2019-04-11,Coal India,"Coal India picks PDIL as successful bidder to set up methanol plant in West Bengal
Projects and Development India Ltd (PDIL) is believed to have emerged as the successful bidder to provide engineering services for the setting up of a coal-based methanol plant in West Bengal by Coal India Ltd (CIL).
Even while two engineering consultancies — MN Dastur & Co and PDIL — were vying for the coveted project and MN Dastur emerged as the lowest bidder (L1), PDIL emerged as the successful bidder, an industry source told BusinessLine. 
The former was disqualified on ‘technical grounds’, and has challenged it before the Independent External Monitor (IEM). A senior CIL official said: “We had several rounds of meetings and another one with IEM is on for taking up their grievances. The IEM is examining it. I would not like to comment any further.” 
MN Dastur is, however, hopeful CIL will issue a letter of intent (LoI) to it soon. “We have emerged as L1; now it is in CIL’s hands. I hope they will issue the LoI soon,” said Abhijit Sarkar, Vice-President, MN Dastur. 
Once the LoI is issued, the chosen firm will be required to carry out a detailed report which involves initial investigation, technology selection and examining the feasibility of the entire project. It could take over a year for the detailed feasibility report to be prepared. 
With an aim to boost clean energy initiatives, CIL has been looking to set up a coal-based methanol plant at the Dankuni Coal Complex (DCC) of South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL), a subsidiary. It aims to produce 6.76 lakh tonnes of methanol per annum. The cost of the project is pegged at ₹4,500 crore.
The Centre recently eased the norms pertaining to extraction of natural gas and coal bed methane (CBM) from coal seams for the state-owned miner so as to facilitate methanol production. So CIL, which earlier had to apply for licence with the Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry to extract CBM from its coal seams, is now not required to do so. 
The foray into methanol production will help CIL diversify from coal into the chemicals business by converting the high calorific value, low ash thermal coal into chemicals.
Increasing the share of methanol in energy consumption is expected to help boost the country’s economy without increasing the carbon footprint. 
“Methanol can be used for partial substitution of petroleum. Import of petroleum is one of the biggest expenses of our country. As per our estimates, the country can substitute $15-20 billion of petroleum imports if we can actually develop this coal-to-methanol and scale it up,” Sarkar said."

How Coal India is keeping power stations humming 


As on May 9, the coal stock in power stations is a comfortable 18 days on an average




As on May 9, the coal stock in power stations is a comfortable 18 days on an average


 The summer is blazing, and collers and air-conditioners are roaring away, consuming power in vast quantities. Yet, there is no talk of any major power disruption due to shortage of coal. Clearly, Coal India Ltd has manges the situation well, unlike in earlier times.
In May 2018, when AK Jha took over as full-time Chairman of Coal India, the average fuel stock at 114 power stations listed by the Central Electricity Authority was of 10 days. Twenty-nine stations had less than seven days’ stock, and 19 with less than four days’. 
Since mid-2017, the fuel situation has been grave. The number of power stations with critical fuel stock has no doubt come down, but the average stock at plants had barely improved till this March. 
But as on May 9 this year, when many parts of India are in the grip of a heatwave and demand for electricity is touching new records, the coal stock at power stations is a comfortable 18 days on an average. Only three non-pithead power stations had less than seven days’ stock, and only two had less than four days’ stock. 
Between April and May, the total fuel stock at power stations was up from 30.5 million tonnes (mt) to 31.3 mt.
“A concerted effort from both production and marketing to smooth out supplies did the trick,” Jha told BusinessLine. 
That the coal supply mechanism has improved remarkably in the face of spiralling demand is evident. In 2014-15, the state-owned miner produced 494 mt of coal. Offtake (actual sales) was 489 mt. Approximately, 68 mt of fuel — equivalent to approximately seven weeks production — was lying at the pithead.
The situation was distinctly different at the end of the last fiscal. CIL produced 607 mt fuel but sold 608 mt and the pithead stock was 54 mt or four weeks production. “Our production and offtake were increasing but, pithead stock remained the same,” Jha said. High pithead stock indicates sub-optimal use of resources. 
But this doesn’t mean problems are over. “There are some plants with over 40 days coal stock and some having less than average fuel stock. This is mainly due to logistical problems in supplying fuel. Such problems are difficult to solve. Theoretically, there is little reason for Tamil Nadu to run coal-based plants more than 1,000 km away from the nearest coalfield in Odisha, when it is easier to buy power from Odisha or Chhattisgarh. 
Many State gencos are inefficient too. Yet they remain in operation for a variety of reasons ranging from financial management to local sentiments. 
There are many irritants on the coal production front too. Over-burden removal, which is a pre-requisite to producing fuel from opencast mines, suffered last year in a few subsidiaries due to aggressive bidding by contractors followed by reluctance in fulfilling contracts won at abnormally low prices.
Jha doesn’t promise any quick fix for such problems. But he promises that CIL will take another quantum jump in production and supplies this year."

During 2018-19, CIL’s share of despatch to power sector increased to 80 per cent from 78 per cent during the previous two years
   -  Bloomberg


State-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL) aims to increase the allocation of coal to power plants by nearly 9 per cent to around 530 million tonne (mt) during 2019-2020. 
Coal supply by CIL to power sector was 488 mt during 2018-19 almost 7.5 per cent higher than the 454 mt registered during 2017-18. 
During 2018-19, CIL’s share of despatch to power sector increased to 80 per cent from 78 per cent during the previous two years.
“Boosting despatch to power sector remained the focal area of CIL throughout 2018-19, as a result of which coal stocks with the power plants had increased from the low of 9.424 mt (equivalent to 6 days consumption level) to 30.947 mt (equivalent to 18 days consumption level) at the close of March 31, 2019,” said a press statement issued by CIL. 
The State-owned miner also succeeded in bringing down the number of power stations in critical stock list from 34 as on May 5, 2018 to ‘nil’ as on March 31, 2019. 
The window of special forward e-auction for power utilities was introduced mainly to cater to the needs of the power plants whose coal blocks had been deallocated and as the result of which tapering linkages were done away with. However, the introduction of ‘Shakti’ policy by the Central government in 2017-18, paved the way for such utilities to secure linkages from CIL. 
Coal linkages worth close to 27 mt per annum had been allocated in the first round of linkage auction conducted in 2017-18. Further, CIL signed Fuel Supply Agreements (FSA) for a capacity of 5,230 MW with power plants who were earlier issued LoA (Letter of Assurance), but whose commissioning was delayed beyond the stipulated timelines. 
This apart, CIL also issued linkages to 13 power plants with total capacity of 13,980 MW under various stages of commissioning. As many as 15 power plants which were allocated coal blocks for their captive use, but could not start coal production from the blocks, were also allocated bridge linkages to meet their coal requirement or shortfall of production during 2018-19. 
“All these plants were otherwise dependent on special forward e-auction window of CIL for sourcing domestic coal requirements. With the grant of regular and bridge linkages, dependency of large numbers of power plants had shifted from the special window of e-auction to institutional mechanism of supplies from CIL through FSAs and MoUs,” the release said.
In the wake of thrust to the power sector, the share of coal allocated under e-auction segment has come down to 12.6 per cent of production from 16.9 per cent in 2017-18 and 20.5 per cent in 2016-17."

 State-owned Coal India will hire merchant bankers to carry out financial due diligence for acquiring equity stakes in identified mines and companies in Australia as part of its plan to meet the growing dry fuel demand in the country.
The state-run miner has identified coal assets in Australia for acquiring equity stakes along with off-take rights in an asset or a company, Coal India said in a notice inviting proposals from investment bankers.
“CIL intends to avail the services of internationally reputed merchant banker/investment banker to carry out financial due diligence and render transaction advisory services with respect acquisition of stakes along with off-take rights in a coal asset in Australia held by a company for the purpose for arriving at an enterprise valuation of the company and framing of a non-binding Offer initially and followed by a final and binding offer,” the world’s largest coal miner said.
“A tender is being floated for engagement of merchant banker/ investment banker for assisting CIL in acquiring coal assets in Australia,” it said.
Coal India looks to acquire assets abroad as it expects that domestic production would not be sufficient to meet coking coal and high-grade fuel demand from various sectors. The demand-supply gap in India is high due to enhanced requirements from various sectors, including power and steel.
To meet the projected gap between demand and supply, while the efforts are on to enhance coal production from the indigenous sources, it will not be possible to bridge the entire gap of demand of coking coal and high-grade low ash thermal coal.
“In light of the above background Coal India Ltd...intends to set up coking coal and/or high-grade low ash thermal coal mining business overseas with a view to acquire coal resources, produce coal and import the produces to India by way of either opening new mines or equity participation in working mines on production sharing Participation Interest basis,” Coal India said.
Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output. The state-run miner produced around 607 million tonnes of coal in 2018-19 against the target of 610 million tonnes (MT).
Coal supplies to the consuming sectors rose by 4.8 per cent to touch a new high at 608 MTs in 2018-19 but lower than the target of 610 MT.
India’s coal import increased by 8.8 per cent to 233.56 million tonnes in 2018-19, according to a report. Non-coking coal imports were at 164.21 MT in 2018-19, about 13.25 per cent increase over 144.99 MT recorded in 2017-18. Coking coal import was almost flat at 47.73 MT last fiscal compared to 47.22 MT in 2017-18.

India may spin off units of Coal India Ltd, the world’s largest coal miner, into separate listed companies to boost competition and raise government funds, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The state-run company and the Coal Ministry are studying a proposal by the Finance Ministry’s Department of Investment & Public Asset Management to list four of Coal India’s biggest production units, as well as its exploration arm, said the people, who asked not to be named as the plan is not public. “The development is in an early stage and it was unclear how long it may take,” the people added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has sought to sell some state assets to raise funds, and these dinvestments will continue to remain a priority,
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said July 5, setting a record target of raising 1.05 trillion rupees ($15 billion) in the current fiscal year. Spinning off Coal India subsidiaries would also lead to greater competition in the domestic coal market and improve corporate governance, the people said.
A spokesman at Coal India did not respond to requests seeking comment, while press officials at the coal and finance ministries declined to comment.
The four units — Mahanadi Coalfields, South Eastern Coalfields, Northern Coalfields and Central Coalfields — account for more than three-fourths of the companys output, while constituting less than half of its workforce. The fifth unit would be Central Mine Planning & Design Institute.
India’s state run coal giant has been unable to meet growing demand despite abundant resources. Coal India produced a record 607 million metric tons in the last fiscal year to March, falling short by 22 per cent of a target proposed in 2017.
The goal has been revised a few times since then, but output was still just below a revised target. Meanwhile, imports of the fuel surged to a record over the same period."

 Coal India Ltd (CIL) has liquidated nearly 2,300 arrear rakes to the non-power segment since the beginning of this fiscal, thereby bringing down the backlog to the segment by more than 44 per cent.
The state-owned miner had arrears of over 5,100 rakes to the non-power sector, which had accumulated over the past two fiscals. CIL is hopeful of being able to clear the backlog in the next few months.
“CIL accelerated the loading of rakes to non-power sector consumers, since April 1 2019, reducing its backlog by more than 44 per cent in over a three-and-half month period as of July 21,” said a press statement issued by company. The bulk of non-power consumers constitute Captive Power Plants (CPPs) and cement sector followed by a host of other industries.
“With coal-fired power stations comfortably stocked with over 25 million tonnes (mt) of coal, coupled with 32 mt stock at pitheads of Coal India’s subsidiaries, there is sufficient coal in the system. This gives us the leeway to clear off all arrear rakes to non-power consumers in near future,” a company official said in the release.
It is to be noted that during mid-2016-17, there was a low demand for coal from the power sector and the subsidiary companies therefore shifted their booking for non-power group. However, from the second quarter of 2017-18, there was a sudden upsurge in demand for coal from the power plants. CIL, in a bid to boost the supplies to the stressed power utilities, rushed coal to their end on priority through the rail mode. This had impacted movement of rakes to the non-power sector, and as a result, the backlog kept building up for the bookings already made.
To ensure the need of non-power sector, CIL then offered coal to them through increased quantities by road.
However, with coal stocks at power plants stabilising, the situation has improved now, enabling the company to focus on stepping up supplies to the non-power sector, the release added."

Coal India Chairman Anil Kumar Jha on Wednesday said renewables are unlikely to surpass coal as the major source for power generation soon and asserted that India’s energy migration scenario will be different compared to many other countries.
State-owned Coal India accounts for nearly 83 per cent of the country’s coal production.
“The question is can renewables take over coal completely in our country? Not in the near future at least. It would not be an exaggeration to state that Coal India Ltd (CIL) is synonymous with India’s energy scenario,” Jha told shareholders at the company’s 45th annual general meeting here.
His remarks also come against the backdrop of increasing focus on renewable energy sources for the generation of power in different parts of the world.
Jha said the energy migration scenario in India would be “different”, compared to many other countries which have been switching to renewable sources.
According to him, nine mining projects having a total capacity of 69.88 million tonnes per year have been sanctioned and the estimated cost is ₹ 9,093 crore.
Besides, two rail projects with an outlay of ₹ 6,656 crore have been approved.
For the first time, Coal India had breached the 600 million tonnes-mark in production as well as off-take of coal.
The miner produced 606.89 million tonnes of coal and supplied 608.14 million tonnes of the dry fuel, representing growth of 6.97 per cent and 4.8 per cent, respectively, compared to the previous fiscal.
During the meeting, a shareholder, however, said he was disappointed watching stock price heading towards a lifetime low of ₹ 200 apiece, since the initial public offer nine years ago when the price was ₹ 235 per scrip.
At close, the shares of the company were down 3.41 per cent at ₹ 188.65 on the NSE."

 Anil Kumar Jha, Chairman, Coal India, on Friday said that the country could reduce the import of coal by nearly 50 per cent over the next three years.
India imported close to 235 million tonne (mt) of coal in 2018-19. Of this, coking coal constituted around 50 mt of the share. Another 70 mt was imported by power plants located in the coastal areas, as these imports made sense both logistically as well as on the cost front. However, the remaining 115-120 mt of imports can be substituted if domestic production is ramped up.
In FY19, the country produced around 730 mt of coal, while the consumption was close to 965-970 mt.
“As far as coking coal is concerned, India will continue to import so that 50 mt is irreplaceable. Out of the 190 mt of non-coking coal around 115-120 mt of coal can be replaced in the next three years with higher production and better evacuation,” Jha said.
He was addressing a press conference to announce the eighth Asian Mining Congress and the International Mining, Equipment, Minerals and Metals Exhibition to be organised by the Mining, Geological and Metallurgical Institute of India between November 6 and 9.
A majority of the import can be substituted by ramping up the Coal India’s production by around 50-55 mt every year for the next three years.
However, a conducive environment, such as availability of land as well as a favourable law and order situation was crucial for ""quantum"" jump in production from Coal India, he pointed out.
CIL had produced around 607 mt of coal in FY19 is likely to produce 53 mt more this year, taking the total production to around 660 mt. It is also looking at an incremental production of 50-55 mt each year for the next three years to be able to bridge the import gap.
The country’s largest miner is also aiming to achieve a production of one billion tonne by 2025-26."
5,2019-08-29,Coal India,"Coal India likely to retain dominant position despite opening up the sector


The world’s biggest coal miner is likely to hold on to its crown for now even as competition increases in India, which opened its doors to foreign miners to boost output and curb surging imports.
The South Asian economy will allow 100 per cent foreign direct investment in mining and sale of coal, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal told reporters in a briefing Wednesday, giving final shape to a reform he introduced as minister for coal in 2014. While that opens up the sector to private companies, both Indian and foreign, it will be a while before it reduces the dominance of monopoly producer Coal India Ltd., according to analysts with Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.

India’s coal demand is expected to rise with the addition of new thermal power plants and steel mills, making the nation a bright spot for coal miners in a world that is turning away from the dirty fuel. Still, difficulties in getting regulatory clearances, delays in land acquisition and shortages of railway rakes to haul the commodity may be a deterrent for foreign miners.
We are still some time away from merchant coal mining given the overarching presence of Coal India, Emkay analysts including Vishal Chandak said in a note Wednesday. Once the coal is mined, the new miner will have to compete with Coal India prices to sell or enter into long-term contracts for sale.
The state miner has a competitive advantage over other companies as it gets the mines for free, while others will have to participate in auctions to get access, raising their costs. At BSE, the shares of Coal India ended with a rise of 2.5 per cent to ₹189.75on Thursday, outperforming a 1.02 per cent decline in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex."

A day long strike by the trade unions of Coal India Limited (CIL) has not impacted the current coal stock availability at the thermal power plants. 
According to the National Power Portal, there are 114 power plants (out of 131) in the country with 12 days of coal stock available as on Monday (September 23). There are only three plants with less than four days of coal stock. Two plants have less than seven days of stock. This means that most of the thermal power plants in the country have adequate coal available with them.
The Minister for Coal and Mines, Pralhad Joshi, said that the situation will be normalised after the day-long strike, called by five CIL trade unions, namely the Indian National Mineworkers’ Federation (INTUC), Hind Khadan Mazdoor Federation (HMS), Indian Mineworkers’ Federation (AITUC), All India Coal Workers’ Federation (CITU) and All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU).
When speaking with journalists on Tuesday, Joshi also said that he is open to negotiation with the unions on their demand to roll back the decision to allow 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the coal mining sector.
This significantly improved coal stock availability can be a function of suppressed demand for power along with higher renewable energy and hydropower generation.
In the current financial year, till September 21, there has been a 5.05 per cent lower thermal power generation compared with the planned generation. This is a shortfall of 27,209.70 million units (actual generation was 511,917.30 million units). But, on the other hand, Nuclear power generation is up 9.36 per cent by 1,924.53 million units (total generation being 22,484.90 million units) and hydropower generation is up 9 per cent by 7,439.32 million units (total generation at 90,130.17 million units) from the planned generation during this period.
In total, there has been 2.73 per cent lower power generation than planned in the current financial year till last Saturday (September 21). This is a shortfall of 17,606.95 million units compared to the planned electricity generation during this period. The total generation stood at 628,176.33 million units from April 1, 2019 till September 21, 2019."

 State-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL) will develop 55 new coal mines and expand 193 existing ones in the next five years, Parliament was informed on Wednesday.
The company is also undertaking portal-based monitoring of ongoing projects to ensure their timely completion.
“Coal India has taken steps to boost its coal production, (including) opening of 55 greenfield projects having capacity of 92 MTPA (million tonne per annum) and expansion of 193 brownfield projects having capacity of about 310 MTPA in next five years,” Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi said in a reply to the Lok Sabha.
A new project on an unused land is called a greenfield project while the existing one that is modified or upgraded is called a brownfield project.
Besides, CIL has introduced technology “to improve its work efficiency with high capacity Heavy Earth Moving Machinery, like 42 cum Shovel and 240 T Rear Dumpers in Gevra Expansion, Dipka & Kusmunda opencast mines (and) introduction of surface miners in opencast mines to improve operational efficiency and to cater to environmental needs.” 
During 2018-19, around 50 per cent of the opencast coal production in CIL was through surface miners.
Further, in order to reduce import of coal, CIL is taking up source rationalisation with part supply from higher grade coal sources.
More coal from various sources was offered through e-auction schemes, particularly special forward e-auction, for power consumers, not having fuel supply agreement with CIL sources."
0,﻿2019-12-11,Coal India,"CAG blames improper deployment of manpower to monitor environmental impact of Coal India


The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has highlighted inconsistencies in deployment of manpower for monitoring the environmental impact of Coal India’s activities.
This observation has been made in the CAG report on assessment of environmental impact due to mining activities and its mitigation in Coal India Ltd (CIL) and its subsidiaries.
“While the deployment of executives exceeded the sanctioned strength at CIL Headquarters (HQ) in all the years, it fell short at mines, during the period 2013-2018. The extent of excess deployment in CIL HQ ranged between 20 and 120 per cent of the sanctioned strength during 2013-2018,” the CAG said.
On the other hand, “North Eastern Coalfield (NEC) mines experienced shortage of executives ranging between 33 and 100 per cent. There were inconsistencies in deployment of manpower for environmental activities in the subsidiaries too,” the CAG noted.
The CAG also noted that even after a lapse of nine years, since Jharia Master Plan was approved, CIL subsidiary Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) did not formulate fire fighting activities as envisaged. 
“Fire fighting activities commenced only in 25 projects (as against 45 projects identified). The fires thus continued to endanger the lives of the people residing in and around the fire area, besides adversely impacting the environment,” the CAG said.
Suggesting steps that could be taken, the CAG said, “The CIL subsidiaries may adopt two-pronged strategy for pollution control. The capital works relating to pollution control measures may be completed expeditiously. The plantation works may also be taken up simultaneously and aggressively to increase green cover and restore ecological balance in and around the mines.”"
