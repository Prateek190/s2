96,2018-01-09,BPCL,"Crude prices gallop on: OMCs to be in focus
Shares of oil marketing companies (OMCs) such as Hindustan Petroleum Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Indian Oil may come under pressure with crude oil prices zipping past the $66 mark at NYMEX, and $60 at ICE.
Though a stable rupee (against the greenback) is a comforting factor, further rise in crude oil prices could impact these companies heavily. However, ONGC and Reliance Industries could benefit as their refining margins would improve."
97,2018-01-09,BPCL,"IOC, BPCL keen to acquire GAIL
Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) are both keen to acquire gas utility GAIL India Ltd to become fully integrated energy companies.
IOC and BPCL have separately indicated to the petroleum ministry their interest in taking over GAIL to help add natural gas transportation and marketing business to their kitty, official sources said.
GAIL, on the other hand, feels a merger with oil and gas producer ONGC would be more appropriate.
The merger options were indicated following Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s announcement in the 2017-18 Budget speech on the government’s plan to create integrated public sector oil majors that will be “able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies“.
ONGC, India’s largest oil and gas producer, proposed to acquire oil refiner and fuel marketing company HPCL, which was approved by the Cabinet. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is currently in the process of acquiring the government’s 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL, which at current prices is worth over Rs 33,000 crore.
Sources said IOC and BPCL gave separate options for the integration.
The government’s 54.89 per cent stake in GAIL is currently worth about Rs 46,700 crore.
Integration options suggested by other companies would be taken up only after ONGC-HPCL merger is complete, they said.
IOC, the largest oil refiner and fuel marketing company in the country, wanted to either acquire another refiner to add to its capacity or a gas company like GAIL.
The firm feels it already has a fledging gas business in under-construction LNG terminals, city gas distribution projects and gas marketing. GAIL, the nation’s biggest gas transporter and marketing company, would complement that, it felt.
BPCL on the other hand too has natural gas ambitions and wrote to the oil ministry saying GAIL was its number one choice for acquisition. It listed Oil India Ltd (OIL), the nation’s second largest exploration firm, as its number two choice."

101,2018-01-09,BPCL,"IOC, BPCL set rates for VLCC, Suezmax tanker


Size is everything In the last five years, VLCC rates have touched $57,750 per day for a one-year charter and $45,000 per day for a three-year charter




Size is everything In the last five years, VLCC rates have touched $57,750 per day for a one-year charter and $45,000 per day for a three-year charter


Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) will benchmark the rates for a very large crude carrier (VLCC) and a Suezmax tanker, respectively, they plan to hire from local fleet owners for five years to the Clarksons index that are also subject to a floor (minimum rate) and a cap (maximum rate).
IOCL has set a floor rate of $18,000 per day and a cap of $40,000 per day for hiring a 10-year old VLCC that can carry as much as 265,000 million tonnes of Basrah light crude for five years with an option to extend the contract for two years, according to the tender reviewed by BusinessLine.
BPCL has set a floor rate of $15,000 per day and a cap of $27,000 per day for hiring a ten-year-old Suezmax tanker that can carry as much as 130,000 mt of crude oil for five years that is extendable by two years, according to the tender issued by BPCL.




The charter hire under the contracts will be linked to one-year time charter rates for 310,000 and 150,000 dead weight tonnes (dwt) vessels indicated in Clarksons Research’s Shipping Intelligence Weekly publication. This weekly market rate shall be averaged out considering all weekly publications during the preceding year from January 1 to Decmeber 31 to arrive at the base charter hire rate for the next year.
The fleet owners quoting the maximum discount or lowest premium in percentage on the base charter hire rate so determined will win the deal. The discount / premium agreed by ship owners shall be valid for the entire duration of contract including optional period. However, the base charter hire rate shall be reset every year based on immediate previous year’s average of one-year time charter rate indicated in Clarksons Research’s Shipping Intelligence Weekly publication.
For example, if the average of weekly market rates of one-year time charter published in Clarksons Research’s Shipping Intelligence Weekly publication during this yearthe year 2017 works out to $18,601 per day and the agreed premium is 10 per cent, the charter-hire payable to owners during 2018 shall be 18,601 + 10% = $20,461 per day. Assuming it to be discount, the payable charter-hire during 2018 shall be 18,601-10% = $16,741 per day.
However, if the charter hire net of agreed discount / premium works out to be less than floor rate, the charter hire payable shall be the floor rate. But, if the charter hire net of discount / premium works out to more than the cap rate, then the payable charter hire shall be the cap rate.
Such floor and cap rate will be valid for the entire contract period including optional period.
“It’s is a very aggressive floor and cap set by the state-run oil refiners,” says Pawan Gupta, an independent shipping consultant. “We had suggested a floor rate of $18,000 per day and a cap of $36,000 per day for the VLCC. IOCL made it $18,000 and $40,000. Actually, it is good for ship owners,” he said.
“It is not a win-win situation,” says another Mumbai-based shipping consultant. “It is not in favour of owners because if the market goes up, their ability to get a premium will be restricted to $40,000 for VLCC and $27,000 for Suezmax carriers”. Besides, for financing purposes, this model will be less attractive than a fixed rate. Banks will favour a fixed rate than the floor and cap rate because of the risks involved, he added.




The current market rate for hiring a VLCC for three years is $29,250 per day while the rate for a Suezmax carrier is $22,500 per day, according to Allied Shipping Research.
In the last five years, the VLCC rates had touched $ 57,750 per day for a one-year charter and $45,000 per day for a three-year charter.
In the case of Suezmax tankers, the rate had reached $42,500 per day for a one-year charter and $35,000 per day for a three-year charter."
102,2018-01-09,BPCL,"Oil marketing cos fall as crude prices hit 2-year high
Shares of oil marketing companies fell as crude prices hit 2-year high. OMCs were among the top percentage losers on the NSE index.
Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd shares fell as much as 2.3 per cent to Rs 420, lowest since November 23, while Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Indian Oil Corp Ltd slipped as much as 1.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively.
US oil prices hit their highest levels in more than two years on Friday following the continued shutdown of the Keystone pipeline; the prices eased on Monday on the prospect of increased US output.
“Crude oil prices are moving up, which is negative for the oil marketing companies and that's pushing the stocks of OMCs down,” says Sudeep Anand, IDBI Capital.
Meanwhile, oil explorers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd rose as much as 1.66 per cent to Rs 184, highest since November 14."
103,2018-01-09,BPCL,"Ready to supply Euro-VI fuel to Delhi from April: IOC
Euro-VI grade petrol and diesel will be supplied to the national Capital by three oil PSUs from their refineries at Mathura, Bina and Bhatinda from April to help it fight the alarming levels of air pollution.
“We will be able to meet the requirement of Delhi from April 1,” IOC Chairman Sanjiv Singh said here today.
“We will have to tweak the fuel production slate to produce BS-VI (equivalent to fuel meeting Euro-VI emission norms), he added.
The nation’s biggest oil firm, IOC will source the fuel from its Mathura refinery, while Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) will do so from its joint venture refinery at Bhatinda.
Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) supplies the fuel from its Bina refinery.
“Meeting Delhi’s requirement of BS-VI grade petrol and diesel will not be a problem,” Singh said.
He added, however, that meeting the requirement of the National Capital Region (NCR) will be a challenge as it consumes about 10 per cent of the nation’s fuel.
India had in 2015 decided to leapfrog to Euro-VI emission norm compliant petrol and diesel from April 2020, from the Euro-IV grade at present.
While the deadline for the rest of the country stands, for Delhi, which is choking on thick toxic smog, the deadline for introduction of BS-VI, equivalent to Euro-VI grade, was last week preponed to April 2018.
Euro-VI grade fuel contains 10 parts per million (ppm) of sulphur as against 50 ppm in Euro-IV fuels.
Delhi consumed 906,000 tonnes of petrol and 1.26 million tonnes diesel in 2016-17, Singh said.
Oil firms have been asked to examine the possibility of introduction of BS-VI auto fuels in the entire NCR, which includes the adjoining cities of Ghaziabad, Noida, Gurgaon and Faridabad, from April 1, 2019.
In all likelihood, according to some industry players, supplies in the NCR may not begin by 2019.
The BS-IV emission norm was introduced across the country from April 1, 2017.
Oil refineries will need to invest Rs 28,000 crore in upgrading petrol and diesel quality to meet cleaner fuel specifications by 2020.
According to IOC, for petrol engines, one of the critical specifications is Research Octane No. (RON), which has improved from 88 in BS-II to 91. It is at par with regular 91 octane gasoline (petrol) required for Euro VI emission norms.
Sulphur specification for petrol and diesel will be reduced 50 times for a level of 500 ppm for BS-II fuel to 10 ppm in BS-VI.
Previously, the fuels meeting Euro-IV or Bharat Stage (BS)-IV specifications were to be supplied throughout the country by April 2017 and BS-V or Euro-V grade fuel by April 1, 2020.
But now the government plans to switch over directly from BS-IV to BS-VI auto fuels.
Oil refineries had previously upgraded their technology and invested over Rs 55,000 crore for production and supply of BS-III/IV fuels."

Investors with a short-term perspective can consider selling the stock of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) at current levels. The stock has been in a medium-term uptrend since taking support at ₹400 in late June 2017. But, this uptrend encountered a key resistance in the band between ₹540 and ₹550 in early September this year. This resistance band again capped the stock's rally in late October and has become a significant medium-term hurdle. The stock subsequently changed direction triggered by negative divergence in the daily relative strength index. For the past two weeks, the stock has been trending down. In last two days, the stock has tumbled almost 4 per cent breaching a key support at₹ 505. Moreover, the stock trades well below its 21 and 50-day moving averages. The daily RSI has entered the bearish zone from the neutral region. Both the daily and weekly price rate of change indicators feature in the negative territory implying selling interest. The short-term outlook is bearish for the stock. It can extend its downtrend and reach the price targets of ₹475 and ₹465 in the ensuing trading sessions. Sell the stock with a stop-loss at ₹502.

Shares of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd fell as much as 2.10-2.90 per cent.

Shares of oil marketing companies fell as Brent crude hit over 2-year high. Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd fell as much as 2.10-2.90 per cent.


Brent crude oil prices jumped above $65 per barrel for first time since June 2015 after a shutdown of Forties North Sea pipeline knocked out significant supply.
Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $65.07 a barrel at 0211 GMT, up 37 cents, or 0.6 per cent from their last close. It was the first time Brent rose above $65 since June 2015.

95,2018-01-24,BPCL,"SCI, Great Eastern, Essar Shipping bid for IOC and BPCL’s long-term tanker charter
Despite scepticism on the terms of the tender, ship owners such as Shipping Corporation of India Ltd, Great Eastern Shipping Co Ltd and Essar Shipping Ltd have applied on separate tenders issued by Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) to hire an oil super tanker and a Suezmax tanker, respectively, for five years each.
The tenders for the first long-term cargo support contracts to be tried out in India at the behest of the Central government, closed on January 22. The five-year contracts are designed to help shipowners raise funds at low rates to expand fleet.
The tenders incorporate a so-called right of first refusal to Indian shipowners — if Indian fleet owners are not the lowest bidders to haul the cargo, they are offered an opportunity to match the lowest rate quoted by a foreign ship-owner and take the contract.
IOC and BPCL will benchmark the rates for a very large crude carrier (VLCC) and a Suezmax tanker, respectively, they plan to hire to the Clarksons index which are also subject to a floor (minimum rate) and a cap (maximum rate).
IOC has set a floor rate of $18,000 a day and a cap of $40,000 a day for hiring a 10-year old VLCC that can carry as much as 265,000 million tonnes (MT) of Basrah light crude for five years with an option to extend the contract for two years, according to the tender reviewed by BusinessLine.
BPCL has set a floor rate of $15,000 per day and a cap of $27,000 per day for hiring a 10-year old Suezmax tanker that can carry as much as 130,000 mt of crude oil for five years which is extendable by two years, according to the tender issued by BPCL.
The charter hire under the contracts will be linked to one-year time charter rates for 310,000 and 150,000 dead weight tonnes (dwt) vessels indicated in Clarksons Research’s Shipping Intelligence Weekly publication. This weekly market rate shall be averaged out considering all weekly publications during the preceding year from January 1 to December 31 to arrive at the base charter hire rate for the next year.
The fleet owners quoting the maximum discount or lowest premium in percentage on the base charter hire rate so determined will win the deal.
The discount / premium agreed by ship owners shall be valid for the entire duration of contract, including optional period. However, the base charter hire rate shall be reset every year based on immediate previous year’s average of one-year time charter rate indicated in Clarksons Research’s Shipping Intelligence Weekly publication.
Besides, the state-run oil refiners have set a 10-year age limit for qualifying ships because by the time the five-year contract ends, the ships will be 15-years-old, reaching the threshold prescribed by most of the crude oil loading terminals globally, particularly for VLCCs.
To be sure, fleet owners who don’t have the requisite ships while submitting offers are allowed by IOC and BPCL to participate in the tender by showing relevant proof of acquisition of such ships, which should be converted into Indian flag within six months of winning the contract.
“The returns matrix will not work out for this type of floating rate contracts,” said an executive with an Indian shipping company that has rented ships to oil refiners. “It is not a financially viable proposal for anybody including the banks,” he said."

At least three contenders, including BPCL, are vying for Nagarjuna Oil’s 6-million-tonne-a-year refinery that is on the block under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process.
According to sources, the public sector oil marketing company BPCL is among those likely to submit a resolution plan. 
Others are an Oman-based company and another from Singapore, a source said declining to give more details.
Major consultants, including KPMG and Fox Mandal, are handling the due-diligence. 
The State government is likely to recommit itself to a structured package of incentives that was formulated for the refinery project, Tamil Nadu’s largest private sector investment. 
Sources said the MoU signed during the Global Investors Meet in 2015, which is effective, will be renewed to shore up investor confidence. 
Project delay
With over 2,180 acres available with the project, and potential to acquire an additional 1,000-acre contiguous land, investors can expand the project to 30 million tonnes a year. This makes it an attractive proposition, the source said.
The Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Oil Corporation was setting up the refinery at Cuddalore on the East Coast about 200 km to the south of Chennai. 
Time and cost over-runs resulted in the ₹3,500-crore project planned to start in 2002 growing to ₹12,500-18,000 crore. In December 2011, the project site was hit by a cyclone and was stalled.
The total investment in the project at that time was estimated at ₹8,000 crore, including ₹4,500 crore expenditure and ₹3,500 crore interest. A consortium of 17 banks, which funded the project, was to have brought in an additional ₹7,000 crore debt as part of a restructure which did not materialise. 
The Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Oil refinery, which promoted the project held a 46.78 per cent stake (77.62 crore shares) in Nagarjuna Oil Corporation. Other shareholders in the project include TIDCO, the Tamil Nadu government industry promotion agency, with 1.65 per cent; Trafigura 19.79 per cent; Tata Sons 12.70 per cent; Tata Petrodyne 12.11 per cent; Cuddalore Port Co 3.66 per cent and Udhe Gmbh 3.31 per cent."

An equal joint venture between state-run oil refiners Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) has won the rights to develop and run a liquid terminal at Kamarajar Port Ltd near Chennai.
The consortium — the only group to put in a price bid on a public tender — was awarded the ₹393-crore, 3-million-tonne (mt) capacity project a few days ago, a spokesman for the port said. The BPCL-HPCL consortium had quoted a revenue share of 23 per cent for the new facility which seeks to tap into the growing demand for POL, LPG products and Lube Oil Base stock (LOBS) in bulk in Tamil Nadu and neighbouring States. The terminal is expected to start operations in 2020-21.
Kamarajar Port Ltd, the entity that runs the port at Ennore, is among the 12 ports owned by the Central government and the only one to be run as a company. The other ports are run as trusts. Cargo contracts at Central government-run ports were till now decided on the basis of revenue share — the entity willing to share the most from its annual revenue will win the deal, typically lasting 30 years.
Bids for new projects will be decided on the basis of the highest royalty per metric tonne or twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) handled which would be indexed to variations in the wholesale price index (WPI).
This will replace the method of charging royalty which is equal to the percentage of gross revenue, quoted during bidding, calculated on the basis of upfront normative tariff ceiling prescribed by Tariff Authority for Major Ports (TAMP), the rate regulator for the major ports.
When commissioned, the HPCL-BPCL facility will be the second liquid terminal at Kamarajar Port. Ennore Tank Terminals Pvt Ltd, the entity led by IMC Ltd, runs a 3-mt capacity liquid terminal at the port from 2009.
State-owned Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) is developing a captive oil jetty at Kamarajar Port to handle POL, LPG and LOBS with an investment of ₹480 crore. The facility is also expected to start operations in 2020-21."
91,2018-03-19,BPCL,"IndianOil, BPCL fall on reports of stake buy in GAIL
 Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC) fell as much as 4.7 per cent to Rs 176, its lowest since January 31, 2017. Similarly, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd too dropped as much as 4.1 per cent to Rs 429.
A PTI report said Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum may buy 26 per cent stake each in gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd, paying the government over Rs 20,000 crore each to become integrated energy firms.
IOC and BPCL may split the government's stake in GAIL equally among themselves making it their subsidiary, and GAIL will continue to operate as a listed company with an independent board, the report said. IOC, BPCL and GAIL are unrelated businesses and since the government needs money they are forcing IOC and BPCL to pay out for its stake in GAIL, Nitin Tiwari, an analyst with Antique Stockbroking, said.
Also, IOC and BPCL have a fair amount of debt on their balance sheets and on top of that they will be adding more debt to pay for the transaction, so there is a negative implication related to that, Tiwari added.
Shares of GAIL rose as much as 1.6 per cent to Rs 448.
The companies did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request seeking comment."
90,2018-03-22,BPCL,"BPCL top bidder for Nagarjuna Oil project in TN
BPCL, the public sector oil marketing company, has emerged the main contender to revive the stalled Nagarjuna Oil Corporation’s refinery project in Tamil Nadu.
With the committee of creditors appointed by NCLT to meet tomorrow to consider the bids, there are just two bidders in the fray. One is the public sector company and the other an unlisted venture for the creditors to consider, according to reliable sources.
The Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Oil Corporation was setting up the 6-million-tonne a year refinery at Cuddalore on the East Coast about 200 km to the south of Chennai. The project scheduled to start in 2002 was hit by cost over-runs. Project cost ballooned to ₹12,500 crore from ₹3,500 crore initially. In December 2011, the project site was hit by a cyclone and was stalled.
The total investment in the project at that time was estimated at ₹8,000 crore, including ₹4,500 crore expenditure and ₹3,500 crore interest. A consortium of 17 banks led by IDBI which funded the project was to have brought in an additional ₹7,000 crore debt as part of a restructure which did not materialise. 
NCLT appointed a Resolution Professional last July after a bidder, Netoil Consortium, which was to bring in over ₹3,800 crore as part of a one-time settlement, failed to bring in funds. The State government had cleared a structured package of incentives to Netoil during the Global Investors Meet in 2015."
89,2018-03-31,BPCL,"Delhi to get only BS VI grade fuel from April 1
All fuel retail outlets in the national Capital will offer Bharat Stage VI grade petrol and diesel from April 1, said the Director (Refineries) B V Rama Gopal. Speaking to reporters, Gopal said, “There are 186 Indian Oil fuel retail outlets in the national Capital. These will be supplied by only BS VI grade fuel from April 1.”
In all there are 391 retail outlets in the Capital, including those of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. They too will be supplied by BS VI from their own refineries, Gopal added.
An Indian Oil statement said, “The expenditure incurred at the Panipat Refinery for supplying BS VI products is nearly ₹183 crore for replacement of major units, while at Mathura, the product has been supplied by adjusting operating parameters of secondary units.”

 Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said the government is open to Saudi oil giant Aramco’s interest to own majority stake in the proposed Rs 3-trillion refinery at Ratnagiri, which when completed will be the largest single location refinery complex in the world with a capacity of 60 million tonne.
 Saudi Aramco has reportedly sought majority ownership in the mega refinery-cum-petrochemical complex for which state-owned oil firms Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have inked an agreement.
 “Aramco is in discussions with us. We have held many rounds of talks on the Ratnagiri project with them. It’s a commercial project and we are open to their suggestion (of giving majority stake),” Pradhan told PTI here over the weekend.
The minister was responding to a question on whether the world’s largest oil company that is working on a USD 1-trillion initial public float this year, has really sought majority stake in the project.
 Some media reports had last month said the Saudis were interested in the USD 40-billion project provided India was ready to offer majority control and that the facility will mostly use Saudi crude.
When specifically asked whether the government was ready to offer majority stake in the project, Pradhan said “yes”, though did not quantify their demand.
“Yes it’s a commercial project and the ownership is still open,” said the minister.
IOC currently owns a 50 per cent stake in the project, with the remainder is equally split between BPCL and HPCL.
When asked about the status of the Ratnagiri refinery, especially land procurement in the face of stiff opposition from the public as well as the ruling BJP ally Shiv Sena, Pradhan said, “I am optimistic that everything can be resolved through discussions. Every issue can be discussed and resolved with talks. Let’s see.” 
Once all the clearances are in, it will at least five to six years for the refinery to commence production. The refinery will include three crude units of 20 million tonnes each and will produce petrol, diesel, LPG, aviation turbine fuel (ATF) and feedstock for making petrochemicals such as plastics, chemicals and textiles.
While the project will give IOC a strong foothold in the western states as catering to customers in the west and the south is difficult with its refineries located mostly in the north, for HPCL and BPCL this will increase their capacity as their Mumbai refineries cannot be expanded further.
Currently the country has a refining capacity of a little over 232 million tonne, against the domestic demand of 194.2 million tonne in fiscal 2017. According to the International Energy Agency, this demand is expected to reach 458 million tonne by 2040. The country is the world’s third-biggest oil importer.
IOC has 11 refineries with a capacity of 81.2 million tonne, while BPCL runs four with a capacity of 33.4 million tonne and HPCL operates three refineries with a capacity of 24.8 million tonne.
Saudi’s interest in the project can be seen as securing its future with a large customer as increasing India has been moving away from Saudi to other markets like Africa, Latin America and even the US.
Also, in the first week of March, Iraq overtook Saudi by a wide margin to become India’s top crude supplier, meeting over a fifth of the oil needs.
Saudi, has traditionally been the top oil source for India, but in the April-January period of 2017-18, Iraq shipped 38.9 million tonne, which is more than 20 per cent of the annul imports."

The authorities concerned have again extended the bid date for Nagarjuna Oil Corporation’s refinery project in Tamil Nadu even as BPCL continues to remain the sole bidder, according to reliable sources.
Last month after the first deadline ran out with the public sector oil company BPCL the sole bidder for the project, the NCLT-appointed Resolution Professional and the Committee of Creditors had extended the last date to March 31. 
According to the source, BPCL’s resolution plan had fallen short of expectations. 
But even after the extended time, there have not been any fresh bidders and BPCL is the only contender for the project. 
But the Resolution Professionals and the Committee of Creditors have chosen to further extend the deadline, according to the source. 
The RP concerned was not available for comment. 
The project was promoted by the Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Group. Following project delay and cost over-runs, it came under the purview of the NCLT last year and a resolution professional called for bids last October.

Taking another step towards making the proposal for a mega refinery in the country’s west coast a reality, an Indian consortium consisting of Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation signed an MoU with Saudi Aramco here on the sidelines of the16 International Energy Forum Ministerial. 
Speaking to mediapersons after signing of the MoU to jointly develop and build an integrated refinery and petrochemicals complex, Ratnagiri Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, in Maharashtra, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Dharmendra Pradhan, said, “The project cost is estimated at around ₹3 lakh crore ($44 billion). The refinery will be capable of processing 1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day (60 million tonnes per annum).”
The project will be set up as a 50:50 joint partnership (50:50) between the consortium from India and Saudi Aramco, Pradhan said. The plan is to finish the project by 2025.
Khalid Al Falih, Minister for Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, Saudi Arabia, who was present on the occasion, said: “Saudi Aramco may include a strategic partner to co-invest in the project”. 
Elaborating on the refinery project, he said, the partnership brings together crude supply, resources, technologies, experience and expertise of multiple oil companies with an established commercial presence around the world.
A pre-feasibility study for the refinery has been completed, and the parties are now finalising the project’s overall configuration including the formation of a joint venture that would provide for joint ownership, control and management of the project.
In addition to the refinery, cracker and downstream petrochemicals facilities, the project will also include the development of associated facilities such as a logistics, crude oil and product storage terminals, raw water supply project and centralised and shared utilities.
Amin H. Nasser, Saudi Aramco’s President and CEO, said participating in the mega project will allow the Saudi Arabian oil company to go beyond the role of crude oil supplier to a fully integrated position which supports India’s future energy demands. 
It will produce a range of refined petroleum products, including petrol and diesel meeting BS-VI fuel efficiency norms. The refinery will also provide feedstock for the integrated petrochemicals complex, which will be capable of producing approximately 18 million tonnes per annum of petrochemical products."

 Three major public sector oil companies today announced that they would be distributing 70,000 LPG connections in the state on April 20 to households living Below Poverty Line (BPL).
“To popularise the use of clean fuel for cooking among the rural population of the country, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has decided to celebrate April 20 as Ujjwala Diwas,” said Executive Director, Gujarat, Indian Oil Corporation, S S Lamba, at a press meet here today.
On that day, around 15,000 ‘LPG panchayats’ will be held across the country under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), Lamba said.
“In Gujarat, distributors of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) would organise 701 such LPG panchayats on April 20. Our target is to give around 70,000 new LPG connections by enrolling 100 beneficiaries at each of these 701 community gatherings” said Lamba, who is also the state level coordinator of oil marketing companies in Gujarat.
 “LPG panchayat will serve as an interactive platform between existing customers, officials and those who are interested to switch to LPG. Each meeting is aimed at bringing together 500 women from nearby areas and thereby providing 100 new connections at each of these panchayats on that day” he said.
Since its launch in May 2016 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, around 12.75 lakh LPG connections under the PMUY scheme have been provided to eligible BPL beneficiaries in Gujarat, where the total number of LPG connections stood at 85 lakh, he said.
He said as many as 3.58 crore LPG connections have been provided to BPL families across the country since the programme was launched.
 “When the scheme was launched in 2016, our target was 5 crore connections, out of which, we have enrolled 3.58 crore already. However, from this month, the target has been revised to 8 crore, to be covered by 2020, due to the addition of seven new categories who can be covered under the scheme” said Lamba."

BPCL-Kochi Refinery's SPM facility for crude oil on the high seas off Kochi, has received the 1000th crude oil tanker, since it was commissioned in 2007.


 MT Mogra, the Suez Max tanker has become the 1000th crude oil tanker to berth at the Single Point Mooring facility of BPCL-Kochi Refinery, located 19.2 km from the coast of Puthuvypeen. The vessel carried approx 140 TMT of Basrah light crude from Iraq to the Kochi coast.
SPM is a modern facility to receive crude oil in large oil tankers such as the Suez Max and Very Large Crude Carriers. SPM has a floating buoy anchored to the seabed using anchor chains secured on piles. This buoy comprises floating hoses and sub-sea hoses for cargo transport. The oil tankers are moored to the buoy and crude oil is pumped through the hoses to the sub-sea pipeline running from the SPM to the in-shore tank farm in Puthuvypeen.
Approximately 109 million tonnes of crude from various countries has been received at SPM, which was introduced in the Kochi waters off the coast of Puthuvypeen in 2007 to enable crude oil receipt from very large crude carriers. Among the 1,000 tankers that have berthed here, a sizeable number comprised VLCC tankers also.

There was no immediate response from BPCL on Reuters' email seeking comments.

Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) is preparing a strategy blueprint to venture into the petrochemicals business in a big way, the firm’s Chairman and Managing Director, D Rajkumar, said on Wednesday.
The state-run oil refiner has also started work on shifting some facilities, such as LPG storage tanks that are not required in the premises of its Mumbai refinery, which was hit by a recent fire in the hydro-cracker unit, to enhance safety.
“We have taken board approval for our petrochemical strategy and this will be both commodity and niche derivatives,” Rajkumar said. “What, when and how will be worked out soon,” he said.
BPCL has taken the initial steps to enter the petrochemicals business by investing around Rs 5,000 crore in a Propylene Derivatives Petrochemical Project (PDPP) as part of the Integrated Refinery Expansion Project in Kochi Refinery. The PDPP is slated to start operations by March 2019, producing “three specific petrochemicals”.
“As a strategy, all future expansion plans of BPCL group refineries will be oriented towards production of petrochemicals,” he said.
While all the oil marketing companies are concentrating on and maximising transportation fuels, going forward, because of the market dynamics, all the OMCs will move towards petrochemicals, which would also form a larger chunk in their portfolio, Rajkumar said.
The fire in the hydro cracker unit of the refinery happened not because of an operational failure or any slip-up on the part of refinery operations. “It turned out to be a material failure,” he said, adding that the loss has been estimated at around Rs 97 crore, for which a claim would be filed with insurers. “This has opened up a number of questions, how material can fail and that is being investigated,” the CMD said.
“As far as the Mumbai refinery is concerned, we are looking to shift some of the facilities that are not required in the refinery premises, including the LPG facilities,” Rajkumar said. 
“Currently, there are a number of lorries plying in the area. Once this is shifted, there will be a 43 per cent reduction in the tanker lorry movement in that region. People living in the vicinity had been seeking a reduction in road movement; this was the thinking within the organisation as well. Fortunately, we were able to get some land in Rasayani and we want to see how much more land is available and identify the facilities that can be shifted. We have got environment clearance for shifting the LPG facilities to Rasayani, and we are also working on the design. In 24-30 months’ time, we would see the LPG facilities getting shifted there,” the CMD said."

 Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL), the entity that plans to build the world’s plant in Maharashtra, will source 30 million tonnes (mt) or half of the crude it requires, from partners Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Saudi Aramco) and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), a top official said.
Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, and ADNOC, both state-owned, will together hold a 50 per cent stake in the ₹3-lakh crore project.
Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, which together hold the balance 50 per cent stake in the 60-mt-a-year project, will also have the right of first refusal on Saudi Aramco and ADNOC’s share of products coming out of the refinery if the two decide against retailing it in India on their own and sell to customers in India or overseas, the official at one of the state-run refiners, briefed on the plan, said asking not to be named because the information is private.
“We have a commitment that we will source a maximum of 50 per cent from these two parties, but all this is subject to the grade fitting into the overall refinery configuration. The advantage with Saudi Aramco is that they have Arab Super Light to Arab Heavy and they are willing to make available anything in this range depending on the refinery configuration we chose,” he said. 
“We are talking about importing 30 mt of crude from somebody; rest of the 30 mt is still open. This big 30 mt... every month if you try to buy 1-2 mt of crude... how it is going to happen?” 
“We will decide the ratio amongst ourselves. Only then can they consider selling the products to someone else locally or taking the products out of India. Basically, we are building this refinery for India and Indians. They probably want to give us their share of the products because their initial view is not to get into retailing of products in India, maybe petrochemicals because of SABIC (Saudi Basic Industries Corp). 
“They are trying to get SABIC into the fold so that markets like India and China can be an integrated market for them,” the official, who is a director at one of the oil marketing companies, said.
Saudi Aramco is separately looking to buy a controlling stake in SABIC, one of the world’s top petrochemicals manufacturers, owned by the Saudi Arabian government.
“No Middle East company is going to participate in refinery projects without having an engagement with crude. On the other hand, if you want to make big investments today you also need to have suppliers of crude who will give you a constant source of supply of the crude you want. 
“So, if you really look at it long-term for such project of large investments, nothing is going to happen unless we have the crude supply tied-up and the product market. You know the India story, we have a big product market,” he stated."

BORL has just completed an expansion of the refinery to 7.8 million tonnes per annum




BORL has just completed an expansion of the refinery to 7.8 million tonnes per annum


New York Stock Exchange-listed US oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp is interested in picking up a stake in Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd (BORL) which runs a refinery at Bina, Madhya Pradesh as global oil producers jostle for space in India’s expanding refinery market.
Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil joins Kuwait Petroleum International, the downstream arm of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), for the stake in BORL, a joint venture of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Oman Oil Company.
BORL has just completed an expansion of the refinery to 7.8 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) from 6 mtpa. But Oman Oil did not invest in this expansion.
“We are now engaged in the blue print for doubling the capacity to 15.5 mtpa. That’s where we are talking of Kuwait Petroleum and others,” said R Ramachandran, Director (Refineries) at BPCL.
“There are plenty of players. Today, the world has changed, people are looking at India. Every Middle East country wants to come to India and see some of their crude is there with us and they want to participate in our petrochemicals. Also, other parties, very surprisingly, somebody from the west like Exxon Mobil are interested,” Ramachandran said in response to a query from BusinessLine on September 11.
Exxon Mobil could not be reached immediately for comment.
BPCL Chairman and Managing Director D Rajumar said the firm was in talks with Kuwait Petroleum and others.
“We are in talks with Kuwait Petroleum International; this is in the initial stages. It will take a while before we finalise this. Whether Kuwait Petroleum is going to be there or any other oil company is secondary, but the primary part is that we have decided to enhance the capacity of the Bina refinery to 15.5 mtpa. So, we are looking at various partners to come and join us; one such partner could be Kuwait Petroleum International,” Rajkumar said..
According to Ramachandran, Oman Oil Company has decided to continue in Bina refinery after reviewing its plans. “All the initial problems they had are behind them, they also had a big slump because the crude prices went down. Now, they are buoyed up,” he said. 
He said the gross refining margins of Bina refinery, in the last two years, were either ahead or just a few decimal points short of Reliance Industries, which runs the world’s biggest oil refinery complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat.
Gross refining margins is what a refiner earns by turning a barrel of crude oil into refined products.
Like other major producers, Exxon Mobil is looking to lock-in customers in the world’s third-largest oil consumer apart from a fuel retail play through the potential investment in the Bina Refinery, say industry sources. Kuwait Petroleum also is looking to invest in projects in return for getting an assured offtake of their crude oil.
This assumes significance as India’s energy needs are primarily met through imports, with the country importing 214 mt of crude oil in FY17."

Shares of oil marketing companies tumbled as much as 29 per cent in the morning trade as the government had on Thursday announced a lowering of excise duty by ₹1.50 a litre. 
It also asked the public sector oil marketing companies — Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation — to cut prices by ₹1 a litre. These measures will bring down petrol and diesel prices by ₹5 per litre. 
Following the announcement, shares of oil marketing companies (OMCs) lost significant ground. Brokers said the downtrend was a knee-jerk reaction. Market experts said the fuel price cut would have negative implications for upstream public sector companies.
Shares of Indian Oil Corporation opened weak at Rs 126.80, then fell further to its 52-week low of Rs 105.65, down 24.99 per cent over their previous closing price on the BSE.
Similar movement was seen on Bharat Petroleum counter as well where the stock dipped to its 52-week low of Rs 239, down 28.94 per cent on the BSE. Hindustan Petroleum also fell to its 52-week low of Rs 165.45, down 25 per cent over its last closing price.
On the NSE, too, all the three oil marketing companies fell to their 52-week low level.

 Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) on Friday said its board has approved an investment of ₹ 11,130 crore for setting up a petrochemical unit at its Kochi refinery in Kerala.
BPCL’s Kochi refinery at its recent expansion to 15.5 million tonnes per annum capacity produces 5 lakh tonnes of polymer grade propylene.
Half of this propylene is utilised for manufacturing of niche/specialty petrochemicals like acrylic acid, oxo alcohol and acrylates, which find applications in areas like paints and coatings, adhesives and solvents.
From the balance, BPCL plans to produce value added petrochemicals.
“The Board of Directors of BPCL at the meeting held on September 28 has approved the proposal for setting up facilities for production of polyols, propylene glycol and mono ethylene glycol at Kochi refinery at an estimated investment of ₹ 11,130 crore,” BPCL said in a regulatory filing.
While Polyether Polyols are used to make polyurethane foams, coatings and adhesives, Propylene Glycol is used in the manufacture of fibreglass-reinforced plastics, cosmetics, lubricants, sufactants in dyes and humectants for food products.
Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) is used in packaging, films and textile fibres.
 BPCL believes petrochemicals market in India is fast growing and profitable with open market pricing with a hedge for refining.
“Combined refinery-petrochemical complexes can be best option forv global competitive advantage, due to availability of low cost feed stock from the refinery,” it said in the project’s preliminary feasibility report.
 Currently, there is limited production of Polyols/Propylene Glycol (PG) in India due to limited availability of an important intermediate Propylene Oxide (PO), which requires Propylene feedstock.
 “The niche propylene derivatives petrochemical project offers an attractive opportunity for BPCL for utilising the balance polymer grade propylene feedstock from Kochi facility to meet this demand for niche petrochemicals,” it said. “The proposed project will be a self contained facility and will be set up contiguous to the Kochi Refinery of BPCL, in order to achieve synergies of integration with feedstock source, a vital element in the success of a project”."
57,2018-10-14,BPCL,"Oil marketing companies: Value in the pipeline
The stocks of the public sector oil-marketing companies (OMCs) — Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL — were hammered down 25-35 per cent in just two trading sessions on October 4 and 5. This sucker punch was the market’s strong show of disapproval to the Centre’s move to force these companies to take price cuts of ₹1 per litre on petrol and diesel as part of the price relief package for customers. 
On its part, the Centre cut excise duty on these fuels by ₹1.5 per litre, and the Finance Minister urged States to reduce sales/value-added tax (VAT) by ₹2.5 a litre to bring the total relief to ₹5 a litre. 
Rapidly rising global crude-oil prices, the rupee’s rout, and high excise duty and VAT, combined together, were propelling petrol and diesel prices to all-time highs on a daily basis. With customers getting increasing restive, the Centre, under pressure, finally cut excise duties after holding out for a long time. In the process, it also made the oil companies sacrifice.
While customers were somewhat relieved, the market voted with its feet at the forced co-option of the OMCs in the cost cuts. There is a strong fear that this move signals the end of fuel-price deregulation — the key reform that was instrumental in improving the fortunes of the OMCs over the past few years. Petrol pricing was decontrolled in 2010, and that of diesel in 2014. While the Finance Minister has stated that pricing of the fuels remains deregulated and that the OMCs could continue to adjust prices with market movements, the market seems unconvinced.
That’s because a pattern has emerged of the OMCs capitulating to the diktats of the government — their major shareholder — and losing their pricing freedom on petrol and diesel in the poll season — the companies go slow or temporarily freeze price hikes altogether. 
This happened during the run-up to the Gujarat elections last Decemberm and repeated itself prior to the Karnataka elections in May. As a result, the marketing margins of the OMCs took a sharp knock. But when the poll season was behind them, the oil firms made up the lost ground by hiking prices; marketing margins went up again.
The market has been worried whether this recoup-after-elections phenomenon will be possible in the coming months, with an intense election cycle on the cards. 
Elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Mizoram and Chhattisgarh are lined up for the end of the year and the Lok Sabha elections is likely to be held sometime in April. Even before the latest rout, the OMC stocks had been big losers — losing 30-50 per cent over a year.
The latest arm-twisting of the OMCs by the Centre only adds to the apprehensions of the market. There is continued uncertainty about the trajectory of both oil and the rupee, and the Centre’s financial position is tight. There are worries that in the event oil prices again rise sharply or the rupee’s rout continues, the OMCs will be again told to cut fuel prices. The stocks’ recent crash has more to do with seriously soured sentiments than the financial impact of the ₹1-per-litre cut. In all, after a strong run from 2013-end until last year, the OMC stocks have shed about 40-55 per cent or more over the past year or so. 
Valuations are also down sharply. The Indian Oil stock now trades at about fives times trailing 12-month earnings, compared with the three-year average of 10 times. Similarly, the stocks of HPCL and BPCL are trading at about four times and 5.5 times, much lower than their three-year averages of about 8.5 times and 12 times. The stocks seem to have been de-rated on the concerns about the lack of pricing freedom.
Does this sharp fall present a buying opportunity? Maybe, but only if you have a stomach for high risks and a long-term horizon. There is danger — in the short-term, at least — that the OMCs may again be made patsy to keep petrol and diesel prices under check. But on the other hand, there are certain factors that make for an investment case now.
One, heavy value-destruction in the OMC stocks harms their major shareholder — the Centre — too, and could sharply reduce the latter’s inflows in the future when it may seek to divest stakes in these companies. 
The Centre will hopefully take lessons from the recent carnage and become more creative in the future when it comes to price cuts. It could direct the OMCs — arguably, still in good financial health — to pay higher dividends, and cut excise duties from these proceeds, instead of asking the OMCs to cut prices on their own. If this were done, the monetary implications for the Centre will largely be the same, but the market sentiment for the OMC stocks could improve. 
Next, coming to dividends, the OMC stocks are likely to continue paying healthy dividends, come rain or shine. Over the past three fiscal years, the dividend per share has been ₹14-35. The combination of high dividends and stock price decline translates into high dividend yields. After the recent crash, the dividend yield is 7-8 per cent for these three stocks. 
Finally, despite the pulls and pressures, earnings growth has remained healthy for the OMCs, aided by expansions and inventory gains. While the price freezes and cuts will have some impact, earnings should continue growing at a good pace over the long run, with the companies expanding and upgrading their capacities. Besides, it is unlikely that the government will completely roll back the pricing reforms that had ushered in huge positive change over the past few years. It is likely that, in less than a year, when the election dust settles, true pricing freedom will be restored to the OMCs."

Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited’s (BPCL) Kochi Refinery received the first parcel of its crude oil, marking a step towards enhancing the country’s energy security.
The parcel is part of the equity crude oil cargo of Bharat Petro Resources Limited (BPRL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPCL, which aims to provide partial supply security of crude and hedging of price risks.
This is the first delivery of BPRL to the parent company.
At a function at the control room of BPCL shore tank farm at Puthuvypeen, M Beena, Chairperson, Cochin Port Trust switched on the pumping of the BPCL Own Crude Oil in the presence of Ajay Kumar, Managing Director, BPRL and Prasad K Panicker, Executive Director (Kochi Refinery).

The investment will be BPCL’s largest in an upstream project overseas
   -  B_JOTHI RAMALINGAM


State-run Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) will invest as much as $800 million as equity in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique where it holds a 10 per cent stake, as the project moves closer to the final investment decision (FID) stage. This will be BPCL’s largest investment in an upstream project overseas.
The Maharatna PSU paid $703 million ($800 million is over and above this) to buy the 10 per cent participating interest in the Rovuma Offshore Area 1 concession in the Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique where about 75 trillion cubic feet of natural gas was discovered, positioning it as a strategic global LNG supplier.
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, USA is the main operator of the gas field with a 26.5 per cent participating interest. The Area 1 consortium is developing an initial onshore LNG project consisting of two LNG trains with total nameplate capacity of 12.88 million tonnes per annum (mtpa).
To reach the FID stage, three major milestones have to be achieved. First, is to have a reasonably stable and robust contractual and fiscal framework with the Mozambique government. Second, the consortium has to sign long-term LNG sale and purchase agreements (SPA) for at least 9 mtpa to facilitate debt for the project and the third is the funding for the project.
The partnership has concluded the legal and contractual framework with the signing of the marine concession agreements with the Mozambique government. It has signed long-term SPAs for 1.2 mtpa of LNG and is in advanced negotiations with several buyers, including BPCL, to secure the remaining volume of 9 mtpa to reach FID.
Currently, the partners are discussing the terms and conditions of project funding which will largely depend on the quantity and rate at which the gas is sold. The entire 9 mtpa is expected to be tied-up by the end of the year or early next year.
“Assuming that the project cost is going to be somewhere around $20 billion, we are anticipating that 33-37 per cent will be equity and the balance would be debt. Once, that is finalised, we are good to reach the FID stage. We are hoping that the FID will happen sometime next year in the first half or second half,” a BPCL executive said.
Out of the $20-billion project cost, BPCL will have to contribute equity of some $800 million as its share of the 10 per cent participating interest when the FID is closed, he said.
Bharat PetroResources Ltd, the upstream unit of BPCL, holds participating interest in 12 oil and gas blocks overseas in Russia, Brazil, Mozambique, UAE, Indonesia, Australia, Israel and Timor Leste.
BPCL said it did not pay any “premium” to acquire the 10 per cent participating interest in the Mozambique LNG project. “We got in at the ground level and hence did not pay any premium for picking up the 10 per cent interest,” the executive said."

Shares of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd fell as much as 4.2 per cent to Rs 265.75, lowest in a week, as the company’s Q2 profit missed estimates. The stock was the top percentage loser on NSE index.
The company’s September-quarter profit nearly halved to Rs 1,219 crore ($165.66 million), well below analysts' expectations, due to higher expenses on account of forex losses. Average gross refining margin fell to $5.57 per barrel from $7.97 per barrel a year earlier, the company had said on Monday.
Citi analysts say Q3 refining performance will be key to watch out for given the likely lack of inventory gains and as Singapore GRMs are also under pressure. It has maintained a price target of Rs 260, and 'sell' rating.
According to Motilal Oswal analysts, key risk for the company “would be sharing of subsidy burden on LPG/kerosene and inability to pass on the increased cost in auto fuels”. More than 2.6 million shares traded as of 0411 GMT, 0.3 times their 10-day average of 10 million shares."

 The expansion of the network is being undertaken by state run OMCs including Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and the ONGC-run Hindustan Petroleum. This will cover around 80 per cent of the total locations.
“For a fast growing economy like ours, energy needs are growing manifold and state run OMCs are undertaking retail network expansion in tandem with the growth in demand of petrol and diesel,” an IOCL official Parth Vora told reporters here.
 Today, around 55,000 fuel pumps are run by OMCs, of which nearly 50 per cent belongs to IOCL. Among the private players, Nyara Energy (formerly Essar Oil) runs more than 3,500 fuel pumps and Reliance has around 600 pumps, while other foreign players such as BP and Shell runs 100 pumps each.
 According to statistics, retail sales of petrol and diesel are increasing at the rate of 8 per cent and 4 per cent per annum, respectively.
 Vora further said applications for 55,649 outlets have been issued.
“This expansion has been undertaken to meet the growing fuel needs and convenience of customers in emerging markets like the upcoming highways, agricultural pockets and industrial hubs,” he said.
 The retail outlet network in rural, remote and far flung areas are also expanded with the intention of reaching the product, ensuring quality and correct price to meet the rural agricultural demand and people living in remote areas, Vora added. These new outlets will be opened through the next three years."

 Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have an ambitious plan to open nearly 4,500 fuel outlets across Gujarat, an official said on Saturday.
Talking to reporters here, Indian Oil Chief Regional Manager Sunil Vikramsingh said, “To meet the increasing requirements of customers on highways, agricultural sector products and industries, it was observed necessary to open such fuel outlets in the state.” 
“IOCL, BPCL and HPCL have an ambitious plan to open nearly 4,500 fuel outlets in the state,” he said. About 3 to 4 fuel outlets will be opened near the Statue of Unity, dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and the world’s tallest statue, at Kevadiya in neighbouring Narmada district, he added.
 More than three lakh visitors have already visited the site. Therefore, opening of three to four fuel outlets will help the tourists, the official said. The OMCs (oil marketing companies) plan to expand in tier II and III cities as well as rural areas, interior areas and remote areas as they lack presence in these geographies.
 The Indian Oil will set up 128 retail outlets, with Bharat Petroleum 50 and Hindustan Petroleum 49 in Vadodara district of Gujarat. “All these OMCs are set to expand their fuel retail network after a gap of nearly four years, which is due to eight per cent annual growth in sale of petrol and four per cent in diesel,” Vikramsingh said. The OMCs have formally announced their plans and bidding process for inviting tenders has also started, he said, adding that each fuel outlet will cost between Rs 60 lakh to Rs 3 crore depending on their location.
 “The OMCs for the first time have come together to work on such a scale to avoid duplication and eating into each other’s business,” he added. Retail outlets opened after 2014 were largely through the revival of old stations or restoration of dealerships that had been terminated because of non-performance since 2005. Under the new dealership guidelines, the educational qualification for a dealer has been lowered to Class X pass from the previous requirement of being a graduate and the upper age limit has been raised to 60 years from 45."

Subsequent to the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) scheme, LPG penetration in Karnataka has increased from 68.49 per cent in June 2014 to 96.75 per cent in December 2018.
“The number of LPG customers stood at 95.83 lakh as on June 1, 2014. It stood at 143.20 lakh as on December 1, 2018, which is an increase of 47.87 lakh in the last four years. Under the PMUY, 18.03 lakh connections have been released in Karnataka up to November 2018. Of this, Indian Oil Corporation accounted for 8 lakh connections, Bharat Petroleum Corporation 4.58 lakh and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation 5.4 lakh,” said D. L. Pramodh, Executive Director, Indian Oil Corporation, and state-level co-ordinator for the oil industry in Karnataka.
According to Census 2011, Karnataka had 133.55 lakh households and as per decadal growth, the number of households would be 48.01 lakh currently. Of these, the number of active customers would be 143.2 lakh, accounting for 96.75 per cent LPG coverage in the state.
To expand LPG coverage further, the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan was launched during June to August 2018, wherein LPG Panachayats were conducted throughout the state.
“A total of 1,440 villages in Karnataka were identified as having low LPG penetration. We are targeting them by initially releasing 2 lakh connections to the eligible beneficiaries,” said Pramodh.
The Extended Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana-2 (EPMUY) scheme has been approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA). In this scheme, BPL households not covered under the SECC data and EPMUY would be facilitated to avail of the PMUY LPG connection. “This scheme will lead to near 100 per cent LPG penetration in Karnataka, by releasing LPG connections to the poor adult women in rural households,” explained Pramodh.
Another one crore LPG connection are expected to be released across the country during the period January to April 2019."

 State-run oil refiner Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) is close to getting cabinet backing to expand the capacity of its refinery located at Numaligarh in Assam’s Golaghat district by 6 million tonnes with an investment of ₹22,000 crore. The Narendra Modi-led government is expected to sign off on the expansion plan that includes a viability gap funding (VGF) and tax concessions from the Centre as the ruling party pushes ahead with its aim to woo voters in the North-East with mega projects in the run-up to the general elections. 
North-East States send 25 lawmakers to Lok Sabha.
Numaligarh Refinery Ltd, 61.65 per cent owned by Maharatna PSU BPCL, currently refines 3 mt of crude a year. The refinery was set up in 1999 following the Assam Accord.
Oil India Ltd holds a 26 per cent stake in the refinery with the Assam government holding the balance equity. The joint venture partners are treating the expansion as a separate project having a different configuration from the existing refinery, a government official said. “The proposal has secured full support of the Petroleum and Finance ministries. So, the cabinet approval is a mere formality. Since it is a project in the North-East, there will be a lot of push from the government,” the government official said. BPCL confirmed the plan.
Oil refiners are facing difficulties in supporting demand in the North-East where the growth has outstripped other regions. “Because, the growth is so fast in the North-East, we were trying to expand capacity to ease the market,” the official said. The refinery will also supply products to Bangladesh.
Maharatna PSU Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), meanwhile, will raise the capacity of the LPG bottling plant at its Bongaigaon Refinery, also in Assam, chairman Sanjiv Singh said on Saturday. The enhanced LPG production capacity at the refinery will be commissioned this year, he said, adding this will increase the LPG production in the North-East five times. 
 LPG production capacity is being raised as part of modification work that will hike the refinery’s capacity marginally to 2.75 mt from 2.35 mt. “The next expansion of Bongaigaon refinery to 4.5 mt is linked to the new crude pipeline Numaligarh refinery will lay for its expansion, because there is no crude in that region to support the expansion. When Numaligarh lays the new pipeline from Paradip to its refinery for its expansion, all these refineries will get connected,” Sanjiv Singh said.
The shipping ministry, meanwhile, has submitted a proposal to the finance ministry for augmentation of navigation capacity of national waterway 2 (NW-2 on river Brahmaputra) in Assam with technical and financial assistance from the World Bank, on the lines of the Jal Marg Vikas project on NW-1. 
A scoping mission of the World Bank visited NW-2 and NW-16 (also in Assam) during December 10-14, 2018, according to a ministry document. BusinessLine reported this development on December 18, saying the World Bank was looking to lend more than $100 million to the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) for developing NW-2."

BPCL-Kochi Refinery is going ahead with its second petrochemical project to produce polyols at an investment of ₹11,300 crore. An import substitute, polyols are used in the production of polyurethanes used in diverse products such as automotive seats, mattresses and shoe soles.
The project is expected to go on stream by 2022, said Prasad K Panicker, the company’s Executive Director. BPCL is in talks with various global firms to finalise the technology for six different products. There is a huge demand for polyols and it is growing at 10 per cent per annum providing good scope for MSMEs to set up units in the complex, he added.
The first petrochemical project of BPCL-KR constructed at a cost of ₹5,500 crore is all set to commence operations by the middle of the year. It will produce acrylic acid, acrylates and oxo-alcohol that are used in the manufacture of paints, super absorbent polymers, detergents, adhesives, sealants and solvents. The technology has been sourced from Mitsubishi, Air Liquide Global and Johnson Mathey Davy.
The two projects will facilitate ₹13,000 crore forex savings per annum for the country.
With the completion of the second petrochemical project, BPCL-KR is expecting around 16 per cent increase in its turnover in three years. “We expect the turnover to increase by ₹10,000 crore to ₹70,000 crore by 2022 at the current level of prices,” Panicker said.
BPCL-KR is slated to complete its fuel upgradation project to comply with BS-VI norms by February next year. The project cost is around ₹3,300 crore."

 Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd has sold naphtha cargo out of Kochi for the first time this year after cancelling two earlier sales tenders, industry sources said on Monday.
BPCL sold 35,000 tonnes of naphtha for May 2-3 loading from Kochi to Japanese trader Petro-Diamond at a premium of about $16 a tonne to its own price formula on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.
It skipped exporting the fuel from Kochi for January and April 2019 loading and cancelled sales tenders for February and March cargoes. BPCL also exports naphtha from Mumbai.
Indian naphtha exports have been low this year due to domestic demand and India's refineries either undertaking maintenance or upgrading their facilities to prepare for Euro VI-compliant fuels.
India's February 2019 naphtha exports came in at 4,30,000 tonnes, according to official data, the lowest monthly exports since October 2015."

 Indian refiners are increasing their planned purchases from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Mexico and the United States (US) to make up for any loss of Iranian oil, sources and company officials said.
All four Indian state-owned refiners that buy Iranian oil are confident of securing additional barrels from other producers, officials from the companies said.
The state refiners have not yet placed orders for Iranian oil for May, when the current waiver expires, pending clarity from the US.
Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) have tapped Iraq to make up for Iranian oil, while Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has signed its first annual contract with US suppliers and raised supplies from Mexico.
“There will be no supply constraints. The supply can come from both OPEC and non-OPEC nations like the US,” said MK Surana, chairman of Hindustan Petroleum Corp, which purchased up to 1.5 million tonnes per year of Iranian crude in 2018/19.
The OPEC and other producers including Russia have gradually tightened supply through 2019 to reduce a global glut. OPEC and its partners may not renew the curbs when they expire after June because of the risk of over-tightening the market.
IOC, Iran's biggest Indian client, will cut Iranian oil imports to six million tonnes, or about 120,000 barrels per day, in the 2019/20 period from nine million in 2018/19. It has also raised the optional volumes it can buy from other producers to two million tonnes, a company official said.
“Our optional quantities under term deals are higher than last year. We have optional contracts with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other suppliers. They will supply more if we want,” the official said, adding his firm would also buy more US oil if required.
IOC also hopes to buy 1.5 million tonnes of Mexican oil in 2019, compared with 1 million tonnes last year, the source said.
Officials from state-owned National Iranian Oil Co did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the Indian refiners' plans to purchase less Iranian crude.
Refinery officials said their 2019/20 crude import strategy was not contingent on Iranian oil, and was more flexible than in previous years.
“We don't have a watertight plan for the year, we have optional quantities so that it is possible to find replacement if any country goes out for any reason,” said an MRPL official.
During previous sanctions against Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq raised supplies to India to grow market share in the country, the world's third-biggest oil consumer and importer.
Last year, MRPL signed its first annual deal with Iraq to buy 1.5 million tonnes of Basra oil in 2019.
BPCL has signed a deal to buy 5 million tonnes of Iraqi oil in 2019 compared with 1.5 million tonnes in 2018, its head of refineries R Ramachandran said, adding his company is considering buying more oil from South America.
BPCL recently bought Brazilian crude and plans to buy Mexican oil as well, he said.
“We have a strategy with and without Iran,” he added."

IndianOil , Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) will be laying the world’s longest LPG pipeline, from Kandla (Gujarat) to Gorakhpur (UP). An IndianOil statement said the 2,757-km cross-country pipeline will connect three major States — Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh — to the western coast and reach LPG to 22 bottling plants (BPs) of the three oil marketing companies (OMCs).
A joint venture agreement to this effect was signed here on Monday evening.
The Kandla-Gorakhpur LPG pipeline is estimated to cost about ₹10,000 crore. It will be implemented through a joint venture company where IndianOil will hold 50 per cent and the other two OMCs will hold 25 per cent each.
“The pipeline will source LPG from three import terminals on the west coast and two refineries (at Koyali and Bina) and supply it to 22 bottling plants of the three OMCs connected en route — three in Gujarat, six in Madhya Pradesh and 13 in Uttar Pradesh,” an official statement said.
In addition, the pipeline will supply LPG to 21 more bottling plants in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh through road-bridging.
Once completed, the single pipeline can transport up to 8.25 million tonnes of LPG per year, which amounts to about 25 per cent of India’s LPG demand, the statement added."

The investment will be BPCL’s largest in an upstream project overseas B_JOTHI RAMALINGAM




State-run oil refiner Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) will borrow as much as Rs 70,000 crore by 2024 to part-fund a Rs 1,10,000-crore expansion to bolster its refining and marketing infrastructure, raise petrochemical capacity, invest in upstream and gas ventures, the company’s finance director N Vijayagopal, has said.
Three-fourths of the borrowing will be in dollars and the balance is rupees, in line with BPCL’s policy of raising as much as 75 per cent of its requirements – short and long-term - in foreign currency, due to the attractive rates and the natural hedge it offers as the firm sells products that are essentially linked to dollar prices.
The capex will also be used to part-fund equity infusion of as much as Rs 10,000 crore over the next five years in Bharat Petro Resources Ltd (BRPL) to help the wholly-owned upstream unit, invest some $2.5 billion in the LNG project in Mozambique, where it has a 10 per cent participating interest.
“We have to invest Rs 10,000 crore in the equity of BPRL over the next five years, about Rs 2,000 crore will go each year to BPRL, depending on the progress of the Mozambique LNG project,” Vijayagopal said on the sidelines of a media conference on Friday.
The company will fund this year’s capex of Rs 7,800 crore mostly from internal resources. 
Debt is not a problem for BPCL, the finance director said. “We are a very low geared company. Our debt is 0.7:1 today at a stand-alone level and 1:1 at a consolidated level. After the Rs 1.1 lakh crore expansion, at the consolidated level, the debt-equity ratio will be 1.5:1, which is very comfortable. Currently, the total debt on our book will be around Rs 25,000 crore, including working capital. We don’t believe in zero debt, it’s a myth,” Vijayagopal said.
Bharat Gas Resources Ltd (BGRL), another wholly-owned unit of BPCL, has signed a Sales and Purchase Agreement to source 1 million tonnes (mt) of LNG a year for 15 years from the Mozambique LNG project, and the supplies are expected to start from 2024-25.

   -  The Hindu


 
Petronet LNG Ltd (PLL), India’s biggest importer of liquefied natural gas(LNG), will take a 26 per cent stake in a planned 1 million tonne (mt) capacity terminal for import and re-gasification of the super cooled fuel. This terminal will be helmed by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) at Krishnapatnam port in Andhra Pradesh’s Nellore district.
BPCL has received the board’s approval for the project, which is estimated to cost some Rs 1,700 crore and is targeted for operations by 2024.
“We have an arrangement for PLL to take a 26 per cent stake in the project,” a top BPCL executive told BusinessLine. “We are also talking to Japanese firms such as Mitsui & Co and NKK as well as some other firms to take stakes in the terminal,” the executive said, asking not to be named.
PLL, part-owned by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd, GAIL (India) Ltd, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd and BPCL, runs LNG regasification terminals at Dahej in Gujarat and Kochi in Kerala.
BPCL’s decision to build the terminal at Krishnapatnam port was dictated by the need for such facilities on the Eastern coast to tap demand for the clean fuel in the Southern and Eastern parts of the country.
Most of the LNG regasification terminals are currently located on the country’s Western coast.
D Rajkumar, Chairman and Managing Director of BPCL said that the project was “first of its kind in India”.
“The uniqueness of this project is that we are not looking at 3 mt or 5 mt or 7.5 mt in the initial stage itself. But, depending on the demand, we will be scaling up the project. We are starting with 1 mt and go to 3 mt and then to 5 mt depending on the demand so that we don’t land-up in a situation where the utilization of the terminal is very low like unfortunately what is happening with the Kochi LNG terminal,” Rajkumar said.
“We are not looking at a floating storage re-gasification unit (FSRU) or land-based terminal, we are looking at a floating storage unit (FSU) and then regasification on land; this is being used in other parts of the world, so we thought of doing this mainly to reduce project cost in the initial stages,” he added.
“BPCL is trying to be cautious on the capacity and the investment it will make in the project. Instead of making a Rs 6,000 crore investment upfront, we are starting small,” the BPCL executive mentioned earlier said.
The oil refiner is also scouting for a captive customer for the terminal. “Besides, we are thinking that our terminal can also look at feeding some other markets that will come up such as the city gas distribution (CGD) in that region, Hyderabad and around and Eastern India,” he added.
CGD will happen in the Eastern region, but they will not have any gas feed, as all re-gasification terminals are on the West. “In the West, pipelines will come, but the East market is going to suffer. The success of CGD in the East will depend on the ability to have products being made available there. Plus, we are also anticipating that Mozambique will start giving gas and we will have our own gas,” the BPCL executive said.
Bharat Gas Resources Ltd (BGRL), the gas unit of BPCL, has signed a Sales and Purchase Agreement, to source 1 mt of LNG a year for 15 years from the Mozambique LNG project, and the supplies are expected to start from 2024-25.
BGRL is looking to double its gas business to 5 mt by 2022 from 1.8 mt, Rajkumar said. It has acquired 13 geographical areas (GA) in the Ninth and Tenth rounds of bidding for CGD networks. The firm is targeting a portfolio of 37 GA’s, he added."

 State-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) will invest about ₹25,000 crore to set up an ethylene cracker plant at Rasayani, 50 kilometres from its Mumbai refinery, as the firm pushes further into the petrochemicals business to fuel growth.
The share of petrochemicals in BPCL’s portfolio is currently “around 1per cent” as the refiner mostly focussed on transportation fuels so far. But, with electric vehicles coming in, the firm reckons that “it is likely to have some impact on transportation fuels”.
“We are now thinking of diversifying more into petrochemicals. Our plan is to move from 1 per cent to 10 per cent and, if possible, go up to 15 per cent. This is what the existing configuration of our refineries will allow us. The existing configuration cannot be tweaked to a large extent to achieve higher percentage of petrochemicals unlike a new refinery,” D Rajkumar, BPCL’s Chairman and Managing Director, said.
India’s second biggest fuel retailer is currently in the midst of modernising its Mumbai refinery and shifting some of its non-process related facilities such as the LPG and POL plants to Rasayani, where it is buying land from Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd (HOC) to set up these units.
“The main thing for Rasayani is petrochemicals which will be done in two phases. In the first phase, we will put up the LPG and POL plants and replace the old Catalytic Cracking Unit (CCU) and Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) with a modern Petro Resid Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Unit (PRFCC), which will produce Propylene,” R Ramachandran, director (refineries), BPCL, said.
Propylene is used as a feedstock for making Polypropylene — a polymer used in industrial applications such as packaging, plastics, textiles, living hinges and the automobile industry.
The LPG and the POL plants will cost about ₹2,000 crore and the Polypropylene plant will be about ₹4,500 crore. 
“We are not stopping there. We have in mind a second phase which mainly involve setting up an Ethylene cracker plant that is also connected to the refinery which will require an investment of about Rs 25,000 crore. We are planning for that two years from now. We have a first stage clearance from the board for the Ethylene cracker plant and we are starting a feasibility study on that,” Ramachandran said.
BPCL is looking to buy some 1,000 acres of land from HOC for the Rasayani facility. It has an arrangement with HOC for taking 684 acres, of which 243 acres is in its possession to be used for the LPG and POL plants, while the balance is in the process of being acquired, Ramachandran said adding that the company was “buying extra land to build the Ethylene cracker unit”. 
It has also bought some land at Chembur, close to its refinery.
The refiner is looking to cut down the truck movement to and from the Mumbai refinery by shifting some of the non-process related facilities to Rasayani with the aim of reducing pollution.“In the de-bottlenecking from Chembur (where the Mumbai refinery is located) to Rasayani, we had estimated a reduction of 150 trucks per day initially. But, after buying more land at Chembur, we may further reduce some 40 trucks per day. So, totally we expect a reduction of 150-200 trucks per day which is a significant number,” Ramachandran said.
BPCL will commission its ₹5,236 crore Propylene Derivative Petrochemical Project (PDPP) at Kochi refinery for manufacturing niche petrochemicals in the next six months.

Media reports suggests that the government is looking to divest its 53.29 per cent stake in BPCL to IOCL or even private players. BPCL is the second largest oil marketing company (OMC) after IOCL and is one of the best managed PSU with presence across refining (33.2 mtpa or 13 per cent of Indian refining), fuel retailing (14,977 stations or 23 per cent of total outlets), E&P stakes in Mozambique, Brazil, Russia, etc, along with city gas distribution (CGD) stake in 17 geographical areas. Besides, BPCL is one of the promoters of IGL, Petronet, etc. In this note, we look at various scenarios in terms of ownership change and its impact on competition landscape of India.
We believe divestment of BPCL to private sector will help maximize revenue for the government (₹84,700 crore). Divestment to IOCL will create a behemoth although it is unlikely to alter market dynamics in the near term. While divestment to IOCL is the easy way out, real price discovery of BPCL will happen with stake sale to foreign/private players. Sale to IOCL will attract reasonable premium as HPCL transaction was done at about 18 per cent premium. We remain constructive on OMCs as they are well placed to benefit from benign crude oil prices and GRM improvement from IMO 2020 implementation. Reiterate BUY."

The stock of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), after surging from ₹329.3 to ₹408.5 in last three weeks posted a strong gain of 24 per cent. However, this week the stock is witnessing huge selling pressure as crude oil price flared up due to geopolitical tensions in the middle east that happened over the weekend.
On Monday, BPCL opened lower at ₹388 against previous close at ₹408.5 and closed the session at an even lower level of ₹380, declining by 7 per cent. Volatility in crude oil price is expected to keep the stock price under pressure, whereas in today’s session also the stock price depreciated after opening at ₹379.9 and is currently trading at ₹371 levels.
Crude oil price will most likely stay at elevated levels and as a result the stock price of BPCL might be get dragged to lower levels. Hence, traders with short-term perspective can sell the stock with stop loss at ₹377 and look for a target of ₹363.

The week beginning Monday could demonstrate whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the political will to privatise big state-run firms, an area that has remained untouched by his bold, yet often controversial decision-making prowess.
During his first term and since retaining power in the May polls with an even bigger majority, Modi has steered clear of the politically-sensitive issue, but a stiff target of ₹1,05,000 crore set by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on disinvestment revenue for FY20 could leave him with little options, say sources. Modi’s economic policy managers will place before his Cabinet a list of firms that they say could potentially be sold to private firms.
The list includes oil refiner Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd; rail-hauler Container Corporation of India Ltd (CONCOR); ocean carrier Shipping Corporation of India Ltd (SCI); and two power producers, THDC India Ltd and NEEPCO, according to government sources.
BPCL is a maharatna PSU, while Concor and SCI are navratna PSUs. THDC and NEEPCO are mini-ratna PSUs.
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) is seeking clarity from the Cabinet on the way forward. “These companies are part of the list being considered for strategic disinvestment. The decision whether to strategically disinvest and if so whether it should be in favour of a private entity or another public sector undertaking is a call the Cabinet has to take,” said a government official briefed on the plan, asking not to be named.
“We are hoping to get a clarity in the coming week,” he said, adding that “consolidation of PSUs will continue”.
The timing could not have been better. The corporate tax cuts announced by the Finance Minister a few days go has buoyed capital markets, improving the valuations of these state-run firms, which may fetch higher prices during the sale.
Market sources said that these five firms could fetch as much as ₹75,000 crore to the government. If Modi chooses to tread a “safe path” on strategic disinvestment, then BPCL could probably be sold to Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), while THDC and NEEPCO may be acquired by some other power PSUs.
That leavesCONCOR and SCI, both of which do not have other PSUs that could benefit from synergies arising from buying them, except may be for a state-owned oil refiner that could be interested in the crude oil and product tankers of SCI.
“CONCOR and SCI are, hence, ideal candidates for privatisation,” says an industry source.
The sale of CONCOR could benefit from India’s focus on logistics play to cut transportation costs. Besides, both CONCOR and SCI are operating in an industry that is undergoing rapid transformation due to technological disruptions and new global regulations, particularly in shipping, to counter climate change. The down-side of not investing in technology, at least for SCI, could be huge.
“Their debt positions are comfortable, though SCI has borne the brunt of the global slowdown since 2008, reporting losses in many of the years since then unlike its private rivals, both local and global, mainly due to the inflexibilities associated with running a government-managed shipping company.
“The time is ripe to privatise SCI, lest it becomes another Air India or BSNL,” the industry source said, adding that retaining SCI, under government-control for “strategic reasons”, has lost its relevance as a large portion of India’s crude imports are shipped on foreign-flagged ships at competitive rates.
Workforce may not be a cause for concern while deciding on the sale of CONCOR and SCI. CONCOR has about 1,500 full-time employees and another 25 on deputation from the Railway Ministry, while whereas SCI has about 650 full-time on-shore employees and more than 3,000 employed on board ships, a good portion of them on contract.
BPCL, on the other hand, has more than 12,000 employees and could be a worry for Modi, given the grim unemployment scenario in the country, the industry source added."
29,2019-10-01,BPCL,"Can BPCL attract Exxon’s of the world? 


Whether the likes of ExxonMobil throw their hat in to participate in the Indian government’s ambitious strategic sale proposal of oil refining-cum-retailing public sector entity Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) remains to be seen.
A section of industry feels that there is a strong change of Americans looking at India’s energy space more diligently following the “Howdy Modi” success and the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s separate interaction with the CEOs from the US oil and gas sectors. However, there are those who feel that interests could come in from friends like – Saudi Aramco or Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.
It is anyone’s guess now with the core group of secretaries on divestment (CGD) reportedly having cleared a proposal on privatisation of five PSUs including BPCL. According to reports, the proposal was for the strategic sale of entire 53.29 per cent stake of the Government of India (GoI) in BPCL to the private sector. Depending on the competitive intensity during bidding, likely proceeds for the government could be in the range of Rs 60,000 crore -- Rs 70,000 crore at the full stake sale, according to industry.
“In my personal view, the government should get out of BPCL completely by selling maximum possible shares to the public and others. BPCL is among the best public sector enterprises in the country, thanks to its history and DNA. It may not be a bad idea to hive off its refinining and overseas businesses into two separate entitities before selling for the purpose of maximising returns,” said Narendra Taneja, Energy Expert.
He, however, is quick to add that “Indian Oil and ONGC must remain under the government’s full control to take care of the country’s downstream and upstream energy security, but divesting the state stake in other oil companies aggessively makes loads of sense”.
“Similarly, the government must maintain the full control in the GAIL India Ltd for the purpose of the country’s natural gas security. The coming three decades belong to natural gas,” Taneja feels.
K. Ravichandran, Senior Vice President, Group Head-Corporate Ratings, ICRA Ltd , “From the government perspective, it would make eminent sense to disinvest, as it’s likely to command a premium over the prevailing market capitalisation, given the potential for value unlocking from the current businesses and control premium. Moreover, despite losing one oil marketing company (OMC), it will have control over two PSU OMCs, if it wants to have some say on the pricing of sensitive petroleum products when international oil prices stay elevated.”
Also, the purported disinvestment will heighten the competitive dynamic for fuel marketing in India, which will be a positive for retail and bulk consumers, he said adding “In the current environment, despite the presence of few private sector/multi national companies, the market is dominated by PSUs.”
Despite deregulation of most of the petroleum products, PSUs rule the roost given their access to massive infrastructure as regards pipelines, depots, ATF dispensing and retail outlets, he elaborated adding “Moreover, private sector is concerned about the policy certainty with regard to pricing freedom on auto fuels – motor spirit and high speed diesel. With a higher share of private sector in marketing, the latter will be more emboldened to invest further in the sector.”"

CMP: ₹492.75
Target: ₹450
We maintain our cautious stance on BPCL following the recent run up in the stock. Despite the structural implications of about 13 per cent of Indian refining and about 25 per cent of Indian marketing capacity potentially being owned by a private player, we submit that the stock already prices in close to a bull case scenario for BPCL, leaving little on the table for investors. Additionally, with higher capex in prospect, BPCL also faces significant credit rating downgrades due to losing the implicit government support on balance sheet, raising credit cost. Pending clarity on valuation and actual interest from potential buyers, we downgrade to REDUCE.
While our base case target price of ₹450/share implies a 8.2 per cent downside from CMP, even factoring in more optimistic assumptions for GRMs ($6.4/bbl vs $5.9/bbl in base

27,2019-10-10,BPCL,"BPCL Kochi Refinery’s petrochem project to produce niche products, help reduce imports


BPCL Kochi Refinery is set to enter its next development phase of being an integrated refinery-cum-petrochemical unit with its ₹5,246-crore Propylene Derivatives Petrochemical Project (PDPP) getting ready for commissioning shortly. 
Upon the project’s commissioning, the Kochi Refinery will become the first Indian refinery to produce niche petrochemicals that are being imported in large quantities. The PDPP project will help Kochi Refinery to produce Acrylates, Acrylic Acid and Oxo-Acohol, Prasad K.Panicker, Executive Director, told reporters. 
 The project will help reduce imports of niche petrochemical products and lead to savings of ₹4,500 crore per year. 
Acrylic acid will be the first product that be made available in December and the company has set up the largest single train unit in the world with a capacity of 160 KTPA, the first of its kind in India. The product will find takers in industries such as paints, coatings, adhesives, water treatment and solvents. 
 At present, acrylic acid is being imported at a cost of $1400 a tonne. With the commissioning of the project, the company is likely to cater to 75 per cent of the domestic demand and the price would come down at $1000 per tonne. The company's marketing team has already started discussions with industrial units in South India to ensure the availability of the product locally, he said adding that the project will attract many ancillary industries to Kochi. 
The Oxo-Alcohol unit with a capacity of 212 KTPA is the largest and the second such unit. With the availability of products from PDPP and the coming petrochemical ventures of BPCL, the Kerala Government plans to set up a petrochemical park in the vicinity. 
The company had embarked on petrochemical ventures following the recent expansion and modernisation of the refinery at a cost of ₹16,500 crore. This was made possible through Integrated Refinery Expansion Project (IREP). Strategically, IREP units are configured to produce half a million tonnes of propylene, which is the raw material for the PDPP units, he said."
26,2019-10-13,BPCL,"How BPCL’s stake sale will pan out for minority shareholders
A cash-strapped Centre is pressing ahead with its stake-sale plan in five PSUs, but it is moot if minority shareholders of oil marketing company Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) will partake of the expected big gains.
The answer, to a large extent, will depend on who the Centre sells its 53.29 per cent stake in BPCL to — to a private player (domestic, such as Reliance Industries, or foreign, such as ExxonMobil/Saudi Aramco/ADNOC), to another PSU, or to a hydrocarbon major such as Indian Oil. If it is the latter, minority shareholders might get the short shrift, as happened last year when the Centre executed an inter-PSU transaction and sold its 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC.
At that time, the Centre cut itself a neat deal and pocketed a 14 per cent premium to the HPCL stock’s prevailing market price. In the normal course, ONGC would have had to make an open offer to acquire an additional 26 per cent stake from minority shareholders at the same price. But ONGC was exempted from this obligation, depriving minority shareholders the benefit of the premium over the stock price.
The Centre did this by including phrases that helped avoid an open offer. Prior to the deal, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management amended the terms to state that “HPCL will continue to be a government company in terms of Section 2(45) of the Companies Act, 2013 and will continue to be controlled by the Government of India through ONGC under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas”. So, with effectively no transfer of actual control from the Centre, there was no requirement for an open offer by ONGC. The Centre likely did this to shield ONGC’s already stretched balance-sheet. 
The script may be repeated in the BPCL stake-sale, too, if the buyer is a PSU. 
Also, a stake sale in BPCL to a PSU will likely mean a lower valuation. That’s because the Centre should be able to command a higher controlling premium for BPCL from private players than from a PSU. 
BPCL is a strong, profitable company accounting for about 15 per cent of the refining capacity and about a quarter of the fuel retail outlets in India. The company also has a presence in the upstream business with stakes in gas fields in Brazil and Mozambique. Besides, it holds stakes in high-potential gas utility companies such as Petronet and Indraprastha Gas. In short, an attractive buy for a private player seeking a major presence in the attractive Indian hydrocarbons market.
If the Centre aims to maximise its revenue from the BPCL stake sale, privatising it would seem the logical choice, especially given the increased pressure on the fiscal deficit postthe recent corporate tax cut, slowing GDP growth and lower-than-expected GST collections. In this context, achieving the ambitious disinvestment target of ₹1.05-lakh crore in FY20 will be crucial for the Centre, and that will depend to a large extent on rich proceeds from the BPCL stake sale.
The BPCL stock has run up sharply in recent weeks on the stake-sale buzz, and at the current price of ₹488 a share, can yield the Centre about ₹56,000 crore. Some analysts expect a greater upside in the case of a privatisation. For instance, a recent report by Sbicap Securities says that if privatised, the potential valuation of BPCL could rise to over ₹700 a share.
But privatisation may be easier said than done. One, there is strong resistance to the move from BPCL’s employees and Opposition parties. Next, the Centre is running against a tight deadline with less than six months to the fiscal year-end — privatisation at the best valuation of a complex entity such as BPCL would need more time. Also, it is to be seen whether the Centre will be ready to bite the bullet and let go fully of a Maharatna company in the politically crucial oil and gas sector, where it often intervenes, even if indirectly, to keep fuel prices under check.
A stake sale to another PSU will be a more convenient and quicker choice. But that may mean lower valuation for all shareholders, especially the minority ones."

The employee unions in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd ( BPCL) are planning to go on a strike, as a mark of protest against the proposed privatisation of the company. The strike will coincide with the winter session of the parliament.
The first strike would be a two-day token strike, and after that, an indefinite strike would be launched with the help of unions in all other public sector companies. The strategy of the strikes would be chalked out on October 26 in Mumbai.
Any prolong strike in the company will have a significant impact on the availability of fuels and lubricants in the country. For 2018-19 BPCL refineries aggregate throughput, which included its subsidiary and a joint venture was 36.76 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT), while the national figure, which includes private refineries was about 249.36 MMT. In effect, the BPCL controls about 14.74 per cent of the total refining capacity in the country.
Aggregate throughput is the capacity of a refinery for refining crude oil over a given period.
General secretary of Cochin Refinery Workers’ Association, MG Aji told BusinessLine that in Kochi there are four recognised unions, out of which one union associated with Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) has a separate plan for protest. But the other three unions have formed a joint action committee for a demonstration and strike. On October 26 a meeting would be held in Mumbai for the announcement of the national strike, he said."

Left parties stage a protest against Centre’s move to sell Numaligarh Refinery, and the rise in prices of essential commodities in Guwahati
   -  -


Security agencies are uncomfortable with the Centre’s plan to sell BPCL to private entities as the company controls the Assam-based Numaligarh refinery, which is located in a sensitive and restive area.
A senior security official said that after the stake sale, the private investors could get their own manpower on the company’s board and the ground in Assam, which is what is giving jitters to the agencies. The old sparks of violence should not again spread in the State. NRL controls a large share of petroleum products in the North-East and any kind of strike will impact the availability of these products in the region. The strike could also have a cascading effect on local politics, the official said.
The refinery located in upper Assam was commissioned in April 1999. It is a part of the Assam Accord, which was signed between the Centre and the leaders of the Assam Movement in August 1985, after years of intense violence. The Accord was meant to bring reconciliation and peace in the region. The refinery is controlled through BPCL’s subsidiary Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL).
In the last 10 days, talks of BPCL stake sale has led to massive agitations across Assam. The workers’ union in NRL has been regularly holding protests outside the refinery.
On the other hand, a former senior executive with BPCL said that even if the Centre manages to ring-fence NRL and preserves it as PSU, it will impact the valuation of BPCL in the market.
The General Secretary of Numaligarh Refinery Employees Union, Binod Gogoi said that the refinery and its associate offices have 954 permanent and 2,000 temporary employees. The workers and the executives have been protesting and will continue to protest until the privatisation plan is scrapped. The Union in a memorandum addressed to the Prime Minister on the proposed disinvestment of NRL and BPCL, said that NRL was set up as per the outcome of the historic Assam Accord, which was signed after six long years of Assam agitation. The agitation costed 855 lives, “Therefore, no one can deny the fact that Numaligarh Refinery symbolises the sentiments and emotions of every individual of Assam.” The memorandum has been submitted to the Deputy Commissioner, Golaghat. One of the reasons that NRL was set up in such a remote place far away from national capital was to develop the poor economic infrastructure and backward social condition of the region. Since first commercial production NRL has paid more than ₹30,000 crore to the national and State exchequer, the memorandum added."

 The government is looking into state-owned Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd’s (BPCL) investments in a gas block in Mozambique and has not yet formally given its approval to the firm for further spendings, sources said.
Bharat PetroResources Ltd (BPRL), an exploration and production subsidiary of BPCL, had in August 2008 bought a 10 per cent stake in Area-1 Offshore of the Rovuma Block from the US energy major Anadarko Petroleum Corp for $75 million. That same month Videocon, through its subsidiary, acquired a 10 per cent stake in the same block for an equivalent block.
Sources privy to the development said Anadarko had originally offered a 20 per cent stake in Area-1 to BPCL but the state-owned firm bought only half of it and the rest was picked up by Videocon.
 Videocon in 2013 sold the same stake to ONGC Videsh Ltd for $2.475 billion.
Sources said the government is looking into reasons why BPCL did not buy the entire 20 per cent stake offered to it by Anadarko. Also, why it did not get other state-owned firms like ONGC involved if it wanted the exploration risk to be shared by splitting the 20 per cent stake.
These inquests have led to the government not formally according approval to BPCL to invest a further $2.2-2.4 billion in the development of a giant gas field discovered in Area-1.
 The proposal was reviewed by an informal ministerial panel headed by Home Minister Amit Shah in June.
The BJP-led NDA government since first coming to power in 2014 has been critical of the nearly $6 billion spent by the Indian public sector firms to take 30 per cent stake in the Rovuma Offshore Area-1 in Mozambique during the Congress-led UPA regime, as falling oil and gas prices did not justify such huge investments.
Besides buying Videocon’s 10 per cent stake for $2.475 billion, ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had bought another 10 per cent stake from project operator Anadarko of US for $2.64 billion.
It later gave 4 per cent out of the stake bought from Videocon to Oil India Ltd.
Sources said even the OVL deal had in the first term of Modi government come under the scanner following allegations that the company might have overpaid Videocon.
Videocon was in 2012 willing to sell its stake to OVL at a small premium to the price Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production paid for acquiring an 8.5 per cent stake in the same block from Cove Energy for 1.22 billion ($1.9 billion at the exchange rate prevalent at that time).
The 10 per cent stake, they said, was available to OVL for about $2.3 billion but the company a year later paid $2.475 billion to Videocon. OVL had strongly refuted the allegations then and it isn’t known what happened to that scrutiny.
Woodlands, Texas-based energy exploration company Anadarko, which was later acquired by Occidental, is the operator of the block. Other partners in Area 1 include Mitsui with 20 per cent stake, ENH (15 per cent) and PTTEP (8.5 per cent).
Gas from the block is to be converted into liquefied natural gas (LNG) for transportation by ships to markets like India."

Various trade unions and independent associations functioning in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) have decided to strike work on November 28 against the Centre’s reported move to privatise both the oil companies. 
A statement released by trade unions said a joint convention of Opposition trade unions, various independent associations and Shiv Sena’s Sena Kamgar Federation, held in Mumbai on Saturday, had decided to support the strike. 
“The convention condemned the Narendra Modi government for its suicidal decision and aggressive move to privatise even the strategic PSUs and government departments, including defence production, public sector banks and insurance, ports, and many excellently-run PSUs, including in the sectors of coal, power, steel, oil and petroleum, heavy engineering and container services,” the statement said. 
A declaration passed by the convention said the government’s and private business lobbies used to resort to vilification campaign over the so-called poor performance of the PSUs concerned. “But the shocking decision of the present government to completely privatise BPCL and HPCL has established that the Central government of the day is totally under the clutch of a few crony private business giants and their foreign collaborators,” it said.
The convention also decided to jointly organise protests in defence of workers of BPCL and HPCL. “All the Unions will serve strike notice on November 11,” the statement added. A protest week will be organised from November 11. A national convention of petroleum workers from all the oil and petroleum PSUs will be held here on November 20."
21,2019-10-30,BPCL,"BPCL divestment: Strategic sale can spur pricing reforms
The Centre’s plan to sell 53.29 per cent stake in BPCL needs to be carefully executed. The proceeds from this sale — about ₹61,000 crore at BPCL’s current stock price levels — will form the centrepiece of the Centre’s ambitious disinvestment target of ₹1.05 lakh crore in FY20. A left hand-to-right hand transaction with another public sector oil company, similar to the HPCL-ONGC deal last year, might seem a politically palatable option. But this will result in sub-optimal realisations for both the Centre and minority shareholders, who may be denied the benefit of a higher price in an open offer. The other more rewarding option that the Centre seems to be actively pursuing is strategic disinvestment, or privatisation. The Centre can command a higher controlling premium for BPCL from private players, domestic or foreign, than from a PSU. This is in view of BPCL’s position as a profitable Maharatna company accounting for about 15 per cent of the refining capacity and a quarter of the fuel retail outlets in India. Besides, BPCL has stakes in gas companies such as Petronet and Indraprastha Gas, and a presence in gas fields in Brazil and Mozambique.
Time for the disinvestment, however, is rapidly running out, with just about five months to the fiscal year-end, and the hurdles numerous. One, BPCL’s employees have expressed reservations and their concerns need to be addressed. Two, there is some political resistance, especially in Assam where the BPCL-controlled Numaligarh refinery was established as part of the Assam Accord of 1985. Three, recent reports that BPCL’s Mozambique gas deal is under the government’s scanner could spook potential investors. Four, determining the optimal valuation of the multi-part complex entity that BPCL is, may need time. It is essential to realise the best value for a strong asset and not rush through with the sale. Five, the FDI policy may have to be amended to enable foreign players to acquire more than the current limit of 49 per cent in the PSU refiner. The Centre retaining a golden share, even a small one, may put off potential investors. Last but not the least, the Centre will have to convince investors of its intent to have genuine market-linked pricing of petrol and diesel, and adjust taxes to reduce prices at the pump. The reliance on petroleum to boost tax revenues has carried on for too long. That said, the recent relaxation of fuel retailing norms indicates that reforms are afoot, with the role of private players set to grow.
The argument that privatising BPCL will compromise the energy security of the country is debatable. The Centre will continue to have a significant presence in the fuel market through its majority stake in Indian Oil — the largest PSU oil refiner and marketer. If ONGC continues to hold its stake in HPCL, the Centre will have control here too, though indirectly. BPCL’s stake sale can usher the necessary pricing and fiscal reforms, if managed sensibly."

As oil marketing companies face headwinds from the negative growth in diesel sales, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) is looking at offloading some portion of its inventory through export sales under term contracts to fetch better prices, director finance N Vijayagopal said in an interview. Excerpts:
 
What does the September quarter financial results indicate about the state of play in the oil marketing business?
The Q2 performance of refineries in India and globally is affected generally by the crack spreads of diesel and motor spirit (MS).
If you compare the crack spreads of diesel and MS to the corresponding period last year, diesel has gone up by $1 to a barrel and MS has come down by $2 to a barrel. These are the products which gives us money. So, MS cracks coming down by $2 and diesel going up by $1 effectively evens it out because we make 20-22 per cent from MS and 45-48 per cent from diesel. Therefore, generally, our margins should have been at the same levels if all the other factors remained the same.
Our margin was about $3.3 at the core level, excluding the inventory gains and losses in Q2FY19. It was $3.8 this quarter ― that’s a $0.5 increase. We are not unhappy but the only thing is that even $3 is not a good number for us. Yet, compared with IOC’s $1.28 and HPCL’s $2.7, we are not bad off or worse off. But, I would have been happy if the margin was, let’s say $6.
Has diesel contributed much to this?
There is no growth in diesel sales in the country now. In the second quarter, the country’s diesel demand has actually come down by about 2.5 per cent, compared to the second quarter of the previous year.
Why?
Demand for diesel is generally a reflection of GDP growth. We have not seen this kind of a de-growth in diesel in the recent past.
Is there a revival in sight on diesel demand?
We don’t see any reversal of this de-growth overnight. Upto September, the growth has been minus 2.5 per cent and October has been worse.
BPCL’s growth rate has come down by 2.4 per cent. Our minus growth is lower compared to IOC. BPCL cannot perform in a vacuum; we’ll have to work only within the country’s diesel market. BPCL cannot be any different.
What was the actual sales in diesel?
We have a market of 40 mt in a year. Of this, 50 per cent or 20 mt will be diesel; and roughly in a quarter, it will be 5 mt.
We exported 200 TMT of diesel in September because it could not be sold in the country. We sold it to traders in Singapore. So, there is a possibility (for exports).
However, when we produce diesel anticipating market demand in India and then sell in distress in the export market, the discount will be very high. That’s the problem we are facing.
How do you propose to work around this?
We need to produce diesel and cannot reduce the throughput because it is not profitable. But, we can plan ahead for the next three months for exports so that we can term-up. When we commit to give so much in November, December, and so on, then the prices will be better. So, we term-up for diesel because we don’t anticipate an overnight improvement and reversal of this decline.
How critical is this?
It is a matter of concern for the oil industry because diesel is giving the maximum. For example, MS crack is $8 a barrel, while diesel crack is double at $16 a barrel. So, when diesel gives me maximum money and half of my production is diesel and when diesel (demand) suffers, we are very badly affected.
Then, you are left holding inventory…
We are carrying inventory. In fact, we have a problem of carrying excess inventory because we don’t anticipate any increase or improvement in the price situation anytime soon. So, we cannot keep inventory for three months. Therefore, we are having an inventory to the extent possible and permissible, but there is a risk in carrying inventory.
Are you looking to cut down on diesel production?
No. We cannot cut down on diesel production alone; we can cut down on the crude throughput. I don’t think that reducing the diesel throughput is a better option because we will maintain the throughput and export diesel. Because of IMO regulations from January 1, 2020, we are expecting the current crack spread on diesel to further go up. That increase, we will be sacrificing by exporting. So, we won’t be worse off; still, we’ll be able to make money.
So, it’s a cause for concern, what to do with diesel?
You can say that. It’s a cause for concern because half my sale is diesel and diesel is not moving. Actually, not moving is not the correct thing to say, don’t be under that impression. We are selling 20 mt of diesel. If we need to export 1 mt probably in the next six months, we will still make full money on the 19 mt; I mt could have actually given me full money, now we’ll be losing a part of it. So, to that extent, it’s a cause for concern. My profit will be affected because of exporting diesel. The loss on exports is a very small amount and we would not be losing even a single paisa if there is an environment and an eco-system of growth to sell diesel in India. Without diesel nothing moves in India.
The one-time tax reversal of Rs 580.33 crore in Q2 came as a huge relief…
The tax refund was a very significant contributor to our PAT. But, even without that, our PAT is very good. We have been holding on to the market share growth; we are leaders in market share growth in MS and No 2 in diesel. Though all of us are negative in diesel growth in Q2, we are still No 2 in diesel.
Diesel is a concern for all of us. If diesel doesn’t go, we have a problem. I’m not commenting on the government’s difficulties given the global situation, Chinese demand issues, etc. The government may be struggling with a difficult global environment.
We have never seen a diesel negative growth like this in the recent past. Diesel growth is actually critical for our operations and profitability because that is the most profitable product.
Earlier, MS used to give $12 a barrel when diesel was giving $15 per barrel.
MS crack has come down very drastically ― to minus levels ― because of the Chinese slowdown in Q3 of FY19.It was at $1,1.5 or $2 a barrel. It was very poor for us. As a government company, we have no option and also as a customer-friendly company, we have no option. We have to supply petrol.
Petrol was not giving us much money. Now, MS cracks have improved and is in the range of $7-8 a barrel, but it is still not enough.
Has that impacted your gross refining margins (GRM)?
That is one reason why you find our GRMs are $3 a barrel; we cannot perform in a vacuum. We would have preferred to get a GRM of around $6-6.5 a barrel having invested so much money in the upgradation and modernisation of the Kochi refinery and being in the midst of a major revamp of the Mumbai refinery with huge investments and for producing B6 grade fuel.
We need to be getting adequate compensation for these investments, otherwise investors won’t be happy. Diesel is therefore, a concern. I’m not overemphasising that, am only stating the fact."
18,2019-11-17,BPCL,"State-run oil companies take a knock
Weak refining margins, subdued volumes and inventory losses took a toll on the performance of the three public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) — Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL — in the recent September 2019 quarter.
Indian Oil’s consolidated profit in the quarter fell nearly 86 per cent y-o-y to ₹468 crore, while that of HPCL fell about 22 per cent y-o-y to ₹762 crore. BPCL did better than its peers with about a 3 per cent rise in profit to ₹1,503 crore, but this too was nothing to write home about. But for a tax-reversal of about ₹580 crore, BPCL’s bottom-line, too, would have shrunk.
The major drag on the companies’ performance was a sharp fall in their gross refining margin (GRM) — the difference between the price of their product slate and the cost of crude oil.
Indian Oil’s reported GRM in the September 2019 quarter fell the most to $1.3 a barrel from $6.8 in the year-ago period.
BPCL’s reported GRM fell to $3.4 a barrel from $5.6, and that of HPCL fell to $2.8 a barrel from $4.8 in the year-ago period.
 
While inventory losses due to dip in fuel prices aggravated the impact on reported GRMs, especially for Indian Oil, the core GRMs, too, were weak during the quarter, except for BPCL which saw some rise.
Weak domestic economic conditions and resultant subdued volumes, especially the contraction in diesel sales, adversely impacted the financial performance and margins of the OMCs. Also, a planned shutdown at HPCL to upgrade to BS-VI fuels did not help.
Indian Oil’s sales revenue fell about 16 per cent y-o-y in the September 2019 quarter, while that of HPCL and BPCL fell 10-11 per cent y-o-y.
Marketing margins for the three companies improved in the quarter compared with the year-ago period, but this could not make up for the other challenges.
Interestingly, all the three companies have chosen, for now, to continue with the earlier tax regime. They have not shifted to the recently announced lower corporate tax rate regime that would have entailed giving up some tax incentives, including lapse of the accumulated MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax) credit.
The weakness in gross refining margin in the September 2019 quarter is a continuation of what was seen in the June 2019 quarter. So, for the six months from April to September 2019, Indian Oil’s GRM crashed to $2.96 a barrel from $8.45 in the year-ago period. BPCL’s GRM for the six months ended September 2019 more than halved to $3.10 a barrel from $6.52 in the year-ago period, and HPCL’s GRM, too, fell sharply to $1.87 from $5.93.
The environment in the refining market remains weak and so does the demand conditions, given the growth challenges in the economy. This could reflect in the financial performance of the OMCs in the coming quarters, too.
On the positive side, the International Maritime Organization’s regulations that mandate cleaner fuels for ships come into effect in January 2020. This should translate into an increase in demand for the higher-grade products of the OMCs and support their GRMs.
The weak financial performance of the OMCs has also reflected in their stock performance. Since early June, the Indian Oil and HPCL stocks have fallen about 22 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.
The BPCL stock was also on the back foot until a couple of months ago when news about the impending stake sale by the Centre in the company saw the stock taking off; it is now up about 20 per cent since early June."

The Centre on Wednesday gave in-principle approval for strategic disinvestment of the government shareholding in five public sector enterprises along with management control.
These five PSUs are Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL); Shipping Corporation of India; Container Corporation of India; Tehri Hydro Power Development Corporation (THDCIL), and North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO).
Both THDCIL and NEEPCO will go to NTPC, which will acquire the government’s holding of 74.23 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively.
In the case of Concor, the Centre plans to sell 30.8 per cent while retaining 24 per cent."
16,2019-11-21,BPCL,"Why the BPCL share price has fallen after Govt’s divestment announcement
The BPCL share price has shown a muted response to the government announcement to divest its entire stake in the company. BPCL’s share price declined by 2.74 per cent to Rs 529 after the market opened on Thursday. The key reason is the anticipation of a lower valuation for the company's Numaligarh Refinery.
Also, the BPCL share price has witnessed an over 70 per cent rise since August 23. In less than three months, the share has touched a high of Rs 549 from a low of Rs 308 in anticipation of a disinvestment announcement from the government. Therefore, at the current price, BPCL is fully valued in the near term, considering the disinvestment decision.  
Analysts told BusinessLine that BPCL’s overall valuation could be impacted as the company’s Numaligarh Refinery (NRL) would be carved out, to be taken over by another PSU.
Read also: Centre clears strategic divestment in five PSUs
Brokerage house Nirmal Bang is of the view that a share swap for taking over the NRL stake could imply some potential downside to BPCL's overall valuation. That is if NRL is valued at less than 10 times its price-to-earnings ratio. Such a scenario would impact BPCL’s earnings per share by Rs 6. The brokerage has, therefore, given a target of Rs 512 for BPCL shares, following the government’s big announcement on Wednesday, post market hours.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said the government would sell its entire 53.29 per cent stake in BPCL, but the sale would exclude BPCL's NRL, in which the company holds 61.65 per cent stake.
“Our replacement cost based value of Rs 583 for BPCL includes Rs 62 per share or 10.6 per cent. Our Base case PE (price to earning) based target price of Rs 512 includes a similar value for NRL. The stake sale, excluding NRL, will only impact government receipts,” Nirmal Bang said in a morning note to its clients.
For BPCL investors, the stake will still offer value based on how it is valued in the proposed transfer to another PSU, most likely IOC or OIL India, which holds 26 per cent stake in NRL, Nirmal Bang said."

The five PSUs in which the Centre will sell stake are Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL); Shipping Corporation of India; Container Corporation of India; Tehri Hydro Power Development Corporation (THDCIL), and North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO).
Speaking to presspersons on the sidelines of the Second Indian Steel Association-Steel Conclave, Pradhan said, “We have been clear since 2014 that sectors where businesses can sustain themselves should be allowed to continue. Government has no business to be in the business. The rights of consumers in India are supreme.”
He said the move to sell stake in CPSEs is in line with the aim to bring more professionalism in some sectors. He gave the example of the telecom and aviation sector.
The Centre on Wednesday gave in-principle approval for the strategic disinvestment of the government shareholding in five public sector enterprises, along with management control. While the other PSUs are being sold in toto, Numaligarh Refinery Ltd, a subsidiary of BPCL, will not be part of the strategic sale according to the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.
Responding to queries on why NRL is being excluded, Pradhan said, “Including or excluding anything is to be decided by market experts and strategists ... Numaligarh Refinery is an outcome of the Assam Accord. It was set up after Assam was integrated within the India’s framework, following a student movement that resulted in dialogues.”
“NRL will maintain the identity of a government company. A successful PSU will be given its responsibility. The Assam government had made a request for the same to the Prime Minister and this was accepted,” he added.
On whether the government has already found a buyer for BPCL or if another Public Sector Enterprise is going to step in, as was the case with ONGC buying out HPCL, Pradhan said, “The nitty gritty will be kept in mind when the next decisions are taken. But when I say that the government has no business to stay in business, then a lot of things are included in this.”
Responding to a query on the timeline for the strategic sale, he said, “The Finance Minister has said the strategic sale is expected to be completed this year itself.”"

Delays in divestment of Bharat Petroleum Corporation's (BPCL) stake by the Government will impact India’s fiscal deficit and risk its slippage beyond 3.5 per cent.
The Government this week announced that would divest its 53 per cent stake in the public sector (PSU) refining major.There is widespread belief in the stock markets that the Government stake in BPCL, worth more than Rs 50,000 crore, would be bought over by a consortium of players involving Saudi’s largest oil producer Aramco or another major global oil company but potential delay could hit India’s currency too, analysts say. 
All eyes are not on conclusion of Aramco’s $25 billion IPO post, which the company is like to give a definitive idea on its investments in the Indian oil and gas sector.The difference between total revenue and total expenditure of the Government is termed as fiscal deficit. Slippage in fiscal deficit means widening Government loss.“Any potential delay in the BPCL deal beyond FY (financial year) 2020 increases the risk of fiscal slippage beyond 3.5 per cent,” said Teresa John, economist, Nirmal Bang, a Mumbai based institutional brokerage house.“In our view, staying within the escape clause of 3.5 per cent will require the Government to exceed the divestment target of Rs 1050 bn (Rs 1 lakh crore) with some marginal expenditure cuts. Although we are optimistic about the Government’s divestment push, we have retained our fiscal deficit estimate at 3.9 per cent given uncertainty around the timeline for sale of some of these assets,” Nirmal Bang said in a morning note to clients.The brokerage house further said that India’s Rupee will continue to trade with a depreciation bias and their average rupee forecast for FY20 is 72.1.“However, the risk of fiscal slippage is largely priced in by the bond and currency markets. Therefore, any positive news flow, say for example BPCL being sold to a strategic foreign investor which results in significant foreign inflows may be marginally positive for the INR in the short term. In the event of slippage in divestment targets, the Rupee may trade above 72. A positive divestment outcome with significant foreign inflows may pull the Rupee back to around 70-70.5,” the note said."

Sangh Parivar-led trade union BMS has decided to support the one-day token strike on November 28 called by Opposition trade unions in the oil sector.

""These all CPSUs pay huge amount of taxes, duties and dividend to the Government. We are of the strong opinion that the CPSUs are the backbone of our economy.

11,2019-11-26,BPCL,"BPCL strategic sale is a tight walk for government
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has undertaken a tough task when she said that the government would like to see the strategic disinvestment of public sector Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) to be concluded this fiscal.
Just about four months to finish the entire process, which has to happen in two parts: Strategic disinvestment of the government’s shareholding of 53.29 per cent in BPCL — except BPCL’s equity shareholding of 61.65 per cent in Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) and management control thereof; and BPCL’s shareholding of 61.65 per cent in NRL along with transfer of management control to a central public sector enterprise operating in the oil and gas sector.
The change of guard at NRL may not be tough. Also doable, if the government puts its might behind, is the BPCL sale. 
But the challenge will be to do it in a transparent manner so that tomorrow it does not come back to haunt those involved with the process.
 The government will also need to ensure that it does not seem like a desperate sale, given the stress that the economy is facing. 
Depending on the competitive intensity during bidding, the proceeds the government is likely to garner for a full-stake sale could be in the range of ₹60,000-70,000 crore, according to industry sources.
Though the process is yet to start, the names of prospective bidders are already doing the rounds — Exxon, Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company or ADNOC, Shell, TOTAL, and, of course, the desi biggie Reliance Industries Ltd. A lot will depend on the criterion which the government puts out for the prospective bidders. Or will it be ‘tailored’ to accommodate just one? 
Whether it be a local or foreign entity who emerges the winner, what the country will get in return matters here. In return for the stake will the country get an assured supply of crude oil or an assured market for India’s refined product exports? Or is the sale intended just to generate revenue for a cash-stressed economy?
 On the policy front, the current FDI norms for the petroleum and natural gas sector allow 100 per cent automatic route for exploration and production and refining by private companies, but for public sector companies in refining, the norm is 49 per cent on automatic route without any divestment/dilution of domestic equity in the existing public sector units. 
One could argue that the FDI policy may not pose a hindrance as it could be tweaked through an administrative note.
What about the case of a joint venture? For instance, Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd, which was formed as a joint venture between Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Oman Oil Company, runs Bina Refinery. So, JV may not be an issue if the partner does not have a problem.
A larger question can emerge if the bidders desire to buy one business of BPCL. Today, BPCL has overseas interests, refining and retail. Will the government go for a three-way split — overseas, refining and retailing — to get a better valuation? 
The government needs money, but BPCL is not a distress sale, so a lot will be dependent on the criterion to decide the bidders, the bidding mechanism, and the buyer gets us in return. All this in next four months. A tight-rope walk indeed."

The trade unions claimed that the one-day nationwide strike on Thursday by BPCL workers against privatisation was a “huge success.” Apart from the 10 trade unions belonging to Opposition parties, Sangh Parivar’s BMS had also given a separate strike notice in various BPCL units. 
CITU General Secretary Tapan Sen said in a statement that the nationwide strike was successfully carried out by the workers of not just BPCL, but the workers of HPCL and ONGC (MRPL) refineries and marketing operations. He said the strike, organised by the National Federations of Oil and Petroleum Workers, was supported by around 30,000 regular and contract workers from 50 work-place level affiliates of these federations. 
“The huge magnitude of the strike has clearly demonstrated the determination of the workers to stop the Narendra Modi Government’s move to privatise BPCL and HPCL. The workers have participated in the strike braving the threat and intimidation by Modi Government and prohibitory orders obtained by the managements at behest of ruling dispensation through various High Courts,” he claimed. 
BMS leader Girish Arya too said the strike was successful. He, however, said that the BMS gave strike notice only in BPCL establishments. 
“The total workers in the Marketing operations of BPCL, HPCL and IOCL in all the southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh participated in the strike in full strength. Tanker Lorry Workers also joined the strike. In Mangalore Refinery (MRPL) the permanent and contract workers numbering around 5,000 were on strike,” Sen said. 
In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena’s trade union had also supported the strike. “The biggest bottling plant of Asia situated in the region at Uran, near Mumbai had to be shut down due to the impact of the strike,” Sen said. The striking workers organised a protest near Jantar Mantar here which was were addressed MPs and Central Trade Union Leaders."
9,2019-11-29,BPCL,"BPCL gets Cabinet approval for additional equity investment in E&P arm, Mozambique LNG project
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) is understood to have given its nod for additional investment of $2,670 million by Bharat Petro Resources Ltd (BRPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), for a LNG project in Mozambique. 
The CCEA, which had met on Wednesday, is also said to have given the green signal for additional equity investment of ₹10,000 crore by BPCL into the equity share capital of BRPL, sources told BusinessLine. There was no official communication on the decision by the government. 
Why this when the government is preparing to sell its stake in BPCL? What does it gain?
These decisions should not come as a surprise if one sees them as purely business, as for any company into oil and gas sector investments are constant. Development projects have their own timeline for cash calls and investments cannot be deferred. 
But, if one goes by the timing, this will definitely help upping the valuation of the company when the prospective bidders assess the assets which BPCL has. One should remember that when a bidder does its due diligence it is not just based on the market cap of the company. Buyers have many other questions to ask on the balance-sheet of a company on sale. 
The investment will definitely enhance the potential, market watchers say. However, there is also another aspect — Maharashtra, which is an important State for the revenue flow into Delhi, has undergone a shift in political dynamics. Maharasthra is where BPCL is headquartered. During the course of disinvestment, the State could find ways of being a party spoiler. 
So, investments like this can offer cushion when valuation is done. Ideally even the market should factor in such investments. Currently, the industry feels that depending on the competitive intensity during bidding, the proceeds the government is likely to garner for a full-stake sale could be in the range of ₹60,000-70,000 crore. 
Whether these announcements will be see an uptick in investment only time will tell, as the Department of Investment and Public Assessment Management (DIPAM) prepares for the stake sale. Last month, DIPAM had called for request for proposals for appointments of advisors for strategic disinvestment, legal and one asset valuer for the purpose. 
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had indicated recently that the government would like to finish the entire process this fiscal. BPCL disinvestment is to happen in two parts: Strategic disinvestment of the government’s shareholding of 53.29 per cent in BPCL — except BPCL’s equity shareholding of 61.65 per cent in Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) and management control thereof; and BPCL’s shareholding of 61.65 per cent in NRL along with transfer of management control to a central public sector enterprise operating in the oil and gas sector.
The Wednesday CCEA nod is said to be for additional investment by BPRL in the 2-Train initial LNG project and pre-development activities for the subsequent Trains for development of gas resources in Offshore Area 1, Rovuma Basin, Mozambique. BPRL holds 10 per cent participating interest in the project along with ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of ONGC, which holds 10 per cent. Besides, OVL and Oil India Ltd jointly hold another 10 per cent (6 per cent OVL and 4 per cent OIL). 
The current operator of the Area 1 project is Total SA (26.5 per cent). The other concessionaires in the project are Mitsui (20 per cent), Mozambique State Energy Company ENH (15 per cent) and Thai company PTTEP (8.5 per cent)."

Defending the Centre’s decision to divest the stake in the refiner BPCL, Anurag Thakur, Union Minister of State for Finance, said that funds that are mobilised through such stake sale will be used for infrastructure projects planned by the government.
Replying to a question by a delegate at a session on ‘Money Matters’ at the ‘Mangaluru Lit Fest 2019’, Thakur said that the government has no business to be in running a commercial enterprise. This should be left to private sector.
He wanted to know from the delegate would he like to buy something that is making huge losses.
“Do you think the Government should be in the business? Government is here to facilitate, and I think the Government has taken the right step to monetise the assets available with it. Our need is to have more effective management,” he said.
Some of public sector undertakings (PSUs) have been put on block to raise money and to invest further into the India’s growth story. The Government has set a target of investing ₹100 lakh crore into the infrastructure segment. That will create a lot of jobs and better infrastructure, he said.
Mentioning the Centre’s decision to back out from Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), he said this is another major example of how the Modi government is putting national interests in the forefront.
This was not the case in the past, he said, adding that the countries pushing for RCEP are now willing to come around to address India’s concerns. This only shows how the world as a whole is recognising India’s growing economic prowess, he said.
To a question on the impact of some of the economic policies of the Government, he said these policies may seem to pinch an individual in the short-term. However, those will bring in rewards when the country emerges as one of the top three economies in the world, he said."

Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) has started doorstep delivery of diesel for industrial and bulk customers in Noida from Wednesday. A company statement said the delivery of the fuel will commence from the Shaheed Ramendra Pratap Singh Petrol Pump at Sector-95 in Noida. With this, BPCL has become the first company to begin door step delivery of fuel in the National Capital Region.
A BPCL official told BusinessLine the fuel will be delivered at the same price available at the retail outlets.
According to the statement, the service will benefit housing societies, malls, hospitals, banks, large transporters, construction sites, and small and big industries. The customers can book diesel through a mobile app and get it delivered at a given location.
The retail outlet operator will have to procure a mobile dispensing unit, get approvals from BPCL and also install a separate fuel dispensation outlet to enable this service, the official said.
At present, the industrial and bulk customers, who require the fuel, have to visit the nearest retail outlet to fill in containers/barrels. The new initiative aims to make the process convenient for people to get the oil delivered at their doorstep. The fuel delivery vehicle comes fitted with a mobile dispenser and a 4,000-litre fuel tank, the statement added."

BPCL’s decision to build the terminal at Krishnapatnam port was dictated by the need for such facilities on the Eastern coast




Officers from Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) came together to oppose the proposed disinvestment of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) on Monday.
Taking a strong position against the proposed disinvestment of BPCL, Convenor of Confederation of Maharatna Officers Association (COMCO), Mukul Kumar said that the move to transfer the management control is regressive and non-beneficial.
“Is it another East India Company movement for India? Offering huge Indian Petroleum sector on the platter to a foreign company would herald another era of profiteering, exploitation, tyranny and flight of capital from the country,” a statement from the associations said.
“If BPCL is sold on the basis of latest market cap of ₹ 1.06 lakh crore, the maximum realisation for 53.29 per cent stake of Government of India would be only ₹ 74 thousand crore, including control premium of 30 per cent,” according to the associations.
“Against the current preliminary indicative market price of the total assets of BPCL of ₹ 9 lakh crore (in-house estimates), there would be a minimum notional loss of ₹ 4.46 lakh crore to the country,” the statement added. This ₹ 9 lakh crore valuation is based on the replacement valuation method.
Officials said that the government soon will be informed about this estimated valuation by the associations. Responding to a query on whether it is a scam, officials said, “It is for you to assess when selling something worth ₹ 9 lakh crore for much lesser.”"

The Union Government seems to have bitten off more than it can chew with its decision to sell its stake in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL).
While the sale of one of India’s large public sector undertakings could help reduce our ever-widening fiscal deficit, what happens to the social obligations that PSUs meet, including that of employment? 
In these challenging times where the job situation is bleak, it’s an especially pertinent question.
There is concern about the fate of over 12,000 employees (6,500 are executives and an equal number workmen) once BPCL is sold. Not surprisingly, there have been widespread protests — including a very unique one in Kochi (BPCL owns Kochi Refinery) where college students have named the venue of an ongoing arts festival after the PSU.
The government has given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of Government of India shareholding of 53.29 per cent in BPCL, except its equity shareholding of 61.65 per cent in Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL). The NRL piece will be sold to a Central Public Sector Enterprise operating in the oil and gas sector.
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), Ministry of Finance, in its guidelines on disinvestment, does talk about protection to employees. 
It says that suitable clauses may be incorporated in the Share Purchase Agreement/Share Holders Agreement for the benefit of existing employees of the company and to protect such employees, post-disinvestment.
But once an entity is sold, whether these conditions can be enforced is a moot point.
“I do not think that the Government of India will be able to assure job security to BPCL employees at any level or even to the board members, beyond the minimum time period stipulated in the offer for sale. The new management in the private sector will definitely like to have its own senior management and minimum workforce to run the company in a most profitable manner,” says RS Sharma, former Chairman and Managing Director of ONGC.
Echoing similar sentiments is UD Choubey, former Director-General, Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (SCOPE) — an apex body of the Public Sector Enterprises of India — who feels that there would be enormous complexity related with human resources and taxation issues in the sale of a PSU.
What is causing additional concern is that unlike some of the other PSUs facing sale (Air India, for instance), BPCL is a profitable entity. As Choubey, who was also former CMD of GAIL (India), says, “I have also been of the opinion that disinvestment or for that purpose strategic sale of a profit making PSU is not the panacea for mobilising resources. There is a need for detailed analysis on how much dividend government exchequer loses because of disinvestment or likely to lose dividend from the sale of BPCL or such sale.”
“Buying government shares by one PSU in another PSU will still be a better way to mobilise resources for the government, as it keeps the PSU identity intact,” he says, adding that “before moving ahead, there is a need to do brainstorming with all stakeholders — professionals, experts, researchers, legislators and the rest.” 
The unions of BPCL, in a joint appeal to the company’s Chairman and Managing Director, wrote “…the recent news of disinvestment of government stake in BPCL has shocked us all and we are feeling very insecure about ourselves and our family’s future..” Their appeal includes asking the CMD to ensure that benefits availed by existing workmen, retired workmen, those who have opted for VRS and the legal heirs of the deceased workmen are protected in the event of privatisation.
It’s an appeal that the CMD can do little about. Every owner wants a top management and board of their choice. So a change is inevitable.
According to Mukul Kumar, Convenor of Federation of Oil PSU Officers and Confederation of Maharatna Company Officers’ Association, “Offering management control proves the perception that something is wrong in the way PSUs are run by respective administrative ministries…BPCL is one of the most profitable PSUs, having earned huge profits despite competition from top private companies and multinationals. It has continuously given dividends, with the average per year being 252 per cent in the past five years and average net profit of ₹7,057 crore since the last five years.”
In fact, according to Kumar, “earning profit will become the sole motto of the company and all social service and outreach will be stopped, resulting in closure of unprofitable retail outlets, aviation fuelling stations, depots and terminals.”
Given the current economic situation, the government’s need to generate revenues through share sale of its PSUs is understandable. But a strategic sale of the golden goose may not be the right approach, feels Girish Arya, leader of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and in-charge of Public Sector Employees National Confederation.
Ashwani Mahajan, National Co-Convenor of Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, says the strategic disinvestment of public sector enterprises is not only an imprudent business decision but also against national interest.
Mahajan is of the view that a strategic disinvestment of BPCL is certainly not a good business decision, when the company is regularly reporting profits and the gross refining margins (GRM) of its refineries match the best in the global markets. “What benefit will a strategic investment bring? The example of Hindustan Zinc’s profits multiplying multiple times after its privatisation is a bad example,” he argues.
“The government must look at long-term solutions, instead of falling into the Washington Consensus trap and ‘strategically’ selling the equities to some corporate houses or MNCs,” he says.
One thing is clear — there is a need for larger public deliberation and debate on the methods and timing of offloading government equities as it is not just about money."
3,2019-12-20,BPCL,"Govt may invite EoI for Air India, BPCL stake sale in January 
 The government is likely to invite preliminary bids for stake sale in national carrier Air India and BPCL next month, according to sources.
 The airline is sitting on a debt pile of around ₹58,000 crore, besides huge accumulated losses running into thousands of crores.
“Expression of Interest (EoI) inviting bids for stake sell in BPCL and Air India expected next month,” the sources said.
They, however, added that stake sale in big assets like BPCL will take time as due diligence has to be carried out.
Last month, the Cabinet had approved a strategic divestment of the government’s 53.29 per cent stake in BPCL, along with transfer of certain management control. 
This is excluding BPCL’s equity share holding of 61 per cent stake in Numaligarh Refinery."
2,2019-12-22,BPCL,"Big story: Which stocks to pick in 2020
As we step in to the New Year, there is a feeling of gloom caused by an economy that seems to be spinning out of control, political unrest and equity portfolios smeared with red.
But it needs to be remembered that market bottoms are typically formed when there is an all-pervasive gloom. As mentioned in the piece 'Will stocks recover in 2020?', the ongoing correction that has already lasted two years has created some great buying opportunities for the long-term investor.
While volatility is likely to persist in the next few quarters, investors can use this phase to buy stocks. Here are some themes that can be considered for 2020.
The demand dynamics of the listed stock universe has undergone a sea change over the past five years, with excessive demand for large-cap stocks, which are the top 100 stocks based on market capitalisation. The steady demand limits the downside risks in these stocks, while stocks that have reported decent earnings growth have been accorded rich premium by investors.
The top 100 stocks grew their market cap by 13 per cent in 2019, and the top 10 stocks have witnessed 20 per cent growth. But there is opportunity in this space, too.
While stocks with robust near-term prospects are trading at rich valuations, some cyclical stocks with near-term growth concerns are available at far cheaper prices.
For instance, Power Grid Corporation is trading at a trailing PE multiple of 7.8 times, compared with its three-year average PE of 15.3 times due to lower electricity generation in 2019 and a fear of greater competition going ahead. But considering a large project pipeline, superior execution capability and good revenue visibility, it continues to be a good long-term bet.
Similarly, the infrastructure behemoth, Larsen and Toubro, is currently trading at 20.8 times trailing PE multiple, below its three-year average of 26 times. While the ongoing economic slowdown has impacted the company’s order-book accretion, the growth in its order book is still far superior to its peers. It will also be the first to benefit if the Centre begins its capital spends in earnest.








 
In the same vein, large-cap auto stocks such as Maruti Suzuki India, Eicher Motors and Hero MotoCorp are trading at valuations far below the long-term averages, making it an apt time to begin accumulating them in corrections. With auto majors indicating that the consumer’s intention to buy passenger cars and two-wheelers is improving, and if the BS-VI hump is crossed in March 2020, the prospects can begin to look up.
The base-effect will also aid the earnings of these companies in FY21.
Large-cap metal companies can also be a good hunting ground for value investors with a long-term horizon, with stocks such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Hindalco Industries trading at very attractive valuation.
Buying stocks that are consistent high-dividend payers is another good idea in volatile markets.
There are many PSU listed stocks that have consistently given high dividends to shareholders. Many IT companies are also good at using surplus cash to reward shareholders.








 
Hindustan Zinc is among the most generous dividend payers with an average dividend yield of 7 per cent between 2015 and 2019. Concerns over a fall in production, following the transition to closed mining from open-pit mining and the ongoing US-China trade war, had depressed the stock price. But the sustained deficit in zinc and lead in the global market and the company’s near-monopoly in domestic market, places it on solid ground from a long-term perspective.
BPCL is another good dividend-yield stock, with an average yield of 3.7 per cent over the past five years. But it is recommended only for the more adventurous investors, given the overhang due to the Centre’s resolve to do strategic sale of its stake in the company.
HPCL, another PSU oil-marketing company, can also be considered; the average dividend yield for the stock has been 4.6 per cent over the past five years.
For those who want to take it steady as far as returns go, NTPC is also a good option. The stock had a dividend yield of 5.26 per cent in 2019, and an average yield of 3 per cent over the past five years. It is also a value-buy at this juncture, with its current PE of 7.5 times, far below the three-year average of 11.6 times. Despite a strong project pipeline that will go on stream over the next two years and good revenue visibility, the stock has been hit by the uncertainty surrounding its merger with other PSU entities such as NHPC and SJVN.
If you are one of those constantly on the look-out for new stock-picking ideas, you can scan the portfolios of equity mutual funds to see what the funds have bought in recent times.
Since the fund managers are privy to news that is not always in the public domain, this strategy is quite sound.
We scanned through the stocks added afresh and stocks whose holding was increased substantially by all categories of equity mutual funds between July and November 2019 to look for ideas.
ICICI Lombard General Insurance seems to be a hot favourite across fund categories — dividend-yield funds, large-, mid- and small-cap funds — in this period.
The company’s leadership position in the category, sound prospects and a good business model seem to be attracting fund managers.
Many funds also seem to be looking for bargain buys in the beleaguered auto sector.
Stocks such as TVS Motors, Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors have been favoured by fund managers in the last few months.
Besides some of the recent IPOs, old war horses such as 3M India, Gujarat Fluorochemicals and Astral Poly Technik were other interesting additions by MFs in recent times.
You can keep these on the radar in 2020.
If you are a seasoned investor in the stock market, you will know that in every broad-based sell-off, many fundamentally sound stocks also tend to get punished along with the bad apples.
We screened stocks that had plummeted sharply over the last two years, resulting in sharp de-rating of their valuation, but having a decent operating margin and ROE (return on equity) over the past two years. There are many stocks that seem to have been pushed lower due to the steep valuation they were accorded in happier times. Also, near-term growth concerns, which can prove to be transitory, seem to have played a part in the decline in their stock prices.
Thyrocare Technologies is one such stock whose price declined 23 per cent and the PE multiple corrected 37 per cent to 28.5 times since the beginning of 2018. Due to scarcity premium, this stock had been accorded a steep PE multiple of 55 times in its IPO.
But the stock still has a sound business and healthy financial metrics that hold good promise.
Similarly, the stock of real-estate developer Sobha has declined 35 per cent over the past two years, while its PE has declined 65 per cent, making the stock trade at 11 times the trailing 12-month earnings.
A robust project pipeline, presence in the relatively resilient Bengaluru market and healthy financials place this residential real-estate player in good stead.
Cummins India, manufacturer and distributor of diesel and alternative fuel engines, is another stock that has been de-rated, with its PE multiple correcting 36 per cent in the last two years. While the company has been impacted by the slowdown, it still holds promise for the long term.
Jyothy Labs is another sound stock that has taken a knock in the recent past, taking the valuation to attractive levels.
There were a lot of concerns raised about slowing consumption last year.
But these may be overdone, with the possibility of many of the factors leading to the consumption slowdown easing in a quarter or two. While commercial vehicle sales are linked to the economic activity and could take time to revive, passenger-car and two-wheeler sales are likely to look up in 2020.
Already, an improvement in retail volumes and a favourable monsoon point towards a possible revival.
The Centre is making all efforts to revive the credit growth in banks and NBFCs; this, coupled with an improved transmission of the RBI’s rate cuts, can spur consumption demand for consumer durables as well. Rural income is likely to improve with the sharp increase in food prices since September 2019.
If the Centre and the States resume their capital expenditure in 2020, that can boost rural non-farm income further. While the urban wage growth has been slowing, urban consumption is showing signs of picking up in the last quarter of 2019, as evidenced by consumption of petroleum products, air passenger traffic, auto sales at dealer outlets and demand for office properties. While this space needs close monitoring over the next few quarters, given India’s demographic profile, consumption as a theme will continue to dominate for a few more decades.
It is, therefore, best to keep an eye on the good stocks in auto, real estate and ancillary products such as paints, tiles, plywood, media and consumer durables, to pick up in broader market corrections."
