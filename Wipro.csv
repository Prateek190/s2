JATIN DALAL, CFO, Wipro




JATIN DALAL, CFO, Wipro


India’s third largest software exporter Wipro is confident of returning to industry growth rates but continued to maintain caution, which was reflected in its 0-2 per cent guidance for the third quarter. In the second quarter numbers, the software major is showing signs of getting back on track. Jatin Dalal, CFO, Wipro, spoke to BusinessLine on how it will get back to industry growth despite headwinds in some business areas and the way digital is shaping up for them. Excerpts:


Guidance for the December quarter suggests that growth will remain sluggish. How does this tie-in with Wipro’s stated vision of achieving $15 billion revenue by 2020 with 23 per cent margins?


If you see the trend since the last few quarters, we have been improving the trajectory of our outlook. In this (second) quarter, we have said that we can achieve industry growth this year. Beyond this, we cannot give a forward looking statement. Our confidence comes from the order book we have, client mining initiatives and additionally believe that there is a strong opportunity to gain wallet share in digital as clients look to evaluate vendors. If you plot it, we have made investments along all these areas to achieve the stated goal.


Analysts are not impressed with the guidance for Q3. What are the headwinds you see?


Overall, in a difficult industry, there is still some lumpiness owing to external macroeconomic conditions as well as the transitonary nature of deals. We believe that our recent acquisitions of companies like HealthPlan, Designit, Cooper will help. Already, we have stated that issues in healthcare related to the Affordable Care Act in the US, will start bottoming out after the next quarter.
We already are seeing positivity in banking, financial services and insurance. In energy and utilites, our performance dipped in the quarter due to slower growth from West Asia due to holidays in the region. The business is stable as oil prices have largely remained stable.


Why do you say healthcare will bottom out?


Some senators have signed an agreement to restore about $7 billion in annual payments to health insurers that the Trump administration recently halted. This means that for the next year, people will start enrolment. This would mandate that the people who are covered under Obamacare or others will again have to come under cover and would require IT systems to manage it all. In the past, for example when there is the uncertainty continuing that whether it will get replaced or not and when it will get replaced, clients were hesitant to invest in Obamacare again. Because it is not only the platform that we provide to do it, but customers also have to invest in their IT systems for integrating that with our platform and customers won’t make that investment.


It is a tough environment, and coupled with the kind of intense competition, are margins from traditional services continue to be under pressure?


We look at it differently. There is an uptick in new offering. The old work (of managing ERP software or monitoring technology networks of multinationals) is transforming itself to digital. This transformation will continue for the next few years.


You said that gains from automation have touched 250 customers, 2,500 engineers were redeployed due to automation. Do you have any metrics in mind?


For sure, automation provides a great platform to remain competitive in the market. It changes the software project delivery and transforms the business model of our client.
Now, digital is pervasive across all customers. We help customers design, deliver using different technologies. It is a way a project gets delivered now. Lot of digital growth is coming from transforming existing clients too. It plays a very critical role. One-fourth of our revenues come from digital and these clients will not go back to the old kind of systems. This also comes in with higher project margins. Currently, we use traditional levers like utilisation in combination with automation to help boost margins.


Is digital a part of a client’s discretionary technology spend?


The answer is yes and no. Digital has more discretionary spends. But in a sector like retail, we saw that they not spend in Q3. We can’t ascertain a clear trend line."

Abidali Z Neemuchwala, CEO, Wipro




Abidali Z Neemuchwala, CEO, Wipro


The country’s third largest IT player, Wipro, has made investments worth over $1 billion during the last 18-24 months as it bets on the digital business to revive its growth.
Wipro is looking to match industry growth rates by the fourth quarter of FY18 on the back of better client mining with an increasing contribution from digital and demand across certain business segments. A Wipro spokesperson said that these investments were made during the last 24 months.
Peter Schumacher, CEO of the company’s Value Leadership Group, said developing a deeper understanding of customers and their requirements in the light of economic, end user behaviour and business shifts has never been more important.
In a note to investors, ICICI Securities said Wipro has invested over $1 billion in acquisitions in the last 18 months, with digital now contributing 24.1 per cent to revenues. Early signs on this front are visible with top 10 clients growing at 8.1 per cent YoY in Q2FY18 on top of 1.5 per cent YoY growth in Q1FY18 and after consistent negative growth from Q3FY15 to Q4FY17.
“On the demand side, the management sees strength in the BFSI vertical and stability in demand in the consumer verticals as these two verticals are adopting digital ahead of the industry.”
BV Naidu, Managing Partner, StartupXseedVentures LLP, a former Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) head, said digital is an area where companies across the globe are struggling and Indian outsourcers need to quickly align their services and workforce with the changing needs.
Wipro’s push for digital is resonating across cross-town rival Infosys as well as others such as TCS and Cognizant. Digital contributes in double digits to these companies’ revenues.
While industry watchers seem to be optimistic about the digital push, they are still to be convinced about outsourcing companies’ ability to navigate clients’ expectations. “With digital offerings, IT services companies also need to interact more effectively with their clients’ business teams, move faster, become more agile and take a collaborative approach,” said Schumacher. Taken together these challenges are tough to master for most firms, he added.




The note to the investors said adapting to changing industry trends, the company has embarked on its transformational journey by directing its strategy into six themes — digital, non-linearity, partner eco-system, integrated services, hyper automation and localisation.
On the margin front, Wipro’s IT services EBIT margin has declined from 23-24 per cent range in FY’14 to the approximately 17 per cent range currently on account of subdued growth and acquisitions.
However, with a revival in growth in topline and restructuring in India and West Asia operations, “we expect margins to witness gradual improvement. Wipro reported an IT service EBIT margin of 17.3 per cent in Q2FY18."

India’s third largest IT services company Wipro has reported a 5.5 per cent growth in sequential and 6 per cent rise year-on-year in net profit to ₹2,189.50 crore for the September quarter because of increase in spending from BFSI clients.
The software services company also gave a guidance of $2.01-2.05 billion forecasting a growth of 0-2 per cent for the December quarter (Q3) revenue from IT services which was below street expectations. Wipro’s third quarter outlook has the seasonal impact of furloughs and higher leaves as the US and Europe enters holiday season, the company said.
The company’s consolidated revenues from operations for the second quarter on a q-o-q basis was ₹13,420 crore. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the IT services segment grew 4 per cent to ₹2,280 crore for the September quarter. In dollar terms, the IT services’ revenue grew 2.1 per cent at $2.01 billion. Banking, Financial, Services and Insurance segment grew 27.6 per cent against 26.7 per cent on a sequential basis.
“We surpassed the milestone of $2 billion in quarterly revenues for IT services on the back of rigorous execution of our strategy,” said Abidali Z. Neemuchwala, Chief Executive Officer and Member of the Board.
He said the company will match industry growth rates this year which industry body Nasscom has said will be 7-8 per cent. “Our unique digital capabilities powered growth in top clients and position us well to drive our clients’ digital transformation.”


Digital revenues up


Digital revenues in the quarter contributed 24.1 per cent of revenues, an increase from 17.9 per cent more than a year ago. While performance in energy and utilities dipped in the quarter due to slower growth from West Asia, the company has said that the business is stable as oil prices have largely remained even.
“While the IT services revenue growth was a slight miss with the third quarter guidance, the improvement in EBIT margin was a surprise,” said Urmil Shah, analyst with IDBI Capital.
In the second quarter, Wipro trained 12,000 employees on digital skills. “We now have more than 80,000 technical employees trained on digital pods. Also, Holmes, its automation product, has been used across 250 customers and generated productivity equivalent to 2,500 people,” said Neemuchwala.
In terms of geography, US posted a dip of 0.1 per cent, Europe registered a growth of 1.3 per cent and the APAC and Other Emerging Markets grew 3.4 per cent all on a constant currency basis quarter on quarter.


Client addition


In terms of client addition, 41 clients were added, with 3 client additions happening in the $50million plus. In terms of operational efficiency, the gross utilisation was 72.9 per cent versus 72 per cent in the second quarter. In terms of attrition, the rate was 15.7 per cent versus 15.9 per cent in the first quarter."
129,2018-01-08,Wipro,"Wipro arm buys US-based Cooper in digital push
Wipro Digital, the digital business unit of software major Wipro, has acquired Cooper, a company that provides User Experience (UX), for an undisclosed sum, a move that could strengthen its capabilities in this emerging segment.
Cooper will become part of Designit, Wipro Digital’s strategic design arm. The acquisition strengthens Wipro Digital’s design capabilities, expands its reach in North America and adds capabilities in professional design education, as its customer increasingly look at design as a differentiator for their products or services.
Cooper, which was founded in 2002, counts companies such as Google, Bose, Starbucks and government organisations like NASA, Federal Reserve Bank as some of its clients. “With Cooper, an acknowledged leader and pioneer in the design community with roots on the East and West coast, we will now offer UX and interaction design solutions to our clients and coupled with Designit’s design services and our engineering capability, will allow us to support the digital journey for our clients,” said Rajan Kohli, Global Head and Senior Vice-President, Wipro Digital.


Access to Cooper staff


Wipro Digital and Designit serve clients from 16 offices around the world. With the acquisition, Wipro gets access to 35 employees of Cooper in San Francisco and New York.
India’s third largest software exporter in a statement also said that the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be closed in the third quarter of fiscal 2017-18. This is the second such acquisition that the company has made in the UX segment, after it acquired DesignIT in 2015.
According to Peter Schumacher, CEO, Value Leadership Group, this acquisition will strengthen Wipro’s proposition in digital services.
While Indian engineers have strong technical knowhow, they are not quite adept at designing an experience for a product or service. “Engineers typically are not strong when it comes to right brain thinking, which is reflected in their design capabilities and hence companies acquire this talent from the West,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder, Greyhound Research.
Other IT companies have also been trying to strengthen their UX areas. While cross-town rival Infosys acquired London-based Brilliant Basics, Tech Mahindra bought UK-based company BIO Agency in an all cash deal for £45 million."

The country’s third largest IT services company Wipro posted an 8.4 per cent decline in net profit for the third quarter year on year due to higher costs even as it sees certain customer-specific uncertainties in the near future.
Consolidated net profits came in at ₹1,931.3 crore, a decline of 8.4 per cent when compared to ₹2,109.6 crore in the same period last year. On a sequential basis, there was a dip of 11.6 per cent. Revenue from IT services came in at ₹13,669 crore, which was higher by nearly 2 per cent year on year. EBIT was reported at ₹1,959 crore, a decrease of 14 per cent on a year-on-year basis. The EBIT margin was also under pressure as it went down to 14.58 per cent from 17.3 per cent year-on-year. This was due to a provision of ₹317 crore made because of a client going insolvent.
Wipro said it expected revenue from the IT services’ business to be in the range of $2.03-2.07 billion (in constant currency) or 1-3 per cent for the quarter ending March 31, disappointing some analysts who expected a slightly higher range while Urmil Shah, analyst with IDBI Capital, said the guidance is in line with their expectations.
Abidali Z Neemuchwala, CEO and Member of the Board, said: “We continued to improve our growth trajectory driven by strong momentum in BFSI and uptick in healthcare verticals. This is also reflected in our outlook.”
Part of Wipro’s problems were due to higher costs accrued in its business as one of its clients in the energy and utilities vertical filed for bankruptcy. This, CFO Jatin Dalal attributed, was to the tune of ₹317.5 crore. However, he asserted that this is a one-off incident and that energy and utilities vertical is on a rebound.

BHANUMURTHY BM, President and Chief Operating Officer, Wipro




BHANUMURTHY BM, President and Chief Operating Officer, Wipro


For Wipro, India’s third-largest software exporter, the quarter-ended December was a mixed bag. While it posted a decline in net profits, it believes that the efforts it has put in for the past few years, is starting to look good, notably in digital. Bhanumurthy BM, President and Chief Operating Officer, Wipro, spoke to BusinessLine on the approach the firm is taking to reorient its 1.6 lakh workforce, how digital is trickling across its old and new clients, and on the organisational changes within the company. Excerpts:


In the third quarter, Wipro had faced additional challenges, apart from holidays and furloughs in the US...


There were some headwinds in terms of furloughs and some business headwinds (An energy and utilities customer filed for bankruptcy). If you look at our guidance, it is good. Our bets are paying off. Cloud has grown 25 per cent on a yearly basis and digital contributes 25 per cent of revenues. Also, consumption of cognitive automation is increasing amongst customers. On the other side, our localisation efforts are paying off, with 55 per cent of the US workforce being American citizens. Even though we faced headwinds, our operational efficiencies, demand management, all came together to help us.


You had made some changes after your appointment as COO. In this environment, is the company structure sacrosanct or will there be more changes?


We have to be nimble and agile. Firstly, we eliminated many procedures and processes, and looked at everything from a clients’ lens. For example, the method in which digital projects are executed are different from the ones in the past. Then, we asked ourselves: ‘How do we transform these people in terms of skills?’; 90,000 people have been skilled in digital areas. Even managers have been aligned to new ways of working. We have touched the organisation in terms of project management, skills management, governing these programmes, across all these levels.


So, will a project manager’s role die in the near future?


If you look at the manager role, it will not go away. There are different techniques and methods to manage those projects that will be relevant in the future. You need to be a scrum master, specialise in agile methodology, etc.


Does digital business trickle down to traditional business or, is it independent as of now?


It does trickle. Think of design and think of digital ways of working. Design is a niche and strong capability area with our acquisitions of Designit, Cooper. But the manner in which digital is executed, has to be aligned with design. That is the reason we are transforming the entire organisation into digital. The next piece is that in the run part of services, even that has become digital, with clients wanting it to be delivered that way. Consequently, the run teams have to be prepared for this. Today, it is very hard to be able to have a proposition for either run or change which does not have a digital component.


How margin accretive are digital deals?


It will be hard to quantify at this moment. Digital adoption in clients is reaching a tipping point in terms of size. As adoption increases, the size of the deal increases. It is varies with customers, geography, etc. What is happening is that no conversation is a non-digital conversation.


Are companies getting comfortable with digital deals?


Customers have seen success by being early adopters. They have understood the capabilities of Wipro, and of our service design through acquisitions and investments. Consequently, the confidence has increased.


The acquisitions that Wipro has made involves different cultures, mindsets...


Instead of looking at the differences, we look at the commonalities. One of the checks we do is whether there is a value match from both the entities. We have a style of working and the companies we have acquired or invested in have theirs. The rest of the organisation has to understand the workings from our partners. On the other hand, they (the acquired firms)can learn from Wipro on the ability to scale, capability of getting scale and managing it. We are well versed with that. There are learnings from both the sides.


Are people able to let go of baggages?


It is a work in progress, but Wipro is also changing. Because people work on common projects, people learn from each other."

Wipro Lighting is piloting Li-Fi, which uses light spectrum for LED luminaires to transmit data, in three offices in India. The company has partnered with the Scotland-based pureLi-Fi to design lighting hardware for the Asia Pacific region.
Speaking at the annual Light Show here, Makarand Sainis, Chief Technology Officer – Lighting Business, Wipro Consumer Care & Lighting, said that it will take another year for commercialisation of the technology as they need to develop hardware.
Unlike Wi-Fi that uses radio frequency for transmission that is accessed through a single point, Li-Fi, which can be used only indoors, uses light spectrum and each light-fitting acts as an access point. Because of that the speed is 10 times more than that of Wi-Fi.
“Also the security and safety are better unlike Wi-Fi that is prone to hacking,” says Ramakrishna Puranam, Senior General Manager – Sales. It is safe to use them in accident-prone areas such as flights, hospitals and nuclear power plants, he added.
The technology can now be used only for laptops using a modem. “However, we believe that in the next three-four years, the technology will be inbuilt in laptops and mobile phones and can connect to it just like how you connect to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth,” Sainis added.
Wipro Lighting recently launched smart lighting that is powered by data cables instead of electric wires in partnership with Cisco. “Data cables can carry electricity of close to 60 Watt and can power lights in offices,” Sainis said.
The company worked with Cisco for two years to design the lighting hardware system that can be integrated with the Cisco server in commercial buildings. The advantage is, Sainis said, lights can be switched on or off or dimmed through laptop or mobile app. “Also if the lights are on for a long time, they can send the message to the server for switching off. It is a two-way communication,” he added."

Wipro Lighting has collaborated with leading global technology companies such as Cisco and pureLi-Fi, Scotland, to come up with Internet of Lighting (IoL) solutions for smart and connected indoor and outdoor lighting.
The company showcased a range of digital lighting solutions using IoT and Big Data at ‘LightShow’, in Bengaluru, its signature event to showcase its design, innovation and product capabilities.
With these solutions, the company is looking to tap an addressable market opportunity of ₹7,000-8,000 crore, which is the market size for commercial indoor (offices) and outdoor (smart cities) lighting, said Vineet Agrawal, CEO of Wipro Consumer Care & Lighting.
The company has collaborated with Cisco for Power on Ethernet (PoE) based lighting solutions and human-centric lighting solutions.
It has partnered with pureLi-Fi of Scotland to deliver high speed and secure data transmission through LED luminaires.
“The advantage of PoE, which is used for indoor lighting solutions, is the use of a single cable that powers both the lighting system as well as the lighting control system, reducing cabling cost and time to install. Similarly, the Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) technology which uses the light wave spectrum, frees up Wi-Fi bandwidth and also ensures 100 per cent secure data transmissions,” said Anuj Dhir, Vice-President and Business Head — Commercial Lighting, Wipro.
He said multinational companies are early adopters of Wipro’s IoL solutions in the indoor lighting space and Smart Cities are the early adopters in the outdoor lighting space.
Lighting solutions that enhance user experience, be it energy savings or improved workspace productivity and enhanced employee well-being, were showcased."

The Wipro Consumer Care products division will invest Rs 220 crore to set up a manufacturing facility at Maheshwaram in Rangareddy district. Coming up on 40 acres, the facility will manufacture toilet soaps and other personal care products. It is likely to provide 300 direct jobs and about 200 indirect jobs.
The decision was announced after Telangana Minister for IT and Industries K. T. Rama Rao met Rishad Premji, a Director of Wipro Enterprises, in Hyderabad on the sidelines of the Nasscom India Leadership Forum.
While thanking the Wipro management for preferring Telangana over competing states, Rama Rao suggested that there were many other business opportunities that the conglomerate can explore in the state. Wipro has a huge facility, employing thousands in Cyberabad and was among the first Indian IT biggies to invest in Hyderabad. 
“Wipro has a good presence in the state and its new manufacturing unit will boost the progress of the industrial sector in Telangana."" He urged them to participate in Warangal, which is being promoted for IT companies and Cyient has agreed to invest there, the  Minister said. 
Through TS-iPASS, the industrial policy, the Telangana government has given approval for many mega projects and is aggressively promoting the state as a favoured destination for investors, he added."

 More than a year after its acquisition by Wipro, Appirio’s founding CEO Chris Barbin would be stepping down to take on a new broader role as Global Culture Officer of the parent company. “Earlier this week we (Appirio) announced to our global teams and Appirio customers that I would soon be stepping down as CEO to take on a new broader role as Wipro’s Global Culture Officer (GCO),” Barbin wrote in a blogpost.
He said as Wipro’s GCO, he will be working with the company’s executive team, its board of directors, and a small, dedicated team of change agents to evolve and advance the worker experience at Wipro. “My job as GCO is to make sure our worker experience is just as ahead of the curve and a role model for our clients,” he added.
However, Barbin made it clear that this position is neither another ‘digital transformation’ initiative nor about modernising technology or systems. It is also not “just an HR thing” focused on what new incentives or training programmes the company can put in place, but it is more about how to empower its people and teams across the world to move faster, Barbin said.
Barbin believes the company can create a worker experience and strategic culture that could set Wipro as a benchmark for other large, established companies who are quietly wondering whether or not it is possible to shift culture at scale.
“There are few companies that have proactively evolved their culture and ways of working to continue their leadership, and I can’t wait for Wipro to be on that list,” he said.
Erik Duffield to be Appirio CEO
Filling his shoes starting April 1 at Appirio’s Indianapolis headquarters will be Erik Duffield, currently Appirio’s global general manager of CRM. Duffield has been with Appirio for five years.
“Erik would be taking the reins as of April 1. He is a 5-year Appirio veteran who has been leading our global CRM organisation as General Manager.” “He is a proven industry leader, trusted by employees and customers alike, and embodies the same set of values and cultural philosophies that have been a direct contributor to Appirio’s success over the years,” Barbin said."

Pratik Kumar, CEO, Wipro Infrastructure Engineering


Wipro3D, the additive manufacturing arm of Wipro Infrastructure Engineering, has launched an experience centre for metal 3D printing here. The solutions developed in the centre will be taken to markets across the world.
Launched by the company’s billionaire Chairman Azim Premji, the 12,000 sq ft centre has capabilities such as post-processing, research, characterisation and validation for metal additive manufacturing. 3D printing is a process through which materials are added or solidified to create a 3D object.
Pratik Kumar, CEO, Wipro Infrastructure Engineering, said that based on the confidence developed from its India operations, there are plans to take Wipro3D global.
Established in 2012, Wipro3D has developed a range of end-use applications, and offers additive manufacturing solutions, products and services to industries such as automotive, aerospace, industrial, healthcare, heavy engineering and oil & gas.
For instance, it works with medical device or tools designers and manufacturers, as well as surgeons, to identify the need for special surgical tools and improve the functionality of the component. Surgical devices, neonatal support systems, blood transfusion systems and components of imaging equipment are some examples where additive manufacturing can play a key role.
Similarly, in aerospace, Wipro Infrastructure has a partnership with Israel Aerospace Industries. In 2016, it acquired HR Givon, an Israel-headquartered manufacturer of metallic parts and assemblies for the aerospace industry, which has three manufacturing plants — two in Israel and one in the US.
With its additive engineering expertise, Wipro is able to offer design inputs working with customer’s domain experts that can result in significant improvement in functional effectiveness and ease of use, company executives said. “We see 3D printing or additive manufacturing as a critical component in the digital manufacturing and future proofing strategy of any enterprise,” said Ajay Parikh, Business Head, Wipro3D.
Manufacturing companies are increasingly starting to adopt 3D printing, as they see cost as well as innovation benefits. According to Ritesh Gandotra, Director, Global Document Outsourcing, Xerox India, and Balaji Rajagopalan, Executive Director - Technology, Channels & International Distributor Operations, Xerox India, the rise of 3D printing is likely to lead to reinvention of many old products, as well as the introduction of extraordinary new innovations."

 Wipro will divest its hosted data centre services business to Ensono, an IT services provider, for $405 million, as it seeks to increase its focus on digital.
Further, Wipro and Ensono have also signed a long-term partnership agreement to jointly address the IT requirements of Wipro’s new and existing enterprise customers. As part of the agreement, Wipro will make an investment of $55 million in Ensono’s combined entity. Ensono is a portfolio company of Charlesbank Capital Partners and M/C Partners.
This helps Wipro in unlocking value by transitioning eight data centres and around 900 employees of its hosted data centre services business to Ensono. For Ensono, the acquisition significantly expands its geographic footprint and global service capabilities.
For large and mid-size enterprises, Wipro operates centres globally for over two decades and the hosted data centre services business is one of the three businesses that became a part of Wipro when it acquired Infocrossing in 2007, an acquisition that seems to have not yielded good returns due to increased automation and advances made by cloud computing. 
However, the company clarified that the other two businesses involving medicare and medicaid services in the US health insurance space and ERP implementation services have been integrated with other Wipro businesses and are not part of this divestment. 
“As we embrace our strategy of focussing on newer digital areas of spend, our strategic investment and partnership with Ensono will enable us to continue meeting the hosted data centre services requirements of our customers. This partnership will enhance the global data centre footprint and expand the available talent pool that will give us economies of scale,” said Kiran Desai, Senior Vice-President, Global Infrastructure Services, Wipro.

At around 16/14x FY19/20E earnings, Wipro’s gradual revenue growth alignment (y-o-y) is captured in our view, despite consistent headwinds from various pockets of problems.

 India’s third largest IT services firm Wipro today said it has set up a technology centre in Plano, Texas and plans to ramp up its headcount in the American state to 2,000 people over the next few years.
The centre is focused on developing niche capabilities in new and emerging technologies for Wipro’s clients. The new facility will primarily house Wipro’s US cyber security centre, as well as serve as a hub for advanced analytics, Wipro said in a statement.
“Wipro also plans to ramp up its headcount in Texas to 2,000 over the next few years from 1,400 now,” it added.
In addition to the newly-launched centre in Plano, Wipro has major operations in Dallas and Houston in Texas.
With rising protectionism across markets like the US, Singapore and now Australia, Indian IT companies are adjusting their business models to reduce dependence on visas, hiring more locals instead.
These firms are also setting up newer centres in the US, which accounts for about 60 per cent of India’s IT export basket. Infosys, for example, has said it will set up 4 technology and innovation hubs in the US and hire about 10,000 locals in the US.
To begin with, Wipro’s 45,000-square feet centre will employ 150 people and plans are on the anvil to further increase the workforce at this facility, the company said.
“With more than 1,400 employees in Texas and major operations now in Plano, Dallas and Houston, Wipro is playing an important role in the Texas economy,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said.
Wipro has forged strong relationships with local universities as part of its effort to recruit the best talent. Over the past year, Wipro has recruited 120 graduates from local universities, including the University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas), University of Houston, Rice University, and University of North Texas (UNT).
The company has a 26,000-square feet facility in Houston, which primarily serves as a hub to drive digital business transformation for its clients from the energy sector.
Wipro also plans to develop a digital pod at the Houston facility, where its clients can leverage design thinking to foster innovation.
During the past decade, Wipro has invested over USD 2 billion in the US. The company has over 40 facilities and employs over 13,000 people in the US, with over 55 per cent being locals."

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has found deficiencies in land allotment procedures in Telangana, leaving vast stretches of allotted land untapped for development by IT companies.
“Land allotments were recommended based on applications by the firms. However, no method was prescribed to assess the extent of land actually required by the firms. As a result, IT firms retained or held the allotted land without full development or utilisation,” the CAG said in its report on Telangana finances in 2016-17, released on Thursday.
For one, Infosys did not take up development in 296 acres (Phase II and III) out of the 446 acres allotted in May 2007. Wipro utilised only nine out of the 101 acres at Gopanapally allotted to it in June 2007, leaving 92 acres of the land idle without any development.
“No investments were stipulated in respect of four firms (Brahmani Infratech, Honeywell Technology, Taksheel Solutions and Linus Infotec). Wipro did not invest the amounts proposed by it, indicating lack of commitment. Nanotech failed to bring in any investment,” it pointed out.
The CAG said the government had accepted the audit observations. “They said it was done in order to attract multinational companies. Infosys had submitted its development plans for approval, while Wipro was being served with a show-cause notice calling for its plan,” it said.
The Department did not monitor development of infrastructure by IT firms in respect of land already allotted. The IT firms held the land allotted without development for years."

Wipro has sought shareholder approval to merge four of its entities into the parent company.
In a filing to the stock exchanges, India’s third largest software exporter said that Wipro Technologies Austria, Wipro Information Technology Austria, Newlogic Technologies and Appirio India Cloud Solutions will be merged into Wipro Limited.
Wipro Technologies Austria, Wipro Information Technology Austria and NewLogic Technologies which are part of the NewLogic Technologies group was acquired by Wipro in 2005, are leading semi-conductor design services providers and suppliers of Intellectual Property (IP) cores for wireless and wireline applications. 
NewLogic Technologies owns IPs in this segment which contains software, wireless LAN multi-band radio module and mixed-signal blocks, the company said in a statement. Further, Appirio India Cloud Solutions Private Limited is a cloud application services provider which Wipro acquired.
Wipro said that the rationale behind the consolidation had factored in several reasons. The consolidation will provide access to the intangible assets, licenses and intellectual properties, which will lead to synergies of operations, reduction in overheads including administrative, managerial and other expenditure, operational rationalisation, organisational efficiency and optimal utilisation of resources. 
Further, the combined entity will have a bigger portfolio of services targeted at a larger customer base, which will strengthen its position. 
Also, it said that there will be significant reduction in the multiplicity of legal and regulatory compliances requirements."
89,2018-05-28,Wipro,"Wipro localising more in US: Rishad Premji 
 Indian IT services giant Wipro is localising more in the US and more than half of its workforce in the country now consists of locals, the company’s Chief Strategy Officer Rishad Premji said, asserting that the firm is very committed to the US market. 
Premji, who is a member of the board at Wipro, said Wipro currently has a workforce of over 14,000 employees in the US and 58 per cent of those are locals. Under the Donald Trump administration, there is heightened scrutiny of the H1B work visa programme, which several lawmakers allege is being abused to replace Americans with foreign workers. 
The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries such as India and China. 
Since taking office, Trump has ordered an overhaul of the H1B visa programme to check visa fraud and abuse, and his administration has taken steps to tighten scrutiny of applications, adding to the uncertainty and anxiety of thousands of IT workers on the visas over their future. 
“So we are not a 50-50 company. (The US) still remains one of our largest markets so it’s an area of big focus for growth and I think if you cannot win in the US market, you really won’t win globally,” Premji told PTI in an interview here. 
Premji, who was in the city to address the NASSCOM C-Summit last week, said Wipro is very committed to the US market. Premji is also the chairman of the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM). “We are localizing more, we are hiring on a very structured basis from campus, which has been very very successful,” he said. 
In June last year, Wipro said in a press release that locals formed over 50 per cent of its US workforce. In the first half of last year, Wipro had hired over 1,600 employees by attracting and nurturing local talent to drive innovation and help transform clients’ businesses into digital enterprises . 
During the past decade, Wipro said it has invested over two billion dollars in the US, according to the company press release. The company has been focused on creating jobs in the US, underscoring its strategy to “build a deep reservoir of local talent based out of centers close to its clients”. 
 During FY16-17, over 3,000 locals joined Wipro and the company would continue to recruit from top universities to build on the momentum of hiring locally in the United States, the press release had said. 
Premji added that Wipro has been hiring from campuses in the US for two years now and plans to scale that going forward. Wipro also continues to invest in centres in the US and as part of this, it had last year launched a multi-million dollar Silicon Valley Innovation Centre in Mountain View, California. 
Premji said Wipro also continues to invest from a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) perceptive in the US as well and a big focus for it is to help elevate the quality of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) talent in the US. 
Wipro is working with certain universities that support programmes with teachers who can enhance their own STEM capabilities to then “produce better STEM-educated students in disadvantaged communities, Tier-2 and Tier-3 districts of the US, Premji said. 
“We have a huge amount of commitment to this market, we want to be ingrained in the very natural fibre and fabric of this market and the communities in which we work and live and where our employees work and live,” Premji said."

87,2018-07-17,Wipro,"Big IT companies are no longer high on job-seekers’ list
Once the dream workplaces of software engineers, companies such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra do not feature in the top 10 list for job-seekers.
According to a survey by LinkedIn, new-age companies such as Directi, Flipkart, Paytm and Oyo are favoured by job-seekers in India. LinkedIn has collated this data from a cross-section of industries, jobs and skills that people have searched for on its platform.
Apart from the new-age companies, multinationals such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Anheuser-Busch InBev, KPMG and Ernst & Young complete the top 10 list. Interestingly, not a single Indian software exporter, which was instrumental in building the $167-billion IT industry figures in the top 10.
Industry watchers cite a lack of career growth opportunities, inability to work on projects involving the latest technologies and a regressive corporate culture as reasons that are putting off many job-seekers.
Role preferences
Mohan Lakhamraju, Founder and CEO, Great Learning, said this trend is a reflection of the roles that professionals prefer. While big IT companies have plenty of openings, they still have only a small percentage (of the total jobs) involved in cutting-edge tech, he said. Currently, the top 3 together employ around 8 lakh.
“For technologies like Java, or roles like application maintenance or software testing, people prefer to go to software exporters. On the other hand, for roles such as Data Scientists or Artificial Intelligence (AI), they flock to new-age companies,” said Amandeep Kaur, Founder, Phoenix TalentX Branding, an employer branding company. Others share Peter Drucker’s saying that culture eats strategy for breakfast.
Culture matters
According to Neha Bagaria, Founder and CEO, JobsForHer, an online portal that connects women looking to restart their careers, “Culture matters a lot, and these companies, given their size, have a hierarchy, and people get pigeon-holed in a job role.”
Additionally, new-age companies pay salaries that are at par with software exporters. Typically, entry-level employees get ₹15,000-20,000 per month. “Many a time, start-ups match these salaries and offer additional incentives such as stock options so they can have skin in the game,” added Bagaria.
This also reflects a change in the psyche of job-seekers: in the past, they were more fixated on a brand name, in addition to pressures from the family to work in a ‘stable’ company. Job-seekers are more open to failures, and the stigma associated with failures is fading away, said Kaur.
Some in the industry believe that there will be a mix of new age companies and mature organizations on a job seeker’s radar. While culture, work-life balance, social consciousness are some factors that have moved up the priority list, especially for the younger generation - brand and growth opportunities still remain high on the list for many, said Arjun Pratap, Founder and CEO, EdGE Networks."

82,2018-07-20,Wipro,"BFSI, Americas save the day
Wipro managed to beat its own modest guidance and deliver numbers that were slightly ahead of market expectations in the June quarter. But the results were still way behind what market leader TCS and cross-town rival Infosys delivered.
In the June period, Wipro’s revenues declined by 1.7 per cent sequentially, while peers delivered 0.9-1.6 per cent growth in dollar terms. In constant currency, Wipro’s revenues were up a modest 0.1 per cent in the June period.
While the increase in revenues from the key Americas geography and the BFSI vertical was welcome, there was a decline in Europe and segments such as health business, manufacturing and technology. Large-sized client additions were a mixed bag.
The BFSI segment grew by 1.7 per cent during the quarter, while revenues from the Americas increased by 2.4 per cent. There was a decline of 2-7 per cent in verticals such as health business, manufacturing and technology. Revenues from Europe fell by 6.6 per cent sequentially during the quarter. In constant currency terms, the traction in key verticals were marginally better.
In terms of customer addition, Wipro managed to add one customer in the $50-million category and two in the $10-million bucket. But there was a decrease of four customers in the $20-million category and one in the $75-million band. In contrast, Infosys and TCS managed additions even in the $100-million band.
Thus, even the marginal growth in revenues in constant currency terms appears to be narrowly-led and not broad-based.
The IT industry is likely to grow at 7-9 per cent in FY19, according to trade body Nasscom’s projections. Some peers such as TCS, HCL Technologies and many mid-tier IT players are likely to register double-digit growth, while Infosys is likely to achieve at least the lower end of Nasscom’s guidance.
In this regard, Wipro may grow in mid-single digits, given that in a seasonally strong quarter, its revenues barely grew. Its growth guidance is reasonable at $2,009-$2,049 million for the second quarter, a sequential growth of 0.3-2.3 per cent.
For the foreseeable future, Wipro is likely to trade at a discount to peers. TCS trades at a price-earnings ratio of 28 and Infosys enjoys a valuation multiple of about 19 times trailing earnings. Wipro, on the other hand, trades at 16 times trailing earnings. This valuation discount is likely to persist if not widen over the next year or so."

“The focus should not be on salary but on the roles which are coming up; therefore, we have to look at it from a different context in terms of salary,” he said. The company added that it is replicating its strategy of hiring from the campus in India and training them to be deployed on projects in the US, too."

Our Bureau Wipro surprised market watchers with an increase in net profits on the back of improved performance in the BFSI sector. But it continued to face challenge as it restructures its India/Middle East business and Obamacare-related issues in the US, which was reflected in an uninspiring guidance. 
India’s third largest software exporter reported profits of ₹2,093.6 crore in the first quarter of FY19, a 0.53 per cent rise against the ₹2,082.4 crore posted in the previous year period. Analysts had expected Q1 profit of around ₹1,968 crore.
Revenues came in at ₹13,977.7 crore, up 2.58 per cent (₹13,626.1 crore). The company has given a revenue guidance for its IT services business in the range of $2,009-2,049 million, or a sequential growth of 0.3- 2.3 per cent, excluding the impact of the divestment of its hosted data centre services business, which concluded in the quarter ended June 30, the company said. 
“We continue to see challenges in India business and Obamacare-related issues in the US, which has impacted the healthcare business,” said Abidali Z Neemuchwala, CEO and board member. However, he added that based on the excellent execution by the team, Wipro has seen a pick-up in momentum in its global business ahead of its expectations and delivered a 0.1 per cent growth in constant currency terms, coming in at the top end of its guidance. 
Also, the company which has had some client losses in its energy and utilities business, is seeing some traction in the energy business but continues to see the utilities part under stress, due to regulatory changes and companies embracing technology. But Wipro saw growth in its BFSI vertical, which was the case with TCS too but not in the case with cross-town rival Infosys. 
IT services segment revenue in dollar terms came in at $2,026.5 million, up 1.7 per cent sequentially and 2.8 per cent on a yearly basis. In rupee terms, IT services segment revenue ₹13,700 crore, up 2.2 per cent on a sequential basis and 2.8 per cent on a yearly basis.
In the March-ended quarter, Wipro had guided revenues in the range of minus 2 -0 per cent. The company declared its results after market hours. Further, IT services margin for the quarter was 17.2 per cent.
CFO Jatin Dalal said the company had a good order booking for the quarter but did not disclose the total contract value. Growth which was driven by digital, went up 6.2 per cent sequentially and now contributes 28.1 per cent of its revenues.
Wipro also said that its client mining initiatives has resulted top 10 clients growing 7.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis, added 4 clients in the $50 million revenue bucket.

79,2018-07-27,Wipro,"Firm moves ahead of Wipro in the June quarter
 
HCL Technologies reported numbers that were mostly in line with market expectations. In doing so, the company sailed past Wipro in terms of revenues during the June quarter.
In a seasonally strong period, HCL’s revenues grew by 0.8 per cent sequentially (2.7 per cent in constant currency) in dollar terms. The company’s operating margins remained stable at 19.7 per cent.
TCS (1.6 per cent) and Infosys (0.9 per cent) had reported higher revenue growth during the first quarter, while Wipro’s declined by 1.7 per cent.
Client additions healthy
Incidentally, HCL recorded revenues of $2,055 million during the quarter, while Wipro delivered $2,027 million. If the trend sustains through FY19, HCL would be the third-largest India-listed IT services company, displacing Wipro.
During the June period, HCL added one client in the $100 million category and four in the $50 million bucket, which compares favourably with what Infosys and TCS managed.
But growth was not broad-based for HCL, and was a mixed bag. Revenues from verticals such as financial services, manufacturing and retail witnessed a 1.3-1.6 per cent decline sequentially in constant currency. But technology services, life sciences & healthcare and public services grew at a healthy 3.5-13.4 per cent.








 
Barring TCS, no other top-tier IT company experienced substantially broad-based growth across segments in the June quarter.
Revenues from the Americas grew at a healthy pace (5.9 per cent), while those from Europe fell. The company expects the demand in verticals such as financial services to be robust in the coming quarters, with no specific cause for concern.
Attrition increased a bit to 16.3 per cent. Utilisation was healthy, at 85.5 per cent and the company expects to push it up further, thus aiding margins.
Unjustified discount
HCL has retained its guidance for 9.5-11.5 per cent revenue growth in dollar terms (constant currency) this fiscal. It looks set to achieve near double-digit increase in revenues during the financial year, slightly ahead of trade body Nasscom’s projected industry growth rate of 7-9 per cent in FY19.
But the HCL stock still trades at a little over 14 times trailing earnings, lower than the multiples enjoyed by TCS (27 times), Infosys (19) and Wipro (16).
With healthy June quarter numbers and reasonable full-year guidance, the HCL stock should bridge the valuation gap at least with Wipro."

70,2018-10-23,Wipro,"Wipro (₹309.3): Sell 
Investors with a short-term horizon can sell the stock of Wipro at current levels. The stock was in a medium-term uptrend from the key support level of ₹255 tested in June and until it registered a 52-week high of ₹339 on September 21. However, triggered by negative divergence in the daily indicators and profit-booking at higher levels, the stock changed direction. Since then, the stock has been in a short-term downtrend. While trending down, the stock breached a key support at ₹330 in late September that has turned into a significant resistance now. The stock tested this resistance recently and continued to decline.
On Tuesday, the stock tumbled almost 4 per cent with good volume and has closed below the key support level of ₹313. It hovers below the 21- and 50-day moving averages. The daily relative strength index is on the brink of entering the bearish zone from the neutral region and the weekly RSI is charting lower in the neutral region. Further, the daily price rate of change indicator hovers in the negative territory implying selling interest.
The short-term outlook is bearish for the stock. It can extend the down move and reach the price targets of ₹296.5 and ₹290 in the short term. Traders can sell the stock with a stop-loss at ₹316 level.

69,2018-10-24,Wipro,"Higher expenses drag Wipro’s net down by 14%
Wipro saw nearly a 14 per cent drop in net profit to ₹1,885.7 crore during the second quarter this fiscal on a year-on-year basis. The decline in profits is following due to a revenue loss reported from one its clients but indicated that better performance in financial services’ segment and a good deal pipeline will drive growth for the fiscal. 
Wipro did not name the customer but the impact on client loss was ₹514 crore. Despite the client impact, Wipro improved its margins from 15.6 to 18.1 per cent — a 90 (0.9 per cent) basis points improvement because of strong deal wins during the quarter. 
Sanjeev Hota, AVP Research at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said that the IT major reported better-than-expected constant currency growth and EBIT margin on adjusted basis (excluding the loss incurred from settlement with the customer were on expected lines).
Wipro also gave a revenue guidance from IT services business to be in the range of $2.028- billion to $2.06 billion translating into a sequential growth of 1-3 per cent. 
Abidali Z Neemuchwala, CEO and member of the board, said in the healthcare sector, it continues to see challenges due to the uncertainty from Affordable Care Act in the US.
On a year-on-year basis, revenues grew 8.3 per cent to ₹14,541 crore. On a sequential basis, IT services revenue rose 6.2 per cent. In the quarter, Wipro divested its hosted data centre business. 
The outlook given by Wipro does not include the comparable revenue from its India’s government business. Neemuchwala said that Wipro, as a part of its India business reorganiszation, is carving out the PSU and India government business as they are re-focusing on business coming from areas such as IoT and smart cities in India.
In the quarter, digital revenues went up by 13.4 per cent and now contributes to 31.4 per cent of its business. The company Its added a new client in the $100-million category and seven new clients in the $10-million segment. 
Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer said that utilisation was in excess of 85 per cent, coupled with increasing automation helped in margin improvement.
Wipro also announced the appointment of former SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya to its Board."
68,2018-10-30,Wipro,"IT’s raining jobs! Sept quarter sees hiring spike
The top three Indian IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro — reported a sharp increase in net employee hiring during the September 2018 quarter following good business wins, high employee utilisation and low bench strength. These were the highest hiring numbers for the three companies in the past 12 quarters.
Cognizant, too, saw good hiring during the quarter, but its number was much less than those of its competitors.
Together, the four companies’ net employee hiring was 34,048, nearly five times as many as in the corresponding quarter last year (6,435). In fact, in the September 2017 quarter, both Infosys and Cognizant reported a decline in net hiring (see chart).
Interestingly, the previous high net hiring for TCS, Infosys and Wipro was during the September 2015 quarter (27,045), when the industry was at its peak. However, from then on the industry has seen a decline in growth rates; recruitment numbers too dropped significantly, according to data collated by BusinessLine.
 








 
Over the last couple of years, IT companies have focussed on improving employee utilisation, reducing bench strength and tuning the existing employees in line with the digital transformation they were experiencing, which resulted in lower intake. However, this year they reported large project wins; average employee utilisation onsite reached a peak of around 90 per cent, and offshore around 85 per cent (excluding trainees). They also experienced higher attrition.
“These firms are showing stronger growth in their digital practices, which require new skills, and are therefore adding workers. Each of the firms has been experiencing high levels of attrition — 15-20 per cent — and have to hire afresh. Digital requires a mix shift in skills, which cannot be accomplished only by retraining, and hence there is increased hiring,” Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO, Everest Group, told BusinessLine.
Bozhidar Hristov, Senior Analyst at Technology Business Research, US, said cyclical changes — driven by rising attrition, demand for professionals with skills in new technologies that can not only execute on traditional outsourcing projects but can also drive design-led opportunities — are compelling Indian vendors to hire again.
Further, companies like TCS and Infosys have signed multi-year large-scale outsourcing deals, and additional resources are needed to support their execution, he added.
Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and Managing Director, TCS, said during an interaction with analysts that a substantial part of the hiring during the quarter was made up of local hires, which was the highest net addition that “we’ve done in the last 12 quarters.”"

Buoyed by a billion-dollar plus deal from Alight Solutions, Wipro’s headline numbers came in better than what analysts expected. Yet the software major has given a muted outlook for the next quarter. Bhanumurthy Ballapuram,President and COO spoke to BusinessLine on how organisational restructuring in the last two years is falling into place, looking at good order book for the year and is ready to catch up with its peers. Excerpts
In the first quarter of this fiscal, you said that the West Asia business is getting restructured. In this quarter, you are saying that parts of the India business is undergoing restructuring? What is the rationale and is there more restructuring in the offing?
We have clearly stated that as a part of our restructuring exercise, we are focused on profitable and relevant business. 
In Q1, we said that the West Asia business is undergoing restructuring. This quarter, we have come out and said that the rhythm in India-specific deals is different. So, as a part of our India business, we decided to carve out our solutions for public sector undertakings (PSU)s and government business. 
There will be no change to the rest of our India business.
Do deals take too long in government projects and is that the reason you will be selective in these projects?
No, the deal cycles are different but not necessarily long in government projects. 
Let me categorically state that we will focus on “digital citizen” services that the government is looking to provide. So, areas like IoT and smart cities will be in our radar.
In one of the quarters last fiscal there was a client-specific issue in the energy vertical and in this quarter you have settled with a key client. Are more client-specific issues coming up?
There is a positive momentum and given the demand environment, I expect to have continued positive momentum for the rest of the year. Also, the demand environment for modern application services both in terms of the digital transformation as well as the cloud migrations are really picking up for us. Infrastructure services, has been a very strong performer for us.
You walked away from the customer?
No we settled with the customer.
Coming to your next quarter guidance (1-3 per cent), it is not reflective of your bullishness...
If you see, in Q2, we’ve come at the top end of our guidance in terms of revenue. 
We’ve been able to execute operationally on our levers therefore we’ve improved our margin. 
Going forward, in the third quarter, we are waiting and watching how the enrolments happen in the Affordable Care Act and couple that with lesser working days in the US (holiday season), we are assessing how all these things play out.
Meanwhile, the measures we have taken over the past several years are starting to yield sresults. Our digital revenues now contribute to 31.4 per cent and we have trained 1 lakh employees in this area. 
Utilisation has crossed 85 per cent and automation has gone up from 1.1 to 3 per cent. I think the potential is somewhere between 10 to 15 per cent going forward.
In the backdrop of new proposed visa legislations, how are you positioned?
Currently, 60 per cent of employees in the US are locals and we continue to maintain strong localisation initiatives in Continental Europe and other developed markets."

Wipro has delivered a healthy set of numbers in the third quarter, indicating the pick-up in revenue momentum that started in the September period, which continued in the December quarter as well.
Healthy large-sized client additions, continued improvements in digital revenues and expansion in operating margins are key highlights for the company during the quarter.
In the December period, Wipro’s revenues grew by 1.8 per cent sequentially (2.4 per cent in constant currency) in dollar terms. This growth rate was better than the 0.7 per cent that TCS managed, but lower than Infosys’ figure of 2.2 per cent. Operating margins have risen steadily from the mid-teens over the past few quarters to 19.8 per cent currently, helped by a combination of a weak rupee and higher operational efficiencies.
Wipro’s largest vertical, BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance), which accounts for 31.4 per cent of revenues led the way and grew at a robust 4.7 per cent, sequentially. Other key segments such as communications, health business unit, and energy and utilities grew at 2-3.6 per cent QoQ, indicating broad-based expansion across verticals.
Digital offerings continued to grow at a healthy pace and now account for 33.2 per cent of overall revenues, increasing 6.4 per cent sequentially.
Wipro added one customer in the $100-million category, two in the $50-million bucket and seven in the $20-million category. Revenues from the top 10 clients has increased to 19.7 per cent, up from 19.1 per cent in the previous quarter, as the company consciously mined its existing customer base more.
Wipro has now delivered strongly for two successive quarters. But even as its performance improves, there is quite a bit of catching up to do with peers Infosys and TCS. While TCS is set to deliver double-digit dollar revenue growth for FY19, Infosys has upped its guidance recently and may achieve 9 per cent at the upper end of its projected band.
The Wipro stock may rally in the short-to-medium term, given the good show on the revenue and margin fronts. But any significant re-rating will depend on when the company manages to catch up with the industry growth rate. It trades at about 17 times trailing earnings, at a discount to the multiples that Infosys(21 times) and TCS(24 times) trade at. The gap in valuations may not be bridged in a hurry.
From a broader standpoint, with the three leading players putting up a fine show in a seasonally weak period, the outlook does look much better for the industry."

Wipro reported a strong growth in quarterly profits on account of investments made in automation, and considerably improved its margins in a seasonally weak quarter.
India’s fourth-largest software exporter issued a revenue guidance in the range of 0-2 per cent or $2.04–2.08 billion, which is more or less in line with the street estimates of 1-3 per cent.
Wipro reported a 32 per cent increase in net profit, which beat market expectations and is a reversal from the quarter ended September when it posted a 10 per cent decrease in profitability. The IT services major posted a profit of ₹2,544.4 crore against ₹1,935.9 crore in the year- ago period. On a sequential basis, net profit went up 34.9 per cent.
Revenues for the IT major rose 10% to ₹15,059 crore from ₹13,669 crore. The growth in revenue was aided by its $1.5-billion deal with US-based Alight Solutions LLC.
On a sequential basis, this was a 3.4 per cent growth, higher than its cross town rival Infosys’, which posted a 2.7 per cent growth.
“Our performance was satisfying on both revenue and margin fronts, and as we look ahead, we do not see any immediate impact from the macro headwinds. But we continue to be watchful,” said Abidali Neemuchwala, CEO and Executive Director, Wipro. He was referring to the US government shutdown and a no-deal Brexit, all of which is playing on the minds of corporates in the developed markets.
Margins of the company also saw a significant improvement. They are on the rise over the last two quarters, aided by operating efficiencies and currency headwinds, said CFO Jatin Dalal. The operating margins stood at 19.8 per cent, and in the last two quarters combined, went up by 976 basis points (9.7 per cent). Operating cash flow for the quarter was ₹3,566 crore and the company now has net cash of ₹25,103 crore.
Digital continues to grow and now contributes 33.2 per cent of its revenues.
The company also said it will issue bonus shares: one bonus equity share for every three fully paid-up equity shares held. The same amount of bonus will be available for the stock dividend on American depository receipt, as on the record date, it said.
Besides, Wipro announced an interim dividend of ₹1 per equity share of par value, and ₹2 each to the members of the company. The payment of the interim dividend will be made on or before February 6. Wipro’s shares closed at ₹346 on the BSE."

 Businesses and governments must invest in reskilling the workforce to address anxiety over impending job losses, Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala said on Tuesday.
Speaking at a session here at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting, he said businesses must also improve their ability to assimilate cultures.
To this end, Wipro is recruiting locally everywhere in the world, hiring as many people in the US, for instance, as it typically hires in India, he said.
By 2025, the fifth generation (5G) of mobile telephony technology will be rolled out in 110 countries, bringing unprecedented benefits for consumers, businesses and society, Ken Hu, Deputy Chairman and Rotating Chairman of Huawei Technologies, said at the same panel discussion.

Nokia Corporation CEO Rajeev Suri said evolving technologies will resolve the productivity paradox.
 Citing the example of the US, where the digital economy has enhanced productivity by 2.7 per cent per annum while the physical economy has grown by less than 1 per cent, he surmised that the “tipping point” for the US will be the year 2028.
 Four sectors -- health, transport, energy and manufacturing, which are underpinned by digital networks -- will unleash this wave of productivity, he said.

 Rebuilding trust has to be a collaborative effort by business and government, the panellists agreed.

Wipro Kawasaki is a joint venture between Wipro Infrastructure Engineering, which holds a 49 per cent stake, and Kawasaki with 51 per cent.
The facility, located in Bidadi will begin production in April 2019 doubling the company’scapacity to manufacture hydraulic products to 40,000 units a year.
Pratik Kumar, CEO, Wipro Infrastructure Engineering, said “Rapid growth in infrastructure in India is expected to drive the demand for construction machinery and the new facility helps us cater to the growing demand.”
Kawasaki can respond more flexibly to its customers’ varying production volumes, added Hidehiko Shimamura, General Manager Kawasaki Precision Machinery Division, Japan.
Overall domestic demand for construction machinery has been on the rise due to an expected growth in investment in local infrastructure, such as express ways, railway networks, and ports. With respect to the hydraulic excavator market, medium- to long-term growth is forecast, as annual demand is expected to reach 40,000 to 50,000 units in fiscal 2025. 
Following in the footsteps of China, India is also expected to achieve rapid growth in infrastructure investment.
Wipro Kawasaki first commenced production in December 2012 in a rented facility."

 Wipro on Sunday said it has received approval from majority of its shareholders for the issue of bonus shares and increase in authorised share capital.
 In January, Wipro’s board had approved an issue of bonus shares wherein shareholders will get one bonus share for every three shares held by them.
 In a regulatory filing, Wipro said the resolutions have been approved by members with requisite majority and shall be deemed to have been passed on February 22, 2019, being the last date of receipt of postal ballot forms/e-voting.
Consequently, the company’s authorised share capital stands increased from Rs 1,126.50 crore to Rs 2,526.50 crore by creation of additional 700 crore equity shares of Rs 2 each, it added.
 The filing said the 98.82 per cent votes cast were in favour of increasing the authorised share capital, and 99.81 per cent votes cast were in favour of offering bonus shares.
 In its January filing, Wipro had said the company had an aggregate amount of Rs 46,847.9 crore as on December 2018 in free reserves, securities premium account and capital redemption reserve account."

Credit Suisse downgraded its rating on software services provider Wipro Ltd to ‘under-perform’ from ‘neutral’. It has also cut the company’s target price to Rs 320 from Rs 370.
The company’s shares, which is the top drag on NSE index, has fallen 2.4 per cent to Rs 378.2.
Credit Suisse analysts say while the margin recovery over the last few quarters was creditable, FY18 margins were at a 5-year low and the expansion this year has to be seen in that context. They also believe that there is limited scope for similar margin expansion in FY20 due to higher onsite costs and absence of currency kicker.
“Wipro deserves to trade at a reasonable discount to both Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, given consistently slower growth rates and a lower (and more volatile) margin trajectory,” Credit Suisse said. “Wipro's sales engine has to become more effective so that the growth gap versus peers get bridged to some extent.”
The share closed at Rs 373.55, down Rs 13.65 (-3.53%) on the BSE, and at Rs 374.95, down Rs 12.70 on the NSE."

Wipro has divested its Workday and Cornerstone businesses to Alight Solutions for $110 million.
India’s fourth largest software exporter had bagged a 10-year deal in 2018 from Alight Solutions for $1.5 billion. As a part of the deal —a first of its kind in the Indian IT sector — Wipro will divest both these businesses to Alight Solutions for cash of up to $110 million. Further, out of the $110 million, $100 million would be payable at closing of the deal and the balance $10 million would be a deferred consideration payable at the end of 12 months based on the achievement of performance targets, the company said in a statement.
The deal is expected to close during the quarter ending March 31, 2019.
“This agreement will enable Wipro to sharpen its focus on key offerings wherein it commands a leadership position. We will continue to make significant investments to grow our cloud applications and platforms business,” said Abidali Z. Neemuchwala, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director, Wipro.
In 2016, Wipro acquired the Workday and Cornerstone OnDemand business as part of its Appirio buyout. Workday and Cornerstone OnDemand have multiple customers across the US, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Wipro has delivered 500 Workday engagements and around 3,000 Cornerstone OnDemand projects, the company said.
Wipro also said that it will continue to explore additional strategic opportunities and possible alignment of portfolios with Alight Solutions.
The divestiture agreement will also result in around 350 employees in both teams moving to Alight’s payrolls. The transaction will expand Alight’s capabilities and resources in HCM and financial solutions, with Wipro’s advisory, implementation and integration offerings, the company said.
Further, Wipro will also continue to support Workday’s suite of solutions for application management, testing and integration services for its existing client base. It will go ahead with its investment plans for the cloud applications and platforms space including growing and expanding its Salesforce business under the Appirio brand."

Azim Premji Trust has sold 2.66 crore shares of Wipro in a block deal.
India’s third-largest software exporter sold 2.66 crore shares or 0.44 per cent of the share capital of Wipro, the software major said in a filing to the exchanges. Azim Premji Trust is part of the promoter group that held 336.19 crore shares amounting to 74.30 per cent stake in the company as of the quarter ended December 31, 2018. 
On March 7, Azim Premji Trust had sought pre-clearance for selling equity shares of the company and was granted permission for the proposal on the same day, the filing added. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations mandate pre-clearance from companies for selling their equity shares.
According to bulk deal data with the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), Wipro sold these shares at an average price of ₹256.58 a share. This translates into a deal size of about ₹682 crore. However, the identity of buyer/s is not known immediately. 
This development also needs to be seen in the backdrop of Wipro seeking a nod from SEBI to make a third consecutive buyback offer. Wipro had to get SEBI’s nod as it is in the middle of a scheme of amalgamation of its four-wholly owned subsidiaries with itself. SEBI rules mandate that firms cannot go for a buyback offer when an amalgamation is pending. Currently, the scheme is pending approval at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Wipro sought a waiver as there is a backlog of cases at NCLT.
In a statement to the exchanges, Wipro added that it will make necessary disclosures to the stock exchanges as required under the SEBI Insider Trading Regulations, within the prescribed timelines. Wipro also clarified that the sale of shares is an independent transaction undertaken by the Azim Premji Trust. Azim Premji Trust, along with other promoter entities, has sold its 2.73 per cent stake in Wipro for more than ₹5,700 crore in the recently-concluded buyback offer.

   -  THE HINDU


Wipro Chairman Azim Premji has committed to philanthropy an additional 34 per cent stake in Wipro Ltd belonging to him and valued at ₹52,750 crore ($7.5 billion).
The new commitment is in addition to the 33 per cent Premji had already earmarked for the Azim Premji Foundation, taking the total market value of the philanthropic endowment corpus to ₹1,45,000 crore ($21 billion).
Premji’s total stake in Wipro stands at 74.3 per cent. With the additional commitment, the Foundation now has economic ownership of 67 per cent of Wipro.
What this means is that all the dividends, bonus and other benefits that accrue to the 67 per cent stake will go towards the endowment that supports Premji Foundation’s philanthropic activities.
“Azim Premji, Chairman of Azim Premji Foundation, has announced that he has increased his commitment to philanthropy by irrevocably renouncing more of his personal assets and earmarking them to the endowment that supports the Foundation’s philanthropic activities.
He has done this by additionally earmarking all economic benefits for philanthropic purposes in approximately 34 per cent of the shares in Wipro Ltd currently valued at ₹52,750 crore ($7.5 billion) held by certain entities controlled by him,” a statement from the Foundation said on Wednesday.
Premji’s earlier donations to philanthropy included Wipro’s shares as well as other assets owned by him.
Over the past three years, Premji, through his entities, earned ₹10,115 crore through dividends and share-buybacks from his entire stake in Wipro.
According to the Hurun India Philanthropy List 2018, Premji and his family contributed ₹113 crore last year. Mukesh Ambani topped the list with contributions worth ₹437 crore, followed by Ajay Piramal and family’s ₹200-crore contribution.
Established in 2001, the Azim Premji Foundation works mainly in the area of primary education and supports other not-for-profits working in specific areas through multi-year financial grants.
The Foundation’s extensive fieldwork in education with close partnership with various State governments helps contribute to the improvement of quality and equity of the public schooling system. Its field strategy focusses on scaling up a network of institutions at the district and State levels, to contribute to improvement in the school education system on a continued and sustained basis, the statement said.
The Foundation has also set up the Azim Premji University in Bengaluru that offers various degree programmes and opportunities to conduct research in several fields of human development and social importance.
Over the next several years, the activities of the Foundation are expected to scale up significantly.
The team driving the field work in education is expected to grow significantly from the current 1,600 people, while the university will have 5,000 students with 400 faculty members across multiple programmes. Thereafter, another university in the North may be set up.
The grant-making activities will also continue to expand rapidly, growing three times from its current levels, supporting work across multiple domains of social importance in India, said the statement.
Of Premji’s 74.3 per cent stake in Wipro, 67% is committed to the endowment that supports Premji Foundation’s philanthropic activities. This means all the dividends, bonus and other benefits that accrue to the 67 per cent stake will go towards the endowment

 Wipro has launched an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Centre of Excellence in Kochi to develop solutions for customers in industrial manufacturing, automotive, healthcare and pharmaceutical, consumer products and goods and utilities sectors. 
The lab will leverage artificial intelligence, blockchain and robotics to develop Proofs of Concept and market-ready IoT solutions in an iterative agile development model, a company spokesman said. 
M Sivasankar, IT Secretary, Kerala, who inaugurated the centre, said that Kerala has focussed on technologies that are critical to the ‘Industry 4.0’ concept of which IoT is an integral part. 
Looking to address skill-related issues in emerging technology areas including IIoT, the State is fostering a vibrant hardware-based start-up ecosystem and a skilling framework that connects technical institutions. 
The rollout of the Kerala Fibre Optic Network (KFON), a fibre2home/enterprise/institution network, in the next 18 months will help local economy stakeholders benefit from IIoT deployments. “So, Wipro’s decision to set up its third global IIoT lab in Kerala is a timely one and I hope it grows into a major development centre in a short period of time.”
Earlier, Wipro had hosted a two-day hackathon on Industrial IoT at its Kochi development centre, which saw active participation from leading engineering colleges in Kerala. 
The company will extend pre-placement offers to winning participants in the final year of their engineering degree course while those in the penultimate year of their degree programme will receive internship opportunities. The new hires will join Wipro’s IIoT research and development team in Kochi.
Jayraj Nair, Vice President & Global Head - IoT, Wipro, said that the Industrial IoT Centre of Excellence in Kerala is the third such centre after Mountain View, California, and Bengaluru. 
“Over the years, Kerala has grown into a technology hub that offers access to a dynamic talent pool with an aptitude for new-age technologies,” he said. “IoT presents a huge opportunity for industries in a hyper-connected world and we are confident that our services and offerings will help clients leverage IoT as part of their digital transformation goals.”"
45,2019-03-17,Wipro,"India’s changemakers
When billionaire businessman Azim Premji set a new global-scale gold standard in philanthropy last week, he was also, in effect, nudging India Inc to alter its perspectives — setting aside funds and working in tandem with the country’s social sector innovators. After forking out a total of $21 billion for his Azim Premji Foundation, Premji has catapulted into the very top ranks of global philanthropists with only Bill Gates and Warren Buffett ahead of him. He’s even overtaken billionaire financier George Soros who has bestowed $18 billion on a range of his favourite charitable causes. Premji has focused mainly on the education sector by setting up schools and field institutes to aid government schools in half a dozen States and has also spent heavily on establishing the Azim Premji University on Bengaluru’s outskirts. But Premji does not represent the trend in India Inc. For decades, Indian businessmen have been looked upon as famously stingy, only focusing their charitable efforts in areas of religion and temple-building.
The latest India Philanthropy Report by consulting firm Bain notes that barring a few exceptions, individual philanthropists are contributing two-to-three times below their giving-ability. The Bain report found that CSR budget outlays of domestic corporations and corporate charitable trusts contributions grew by 12 per cent annually between FY2014 and FY2018 while annual funding by individual philanthropists climbed by 21 per cent. The Tatas and the Godrej group have been carrying out good work for decades. A newer entrant into the large-scale giving game is the Shiv Nadar Foundation set up by the HCL Chairman. The Nadar foundation has also been focussing mainly on education. However, the Indian corporate sector is only just waking up when it comes to serious philanthropy. The government hoped to ease this tightfistedness when in 2014 India became a trailblazer with an amendment to the Companies Act, making Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mandatory. Since then, many companies have taken up the cudgel, albeit some more reluctantly than others. It’s now reckoned Indian corporations have spent over ₹50,000 crore on their CSR obligations with a large chunk going into education, healthcare and sanitation. It’s clearly time now for individuals and companies to step up to the plate.
That said, there is a new vibrancy in the social entrepeneurship space. The BusinessLine’s Changemaker awards, also held last week, marked a modest attempt to recognise such social entrepreneurs, who have achieved against immense odds. This year’s winners have brought about a lasting shift in areas such as gay rights, women’s empowerment through education, sports, the rights of sanitation workers and education of tribals in Naxal-dominated areas. Institutional achievements such the creation of the e-NAM network and the GST Council have also been rewarded. A synergy between socially inclined achievers is what this country needs. Subalterns are breaking out of their mould to carve out a life on their terms. Corporate India needs to tune in here."

According to the latest shareholding pattern (March 2019) available with the exchanges, LIC holds 26.52 crore shares or 4.39 per cent stake in Wipro. It may be recalled that last November, the Union Cabinet had approved the sale of ‘enemy shares’ worth ₹3,000 crore that are in the custody of the Ministry of Home Affairs or the Custodian of Enemy Property of India (CEPI).
The enemy property consists of about 6.5 crore shares which are under the custody of CEPI belonging to 20,323 shareholders in 996 companies. Of these, 588 companies are currently functional and 139 are listed on the stock exchanges. Wipro is one among them.
According to the Enemy Property Act, 1968, ‘enemy property’ refers to any property — both movable and immovable properties such as securities, jewellery, land and buildings — that belonged to a person who migrated from India to an enemy country when a war broke out. After the war with China and Pakistan in 1962 and 1965, the government took over the properties, under the Defence of India Act, from persons who migrated to these countries.
In 2017, through an amendment to this Act, vide Section 8A, the CEPI has been empowered for sale of enemy property.
The process for selling these shares was approved by the Alternative Mechanism (AM) under the Chairmanship of the Finance Minister and comprising the Minister of Road Transport and Highways and the Home Minister. The AM was supported by a high-level committee of officers, co-chaired by the Secretary, DIPAM, and Secretary, MHA, that recommends the quantum, price/price-band, principles/mechanisms for sale of shares, etc.
It expects to use the proceeds from the sale for development and social welfare programmes. With the Cabinet rubber-stamping this sale of shares, the disposal of other properties such as land and building could also be in the offing.

After reporting a couple of good quarters, Wipro has once again slipped on the revenue and margin fronts in the March period.
A weak guidance given by the company for the June quarter meant that markets will have little to cheer, apart from the buyback of shares that Wipro announced at a price of up to ₹325 — 15.6 per cent more than the stock’s closing price on Tuesday.
During the fourth quarter, Wipro’s revenues grew 1.4 per cent sequentially (QoQ) in dollar terms.
Peers Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services delivered much stronger results.
Infosys’ revenue grew 2.4 per cent sequentially in dollar terms, while Tata Consultancy Services reported a 2.8 per cent increase in sales.
Operating margin declined by 80 basis points for Wipro and stood at 19 per cent.
However, there were two key positives for the company during the period, in the form of traction in its key verticals and reasonable growth in revenues from the Americas geography. BFSI (banking, financial services, insurance), healthcare and consumer verticals, which together account for nearly 70 per cent of Wipro’s revenues, grew much faster than the company’s rate —1.9-5.6 per cent sequentially in dollar terms.
Sales from the key Americas geography increased 3.1 per cent, but revenue from Europe fell 1.8 per cent.
Customer additions were a mixed bag, too.
While Wipro added three clients in the $75-million category during the quarter and one in the $10-million bucket, there was a reduction in the number of customers in the $20-million band.
Wipro ended FY19 with a revenue growth of 5.4 per cent in constant currency dollar terms. Infosys ended FY19 with a revenue growth of 9 per cent, while TCS finished with 11.7 per cent growth in sales. HCL Technologies, too, is expected to report double-digit revenue growth for 2018-19.
Wipro’s guidance of -1 per cent to 1 per cent sequential growth for the June quarter reinforces the modest outlook for the company .
The company’s operating margin is a good 3-6 percentage points lower than peers, and revenue growth is a little more than half that of its rivals.
While Wipro trades at 18 times its trailing 12 months’ per share earnings, Infosys (21 times) and TCS (25 times) command higher multiples. The company is unlikely to bridge the valuation discount vis-à-vis Infosys and TCS in the foreseeable future."

India’s third-largest software exporter Wipro ended the 2019 fiscal strong, but disappointed industry watchers with an uninspiring negative one per cent guidance. In an interaction with BusinessLine, Abidali Neemuchwala, who took over as CEO of Wipro three years ago, spoke about the ongoing transformation of the IT major, the reasons for the delay of certain projects and how the company is relying less on H1-B visas. Excerpts:
Three years on, is the transformation of Wipro taking longer than expected?
It has been a continued transition for us. We have made a lot of progress — in verticals such as banking and financial services, as well as in segments such as consumer business, energy and utilities. 
We will see an uptick in growth rates of the communications and tech business units this year. 
Our operating metrics, quarter after quarter, have shown consistent improvement across the board. The metrics include utilisation, off-shoring, percentage of work done by bots and attrition rates. This is reflected in our growth in the digital business, which is doing well and accounts for 35 per cent of our revenues. The cyber security business contributes to another 20 per cent. Our cloud business is worth $1.4 billion.
We still have some work to do in manufacturing and healthcare, which we feel could be choppy. In the US, we have grown in the double digits. But in Europe, we have a lot of room to grow. On client mining, in Q4, our top 10 customers continued to post a strong performance, and we added three new customers in the $75-million bucket. On a full-year basis, our top 10 clients grew by 9.6 per cent in reported terms.
Then why the hesitancy in giving a strong guidance?
Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter for us. The outlook also factors in completion of certain large programmes and delayed start of fresh projects in some segments, in spite of a strong order book coming out of the March-ended quarter. 
However, we are confident that our growth trajectory will improve from the second quarter. If we try to chase revenues, then the quality of business will get impacted. 
For building a long-term institution, we have to ensure the right mix of business and growth.
What is causing the delay in projects?
In the banking segment, a couple of deals saw volatility towards the end of last year and beginning of this year. In some other cases, the customer doesn’t immediately sign up for the next project after the completion of the first.
Your active clientele has come down in the last financial year to 1,115 from 1,178...
It is stable, and we see abundant opportunities in newer areas such as digital and cloud, and in all ‘big-bet’ areas. We also disengaged from some clients. In some cases, we were doing work which was not adding much value.
A few quarters back, you said the Indian business is undergoing restructuring. What is the status?
The results will take some time, but the restructuring is on track. We don’t have a timeline for that.
With the high denial rates, will you apply for lesser number of visas?
We continue to invest in localisation across all major markets. In the US, we reached 64 per cent localisation, and now have a well-established campus hiring programme."

FY19 was restructuring year for Wipro where the company went through lot of changes all through the year .The company restructured its segments for better performance whereas exited some businesses (India PSU, data centre business) which was unnecessarily dragging the profitability. This resulted in revenue growth of 7.5 per cent y-o-y and margin expansion of 180 bps for FY19. Going ahead, revenue performance in FY20 looks better than FY19 on the back of order booking in 4QFY19 which is closure to double digit growth.
Even the digital revenue which is growing more than 30 per cent y-o-y is giving some visibility of better growth in FY20. However we expect the growth momentum to gear up more in 2HFY20 as most of the segment barring BFSI, E&U and consumers are seeing challenges in 1HFY20, thus manufacturing (after restructuring done in Europe), communication (investment in 5G) and technology to gear up as the macro environment stables and projects starts to ramp up for the respective verticals.

33,2019-04-19,Wipro,"Wipro says critical business operations unaffected by cyber attack 
 Wipro Ltd on Friday said a cyber attack on few of its employee accounts has not impacted its critical business operations and the firm has taken remedial measures.
In a regulatory filing, the company said it became aware of potentially abnormal activity within its network about 10 days back in respect of few of its employee accounts, who were “subjected to an advanced phishing campaign“.
“Upon learning of the above, the company promptly kicked off its standard operating procedure for addressing such incidents. We began investigating the incident, identified and isolated the employee accounts which were impacted, took remedial steps to contain the incident and mitigate any potential effects of the incident,” Wipro said.
 It also informed the handful of customers where the affected employees are engaged.
 “We would like to clarify that the incident did not impact the company’s ongoing critical business operations,” it said.
 Cybersecurity blog KrebsOnSecurity had previously stated that Wipro’s systems had been breached and were being used to launch attacks against some of its clients.
 “Like any large enterprise, the company investigates over 4.8 million alerts in a year,” Wipro said without elaborating on what its investigation had revealed.
 Wipro said it has used its industry-leading cybersecurity practices and partner ecosystem for remedial steps and has shared this intelligence with its partners to develop the AntiVirus signatures.
 “The same has been applied to our enterprise systems. We are collaborating with our partner ecosystem to collect and monitor advanced threat intelligence for enhancing our security posture. We continue to monitor our enterprise infrastructure at a heightened level of alertness,” it said.
 KrebsOnSecurity, in its blog, had cited sources to state that Wipro was “dealing with a multi-month intrusion from an assumed state-sponsored attacker” and that Wipro’s systems were seen being used as jumping-off points for digital phishing expeditions targeting at least a dozen Wipro customer systems."

A titillating piece of news that crossed our screens not too long ago was that Mrs. Mackenzie Bezos, the ex-wife of Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, will receive $36 billion (about Rs. 2.5 lakh crores) as part of her divorce settlement. She has now stopped the wagging tongues by signing the ‘The Giving Pledge.’ This is a commitment by the signatories to give away to charity at least half of their fortunes that was started by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett in 2010. Gates has been pursuing his philanthropic goals as assiduously as the business goals he pursued when he ran Microsoft. People like Mark Zuckerberg and Nandan Nilekani are also part of this club which has taken charity to new heights.
Education attracts many charitable donors. Our own Azim Premji of Wipro, also a signatory, has given away the bulk of his donations to education including the eponymous university and improving government run schools. Premji is probably one of the few remaining who adheres to the Gandhian standard of trusteeship, where one thinks of one’s possessions beyond one’s need as being held in trust for society. He has even referred to trusteeship as a motivating factor during random published interviews in the past.
A sensation was created recently when Robert Smith, an African-American business magnate and a pledge signatory, announced during the commencement speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta, US, that he would be paying off the student loans of the graduating class so they begin a career debt free. This announcement is expected to cost him about $ 40 million (about Rs. 276 crores). The news came as a shock to the audience who cheered him wildly. He may justifiably see it as giving back to his community. Mr. Smith is listed as the richest African-American in the US and the college largely serves that community.
What also prompted his generosity is undoubtedly the high levels of debt that US students carry when they graduate. It is a burden that lingers on for many years as it builds up while students earn and pay off in bits. The cost of higher education in the US (whether private or public universities) has over the years risen much faster than the rate of inflation. The cost per year for tuition, board and lodging at Morehouse is estimated at $40,000 (about Rs. 28 lakhs), and it is not among the more expensive institutions. Many candidates mention it as a burning issue at election time and then seem to be able to do little aside from some fringe relief. Whether higher education should be so expensive in the first place is a separate issue that seems to attract little attention.
There are many ways in which philanthropies fund education. The most common is through naming universities, buildings, classrooms and so on all of which carries varied levels of pricing. Others create foundations to fund research and the production of new knowledge.
But not all were very pleased by Mr. Smith’s dramatic contribution. Parents who took loans to pay student bills now thought they had made a mistake. Students who struggled and worked rather than taken a loan or tried to minimize their loan reflected on their decision. And most of all, those who are in the class graduating next year wondered if they will also get lucky. They probably should not change their financing strategies as yet.
It is estimated that there are over 44 million borrowers who together owe about $1.5 trillion (about Rs. 104 lakh crores). Student debt is also ranked as the second highest debt category, second only to mortgage loans and even ahead of credit card debt. Empowering people with education is widely believed to be the way to creating productive citizens. Putting a load of debt on the citizen’s back is a capitalist society’s way of keeping you working hard to repay that debt.

 IT major Wipro on Wednesday said its ADS holders can participate in a Rs 10,500 crore-buyback programme by becoming direct shareholders prior to the record date of June 21. Earlier this week, Wipro had announced June 21 as the record date for its buyback programme.
“In order for a holder of ADS’ (American Depositary Shares) to participate in the buyback, such holder will need to become a direct shareholder of the company prior to the record date,” Wipro said in a BSE filing.
It further stated that “to have the chance to become a direct shareholder of the company prior to the record date”, holders will need to submit their ADS’ for cancellation and withdraw the underlying equity shares before noon of June 17, 2019.
The company’s American Depositary Shares (ADS), each representing one equity share, are traded in the US on the New York Stock Exchange.
Wipro said its board and shareholders have approved the proposal to buy back up to 32.3 crore shares at a price of Rs 325 apiece on a proportionate basis through the tender offer process.
The buyback size constitutes 23.03 per cent of the aggregate of fully paid-up equity share capital and free reserves of the company according to its audited standalone balance sheet as on March 31, 2019, it added.

Wipro’s outgoing Chairman Azim Premji said he is confident that the future of Wipro will “far outshine anything that we have done before.”
In a letter to employees, Premji said that Rishad Premji, who will take over from July 31, is firmly rooted in the values that are the bedrock of the company. “His commitment to the spirit of Wipro is absolute. His diverse and cross-industry experiences give him the benefit of a broad view of global business.”
He also said that Rishad brings to this role new ways of thinking, experience, and competence that will lead Wipro to greater heights. “He has been an integral part of the leadership team since 2007 and has an intimate understanding of our company – from operations to strategy. He has a deep knowledge of the global technology industry and was until recently the Chairman of the trade body NASSCOM, where he helped chart the course of India’s $170-billion software industry in this era of digital transformation.”
Premji also pointed out that Rishad will continue to serve on the Board of the Azim Premji Foundation, the philanthropic organisation, which now owns 67 per cent of the economic interest of Wipro Ltd. Thus, in his new role, he will also represent the largest stakeholder of Wipro.
With Abidali Neemuchwala taking over as the Managing Director of Wipro, he said that Abidali and Rishad will make an excellent leadership team. Azim Premji said the company has been an exemplar of a successful, ethical and a socially responsible organisation.
In the letter , Rishad Premji said he feels a deep sense of humility and a surge of energy as he takes over the role of Executive Chairman of Wipro.
“The greatest strength of Wipro is our people. Our commitment and continued focus on our clients powered by deep technology prowess is at the heart of our success. Humble in success and resilient in adversity is our character.”
Rishad Premji said that over the past four years, Abidali and he have worked closely together, and that he has a lot of respect for his strong strategic and operational depth and his sincerity in leading the company. He said Premji has demonstrated that a successful business can be built on an ethical foundation and driven by social purpose.
Neemuchwala said Rishad Premji’s considerable global experience, deep understanding of the technology landscape, ability to see the big picture, work ethic, strong values, empathetic nature and leadership skills are characteristics “I have personally come to admire and respect and are widely acknowledged by all those who know him.”
He said one of the greatest privileges of his life has been to work with Azim Premji. His extraordinary leadership of Wipro for over 50 years, his pioneering role in the global IT industry, and his unique contribution by demonstrating that businesses can be successful while being committed to integrity, have made him a legend, he said."

“I wish to thank generations of Wiproites and their families for their contribution towards building our company to what it is today. I am grateful to our clients, partners and other stakeholders who have reposed trust and confidence in us,” Premji said in a statement.
The soft-spoken, Harvard-educated, 42-year-old Rishad, Chief Strategy Officer and member of the board, will take over as the Executive Chairman for a five-year term. Wipro Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director, Abidail Z Neemuchwala, has been re-designated as MD & CEO.
Azim Premji will continue to be on the board as a non-executive director and founder-chairman. He will also remain the Chairman of Wipro Enterprises Ltd and continue to chair the board of Wipro-GE Healthcare.
“Rishad’s understanding of the global technology industry, strong strategic orientation and diverse leadership experience make him the right person to guide Wipro. He is also best positioned to represent the interests and fundamental social purpose of the largest shareholder of Wipro. I have great confidence and trust in Rishad’s leadership to steer Wipro in its next phase of growth as we move forward,” Premji said.
“I am humbled and honoured to be invited to chair the board of Wipro Ltd, a company that has over decades demonstrated that success can be built on the foundation of strong values and uncompromising integrity. This is a testament to the spirit and dedication of thousands of Wiproites,” Chairman-designate Rishad Premji said.
Premji,73, who led the company for 53 years, is widely known as one of the greatest businessmen-philanthropists of the modern era. In March, he announced that all earnings from approximately 34 per cent shares of Wipro Ltd worth about ₹52,750 crore ($7.5 billion) would be transferred to the endowment that supports the Azim Premji Foundation. This took his total commitment to ₹1.45 lakh crore ($21 billion), making it one of the five largest private endowments in the world, and the biggest in Asia.
“Premji’s unflinching commitment to values makes him an exemplar of how business and ethics can, and must go, together. His exceptional generosity makes him one of the greatest philanthropists of our time,” said Ashok S Ganguly, Independent Director and Chairman, Board Governance, Nomination and Compensation Committee, Wipro Ltd.
“My best wishes to Azim, his successor and Wipro,” said NR Narayana Murthy, co-founder and former Chairman of Infosys Ltd."

From a small vegetable oil company worth $2 million to a diverse business conglomerate worth $11 billion in a span of just over 50 years is only one part of his long and fruitful journey. He would always be know as a large-hearted person who donated as much as two-thirds of his wealth to charitable causes, a very rare virtue for any businessmen in today’s intensely competitive world.
If what your peers, competitors and employees say about you is any barometer of your success then Azim Premji has definitely achieved much. Though Rishad Premji has assumed many roles like chief strategy officer of Wipro to heading Nasscom, maintaining the high standards set by his father and steering Wipro to next level would be challenging to say the least.

ATM charges
The decision of the RBI to reduce the repo rate to 5.75 per cent is certainly welcome as it will give the required boost to the slowing economy. Banks should pass on the benefit to the ultimate consumers otherwise there is no point in increasing the credit outflow from banks through quantitative measures. Drastic steps such as demonetisation implemented by the Modi regime could not give the required impetus for growth promotion, in fact it affected the growth on several fronts. While appreciating the RBI in waiving off charges on RTGS and NEFT transfers, the central bank should not contemplate increasing charges on ATM transactions. It should be noted that as small savers’ money is mostly invested in banks, no move should be made to hike ATM charges as it will hurt their interests.

Dhoni glove row
The familiar idiom is ‘wearing your patriotism on your sleeve’. On a lighter note, MS Dhoni wears patriotism on his wicket-keeping gloves. This is not to undervalue his love for the country and the services in any manner. The ICC’s diktat to the famed cricketer to remove the army insignia sported by him during the India-South Africa match has caused a furore in India.
The clamour for BCCI to flex its muscles and force the ICC to reverse its decision is growing louder. It is hardly surprising it is made an emotional issue in the present time when nationalist sentiment is running high.
We all admire Dhoni, popularly known as Mr Cool, for his batting and wicket-keeping skills, leadership qualities and patriotic credentials. But that we are all his big fans does not necessarily mean that we don’t have the option of saying that he should go by the rule-book. The rule clearly states that no other logo other than a manufacturer’s is allowed on equipment and clothing while playing ICC matches. All those who see nothing wrong in Dhoni sporting the insignia can say in justification that it is not a commercial endorsement.
While it is true that Dhoni is an Honorary Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army, he is not in the playing field in that capacity, but as an international cricket player.
An internationalist — a player who takes part in a sports competition against another country — is supposed to promote internationalism. Sportspersons should continue to play the vital role of uniting all nations by a sense of common humanity even while achieving national glory for their nations.

Rishad Premji




Rishad Premji


 Rishad Premji, 42, who took over as the new executive chairman of Wipro Ltd on Wednesday, has quite a task on hand to steer the company to some healthy numbers over the next few years.
The transfer of the baton was quite low-key but his father, Azim Premji as the non-executive director and as founder-chairman, will be around to help Rishad navigate through the initial period. 
Rishad Premji ‘s elevation was welcomed by the street with the stock price up 2 per cent to end the day at ₹270.5 on the BSE. 
Rishad Premji has been well-groomed over the years to take over the mantle. He joined the company as a business manager in 2007 and in 2015, he was inducted into the board. A graduate from Harvard Business School, Premji has handled treasury and investor relations giving him exposure to consulting, finance, treasury and operations. He became the company’s chief strategy officer in 2010 reporting to the CEO and headed the $100-million venture fund. 
Before joining Wipro, Rishad Premji worked with Bain & Company in London and with GE Capital in the US. He was recognised as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum for his outstanding leadership, professional accomplishments, and commitment to society in 2014. Along with Premji, Abidali Neemuchwala has also taken over as the new managing director of the IT major.
Analysts haven’t responded well to the previous quarter numbers of Wipro with margins sliding for the IT services for the second straight quarter. The operating margin has fallen to 16.6 per cent. Net profit decreased by 3.9 per cent to ₹2,328 crore for the first quarter this fiscal on a sequential basis while revenues fell 2.4 per cent to ₹14,786 crore for the same period. 
HDFC Securities in its note to the investors said Wipro is struggling to grow (plus 2.9 per cent YoY in FY’19) whereas larger peers are clocking double-digit growth rate. BFSI, which was the key revenue driver for Wipro is witnessing slowdown. Issues such as completion of large projects (consumer), delay in decision making (BFSI, manufacturing) and deferral in the ramp-up of large projects are impacting growth. 
“The soft guidance for 2QFY20 indicates that the lag is entrenched. Margin expansion is difficult and the buyback trade is over. Wipro has underperformed in last three months ( minus 8 per cent vs NIFTY IT minus 3 per cent) and the trend will continue unless growth revives,” the note said. 
Prabhudas Liladhar in its note to the investors said the company should try to reduce focus to fewer verticals and eliminate the ones where it has lost scale and edge. It said IT companies will have to invest in digital and people to participate in a strong demand environment. “Wipro’s management aggressive cost rationalisation keeps us sceptical about their participation in the demand environment and hence will restrict their revenue momentum.”"

 Leading soap manufacturers have slashed prices on their products following lower palm oil prices to tackle muted growth in the sector.
 Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has reduced the prices of its popular soap brands– Lux and Lifebuoy – last month.
 “HUL does selective and judicious price changes across its portfolio in the normal course of its business. Given that the commodity prices are expected to remain benign for certain time period, we have taken price reductions in range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent in Lux and Lifebuoy portfolio, while it may be higher on certain packs in order to pass on the benefits to the consumers,” HUL said in a statement.
 Wipro Consumer Care, makers of Santoor soap, has also slashed the prices.
 “...we have also cut prices in soaps, passing on the benefit of lower raw material prices to the consumer. We believe this will help increase consumption,” said Wipro Consumer Care president (India consumer care business) Anil Chugh.
 Kolkata-based multi-conglomerate ITC also cut prices due to lower raw material cost about 5-6 weeks back.
 “ITC passed on the benefit of lower raw material costs to consumers through a downward revision in prices about 5-6 weeks back in certain packs of its soap variants,” said an ITC spokesperson.
 Data analytics firm Nielsen, in a report, had last month said that in April-June quarter, sales of FMCG items, including soaps, have slowed down.
 “... this quarter has witnessed a slowdown across all food as well as non-food categories with Salty Snacks, Biscuits, Spices, Toilet Soaps, and Packaged tea leading the slowdown,” Nielsen had said."

 Markets regulator SEBI has settled a case with an individual for alleged delay in making requisite disclosures regarding her shareholding in Wipro.
The watchdog has settled the matter with one Kumudha Sridharan on payment of a little over Rs 5 lakh towards settlement charges.
A SEBI probe had prima facie revealed that Kumudha Sridharan had on two occasions delayed making the disclosures as required under the PIT (Prohibition of Insider Trading) norms with respect to change in her shareholding in Wipro.
Kumudha Sridharan had approached SEBI to settle the case “without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusions of law”.
 “The proposed proceedings that could have been initiated for the defaults ... are settled qua the applicant (Sridharan),” the regulator said in an order dated August 30.
SEBI noted that it would have the right to take enforcement actions, if it finds that any representation made by the applicant is subsequently discovered to be untrue."

 Wipro Ltd has secured a strategic seven-year engagement, valued at $300 million, from ICICI Bank to provide a comprehensive suite of services. 
“This engagement will further strengthen our endeavour to provide differentiated technology and digital capabilities to the financial services industry,” a Wipro statement said.
Currently, IT services company Vara lnfotech provides these services to ICICI Bank. As part of the latest deal, Wipro will absorb about 3,800 employees of Vara lnfotech along with its existing contracts, facilities and assets, on a going-concern basis, through a business transfer agreement for an all-cash consideration of ₹321 crore. 
The revenue generated by this business in FY19 stood at ₹221.5 crore, said Wipro. The latest transaction is expected to be completed during the quarter ending September 30, and is subject to customary closing conditions, it added."
14,2019-09-05,Wipro,"‘No big deal’: Analysts not warm to Wipro-ICICI Bank deal
Analysts said that while Wipro’s $300-million deal with ICICI Bank is a large deal, it is still a low profitability business. 
Wipro on Wednesday announced a seven-year deal with ICICI Bank for a total contract value of $300 million. The deal is expected to start delivering revenues from this month itself. As part of this strategic engagement, Wipro will absorb about 3,800 employees of Vara lnfotech along with its existing contracts, facilities and assets. 
“We see this deal to be similar to the people takeover deals that have gained prominence in the sector over the recent years. It provides revenue visibility of 0.2 per cent of Wipro’s FY20E revenues and 0.4 per cent bps on annualised basis,” said Emkay global in a note to investors.
It said that while margin details have not been shared, the margins for this business will certainly be dilutive to Wipro’s native IT Services margins, given the low revenue productivity of Vara lnfotech’s business ($8.3k for Vara vs $47.3k for Wipro). Vara Infotech had revenues of ₹200 crore in FY19. Vara Infotech used to provide BPO, App Services and Infra support to ICICI bank. 
Wipro plans to leverage its Automation platform Wipro Holmes to derive synergies out of this deal. “We believe that Wipro’s relative under performance is here to stay in FY20E as sectoral weakness can possibly drive a growth moderation in its Financial Services vertical, where the company did well in FY19 (up 16 per cent YoY in CC terms). Wipro’s large buybacks (7 per cent in FY18 and 5.5 per cent in FY19) have so far supported its stock price.
HDFC Securities in its note said that Wipro is struggling to grow whereas larger peers are clocking double-digit growth rate. BFSI, which was the key revenue driver for Wipro is in slowdown. Issues such as completion of large projects (consumer), delay in decision making (BFSI, Manufacturing) and deferral in ramp-up of large projects is impacting growth. 
The guidance for Q2 in FY20 indicates that the lag is entrenched. Margin expansion is difficult and the buyback trade is over. Wipro has underperformed in the last three months (-8 per cent vs NIFTY IT -3 per cent) and the trend will continue unless growth revives, the note said. 
BOB Capital Markets in its note said that despite several strategic interventions, Wipro has underperformed its tier-I IT service peers in terms of revenues and earnings over the past seven years. Regulatory uncertainty for the healthcare business, restructuring of India and Middle East operations, and a muted outlook for the BFSI and manufacturing verticals cloud recovery prospects.
Wipro’s shares were flat at ₹255.55 at the close of trading on Thursday."

10,2019-09-23,Wipro,"Corporate tax cuts: Stocks that gain the most
Earnings growth for India Inc, which has been on first gear in recent times, is all set to receive a boost from lower tax outgo, with the reduced corporate tax rates. For many manufacturing companies, the savings on this front could give them room to reduce prices or improve other spends, thereby spurring demand. Many companies in sectors such as infrastructure, capital goods and FMCG stand to gain. Some others in the auto, steel, oil and gas, and real-estate segments could also get a leg-up. IT companies may be better off under the current regime though, given the lower tax incidence at present.
Most companies in the information technology space will not be enthused by the corporate tax rate cuts announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. There are two reasons. Many companies have an effective corporate tax rate below 25.17 per cent (including surcharge and cess) and they get the benefit of profit-based deductions for exporting their services from special economic zones in India.
Also, IT and software companies that build their own intellectual property get a weighted deduction under the income-tax laws on the R&D expenses that they have incurred to build their IP.
Now, such companies might have to pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) calculated on their book profits.
The Finance Minister has slashed MAT from 18.5 per cent to 15 per cent. That puts the effective tax rate, including surcharge, for companies paying MAT at 17.5 per cent compared with 21.6 per cent earlier.
This means that IT companies that get tax deductions on their export revenues earned from operating in SEZs, and pay MAT, wouldn’t want to opt out of claiming these deductions. They would also have to forego the weighted deduction on R&D that brings down the effective corporate tax rate.
Besides, if they opt for the lower effective corporate tax rate of 25.2 per cent, they will have to take a one-time charge of any MAT credit that might be in their books.
In 2018-19, out of the top-tier IT companies in the S&P BSE IT Index, only Infosys (26 per cent) had an effective tax rate of over 25 per cent at the standalone level, while TCS (21.3 per cent), HCL Technologies (23.7 per cent), Wipro (23.02 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (19.6 per cent) had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
Even most mid-tier IT companies such as Mphasis (20.5 per cent), Hexaware (22.3 per cent), Mindtree (24.9 per cent), L&T Infotech (21.7 per cent) and L&T Technology Services (24.2 per cent), had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
In all, IT companies won’t be rushing to opt out of their export-based tax incentives until the benefit of paying lower taxes on export revenues runs out.
With major players such as Hindustan Unilever, Nestle, Britannia, GSK Consumer and Colgate-Palmolive suffering an effective tax of 32-36 per cent, the FMCG segment could be a beneficiary of the new 25.17 per cent tax rate.
At the same time, home-grown companies such as Dabur, Jyothy Labs, Godrej Consumer, Bajaj Consumer and Marico may not choose to move to the new regime, considering that their effective tax rates are either on a par with or lower than 25.17 per cent.
Overall, for shareholders in FMCG stocks, this move could result in the 2018-19 profits of listed FMCG players, on an aggregate, inching up by 9 per cent.
However, FMCG companies can choose to retain a portion of the benefits to increase advertising spends and/or pass it on as price cuts to boost demand. In the quarter-ended June 2019, for instance, major FMCG companies clocked single-digit growth in sales due to poor volumes.
Going by the 2018-19 numbers, Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motors and Maruti Suzuki and Eicher Motors have an effective tax rate of 29-33 per cent and could benefit from the reduced rates. However, the rates of Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland, are much lower. Taking M&M ‘s reported tax expenses (standalone) for 2018-19, the effective tax rate is only at 24.17 per cent (21.3 per cent, considering the current year's tax expense alone).
The company also has a MAT credit of ₹1,116.35 crore in its books as on March 31, 2019. Ashok Leyland’s effective tax rate, given the reported tax expense for 2018-19, is 20.6 per cent (15.14 per cent taking the current year's expense alone). The company has availed itself of benefit to the extent of ₹233 crore on tax concessions and tax holidays in 2018-19 and has MAT credit on its books.
In such cases, companies may choose to continue under the current regime till the tax holiday/concessions exist. Since MAT also continues at a reduced rate of 15 per cent, these companies can choose to pay tax as per normal rates or as per MAT, whichever is higher — as has been the case until now. MAT credit can also be set off against the tax liability in future years.
Among auto ancillaries, MNC players such as SKF India, Goodyear and Bosch that have high effective tax rates of 33-36 per cent could be major beneficiaries. Put together, listed companies in the auto and auto ancillaries space may see a 3-5 per cent addition to their profits of 2018-19, if they choose to avail themselves of the 25.17 per cent tax rate.
For infrastructure companies, the effective tax rates in FY19, after taking into account all eligible exemptions and tax holidays, work out to 27-35 per cent of their standalone PBT. For companies such as Engineers India, Ircon International, Ashoka Buildcon and RITES, availing themselves of the lower tax rate of 25.17 per cent could translate to a 14-18 per cent jump in earnings, going forward. Whereas, giants such as Larsen & Toubro and IRB Infra developers could witness only a 2 and 5 per cent rise in PAT led by tax savings.
Among the pure construction players, NCC, Welspun and Sadhbav Engg could benefit. Certain companies have effective tax rates of less than 25 per cent, which can be on account of payment of minimum alternate tax, or availing themselves of benefits of differential depreciation on fixed assets under the IT Act. The effects of the amendments announced will hence have to be evaluated on a case-to-case basis.
For instance, Dilip Buildcon has an effective tax rate of 16 per cent in FY19 on account of MAT provisions (inferred from the annual report). Hence, the lowered MAT rates could bring down its effective tax rate further, and the company would also get the existing MAT credit entitlement.
On the other hand, Adani Port and SEZ now enjoy an effective tax rate of 21 per cent, after availing itself of deductions under Section 80IAB of the Income Tax Act for 10 years, with effect from FY07-08. This apart, it has several subsidiaries and joint ventures that can get tax holiday benefits under Section 80IA.
The company is also likely to benefit from the grandfathering of taxes on buyback, as the management had made a public announcement of the share buyback of ₹1,960 crore on June 4, 2019.
Among the cement manufacturers, the effective tax rate in FY19 for most companies (on a standalone basis) is less than 25 per cent — they may refrain from foregoing their exemptions and deductions. This includes large players like Ultratech and Shree Cement. However, there could be savings in PAT in the range of 11-15 per cent for Himadri, Deccan and India Cements if they opt for the subsidised rates, as their current effective tax rate is more than 25.17 per cent.
The impact of the lower corporate tax on the steel industry is expected to be mixed, at least in the near future.
The tax incidence on companies such as Tata Steel, Kalyani Steels and Jindal Stainless Hisar in FY19 was 39 per cent, 33 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively. Note that these are the tax rates after taking into account the tax exemptions that the companies are eligible for. Thus, these companies stand to gain in a big way if they opt for the reduced tax rate of 22 per cent (25.17 per cent including surcharge and cess).
Companies such as JSW Steel and Tata Metaliks with effective tax rates of 20 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, may not opt for the reduced tax rate immediately. Meanwhile, SAIL, Jindal Steel and Uttam Galva had zero current tax for FY19. This could be either due to companies making losses in FY19 or accumulated losses from previous years, setting off the year’s profits. If the new reduced tax rate is opted, setting-off of losses will not be possible, making it unattractive. However, in the long run, when the companies turn profitable or become eligible to pay MAT, they can opt for the new tax rates, which could reduce their tax outgo.
The move to reduce corporate tax seems largely positive for real-estate companies reeling under pressure due to tight liquidity in the market. For most realty companies, the effective tax rate is higher than 25.17 per cent (including cess and surcharge), based on standalone profit before tax. For instance, for Oberoi Realty and Ashiana Housing, the current tax rate is 29 per cent, while for Kolte-Patil, it works out to around 45 per cent.
These companies, if they adopt the new corporate tax regime, could improve their earnings, even if they forego their exemptions and MAT credit.
If players pass on the benefit to home buyers, it could spur demand in the market.
But for companies such as Sunteck Realty and Prestige Estate Properties, for which the effective current year tax rates work out to less than 5 per cent, and Brigade Enterprises and Sobha with 23 per cent rate, continuing with the existing tax structure may be better.
For the oil and gas sector, the cut in corporate tax rate seems largely positive. Going by their FY19 standalone financials, the effective tax rate for most companies in the sector is higher than the 25.17 per cent rate (including surcharge and cess) that will apply to them now. For instance, in FY19, the current tax provision of city gas distributors Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas was about 31 per cent of their profit before tax.
The effective tax rate for the PSU hydrocarbon explorers, ONGC and Oil India, and gas transmitter GAIL (India) was 27-28 per cent, while it was about 29 per cent for PSU refiner HPCL. The highest tax rate — about 32 per cent — was borne by Gujarat-based gas transmitter GSPL. For the above companies, the new tax rate of 22 per cent plus surcharge of 10 per cent and cess of 4 per cent — totalling 25.17 per cent — should translate into lower tax outgo. Even if these companies have to give up some investment-based tax exemptions and credit of minimum alternate tax carried forward from earlier years, they should be better off under the new tax rate regime.
On the other hand, there are a few companies such as Reliance Industries, PSU refiners Indian Oil and BPCL, and gas importer Petronet LNG that may not benefit from the new tax rate. In FY19, the current tax provision of Reliance Industries, Indian Oil and BPCL was about 20 per cent of their profit before tax — this is lower than the new effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
It is the same case for Petronet LNG, which had an effective tax rate of about 24 per cent last year. For these companies, it may be worthwhile continuing with their existing tax structure, taking the benefits, if any, of investment-based tax exemptions, and carried forward MAT credit and carried forward loss.
In the case of Reliance Industries, for instance, while the applicable tax rate in FY19 was 34.94 per cent, it was able to reduce the effective rate (excluding deferred tax adjustments) to about 20 per cent, thanks to exempted income, and additional allowances net of MAT credit.
The company may likely find it more beneficial to continue with this arrangement until the tax breaks that keep the effective tax low are exhausted.
Later, it could shift to the new regime with the effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman opened the liquidity tap for corporates on Friday by announcing a sharp tax cut and leaving more money in their hands for capacity expansion. The statutory tax rate for corporates has been lowered to 22 per cent from 30 per cent. This benefit, though, is only for companies that wish to give up their tax exemptions. Given that most tax incentives and exemptions have been phased out over the past few years, companies may prefer to forego the few they enjoy now, and opt to be taxed at the lower rate of 22 per cent.
New manufacturing companies incorporated after October 1, 2019, can benefit from an even lower rate of 15 per cent tax if they don’t claim the tax benefits they are eligible for. India Inc will also get relief on MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax). The Finance Minister has reduced MAT to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent. This would benefit companies located in SEZ developers, infrastructure, cement companies, companies with units in specified locations in the North-East and exporters. There is also relief on buyback tax.
The 20 per cent tax on buybacks by corporates, which was announced in the Budget on July 5, 2019, would not apply to companies that announced them before the Budget day. According to data from nseinfobase.com, companies, including Sasken Technologies, Greaves Cotton, Welspun Corp, Star Cement and Eris Lifesciences, whose issues are on the way, but were announced before July 5, and for companies such as Infosys, which had buybacks ongoing in July, will benefit from the change. Wipro is also set to benefit as it announced its buyback on June 5.
Companies that pay corporate taxes under the new rates of 15 and 22 per cent will be charged a flat surcharge of 10 per cent, irrespective of their taxable income. The companies that choose the existing regime, availing exemptions and deductions, will have to pay a surcharge only if their total income exceeds ₹1 crore. The rates of surcharge for them will continue to be at 7 per cent and 12 per cent, for total income between ₹1 crore and ₹10 crore and more than ₹10 crore, respectively.
The stock market on Friday cheered the Finance Minister’s move to cut taxes. While companies that are currently paying lower rates due to various deductions and exemptions, such as many information technology players, are unlikely to shift to the new regime, there are many companies across sectors that are likely to see their tax incidence move lower, thus translating to higher profits. If the lower tax incidence is passed on to customers in the form of price cuts, it can help spur demand.
 








 
Ever since the late Finance Minister Arun Jaitley kick-started the process of a phased reduction in corporate tax in 2016-17 and elimination of exemptions, the effective tax rate for India Inc has only gone up.
This is because, while smaller companies were given the benefit of a lower tax rate each year, the phasing out of some tax deductions began impacting the tax outgo of larger companies.
Further, in 2015-16, the Finance Minister also increased the surcharge on corporate tax. That year, for companies with income of up to ₹10 crore, the surcharge was increased to 7 per cent from 5 per cent, and for firms with income above ₹10 crore, it was increased to 12 per cent from 10 per cent. Thus, the effective tax rate in 2017-18 came to 29.49 per cent; it was 23.22 per cent in 2013-14. This increase — evident in the numbers of the past one year — was due to larger companies coughing up more.
In 2017-18, the effective tax rate for companies making profit of more than ₹500 crore was 26.3 per cent; in 2016-17, it was 23.94 per cent. The effective tax rate for smaller companies making profit of ₹1-10 crore came down to 27.38 per cent from 29.2 per cent. So far, withdrawal of tax exemptions has made the effective tax rate of larger companies move higher. It is from here on that these companies will start benefiting.
Now, all companies that are willing to give up their tax incentives can pay taxes at a fairly lower rate of 22 per cent.
 
India is now among the countries that have a low corporate tax rate, and can compete better globally. For the current year, KPMG data show that the statutory tax rate in Myanmar is 25 per cent; in Malaysia, it is 24 per cent; 25 per cent in Indonesia and Korea and 28 per cent in Sri Lanka. Even Chinese companies cough up more — as they pay a tax of 25 per cent — and in Brazil, it is 34 per cent.
The global average corporate tax rate is 23.79 now, and the Asian average is 21.09 per cent. That said, the current move to cut taxes is going to make a hole in the government’s tax kitty. Last year, as per the Budget estimates, the revenue foregone by the Centre on various tax incentives was ₹1.08-lakh crore. Now, with tax cuts, there will be an additional revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore.
 
Bond investors who have been basking in the double-digit return glory over the past year may be in for a bumpy ride ahead. While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s corporate tax rate cut has cheered India Inc and the equity market, the move is a dampener for bond markets.
This is because the revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore owing to the cut will throw the Centre’s fiscal deficit target off track. The RBI’s surplus transfer to the Centre, at best, makes up for the existing shortfall in income tax and GST collections. While higher proceeds from disinvestment and some tax buoyancy (towards the end of the fiscal), on account of the growth-boosting measures, can aid revenues, for now, the ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue loss appears to have left a big hole in the Centre’s kitty. The fiscal deficit target could well move up to 4 per cent (from the projected 3.3 per cent), implying additional borrowings.
Based on the Controller General of Accounts’ (CGA) provisional figures for FY19 (in which income tax grew by a modest 7 per cent), the estimated growth in income tax collections for FY20 works out to 23 per cent. For April-July, CGA data suggest that the growth in net income tax was just about 6 per cent. There is also a significant shortfall in GST collections.
The surplus transfer by the RBI as recommended by the Bimal Jalan Committee has offered a much-needed respite to the Centre in the current fiscal. Excluding the ₹28,000-crore interim dividend already paid by the RBI to the Centre last fiscal, the net transfer in the current financial year amounts to ₹1,48,051 crore. But while optically, the surplus transfer appears to be a massive figure, essentially, it is about ₹60,000 crore above what was estimated in the Budget. Hence, this additional bonanza can help make good the shortfall in tax revenues.
On the disinvestment front, the Centre has set a target of ₹1.05-lakh crore (above the ₹85,000 crore achieved the previous year), which may be achievable. But given that the Centre has been missing its target on spectrum, it is unlikely to meet its estimate of ₹50,500 crore for FY20.
On balance, before the corporate tax rate cut, the Centre could have still pulled off the 3.3 per cent (risk of missing GDP growth assumptions though remained). The substantial ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue foregone on account of the corporate tax rate cut is an additional burden for the Centre that can take its fiscal deficit target to 4 per cent levels.
The joker in the pack is still the underlying growth in the economy. While the real GDP growth has fallen from 8 per cent last year to 5 per cent this fiscal in the April-June quarter, the sharp fall in nominal GDP growth from 12.6 per cent to 8 per cent during this period is worrisome.
The Centre’s fiscal deficit target assumes a 11 per cent growth in nominal GDP growth for FY20 (from the Central Statistics Office’s FY19 estimates), which is a tall task. If growth falters further, the fiscal deficit target can even move beyond 4 per cent levels.
The biggest overhang for Indian bond markets has been the huge gross market borrowings by the Centre pegged at a high ₹7.1-lakh crore in the current fiscal (from ₹5.71-lakh crore last year). But given that the borrowing calendar has been front-loaded, the market was factoring in the easing of supply of bonds in the second half of the fiscal.
For the April-September 2019 period, issuance of government securities amounts to ₹4.42-lakh crore; the balance ₹2.68-lakh crore of gross borrowings will come in the second half. But the supply of bonds in the second half could go up now. The stimulus announced by the Centre would lead to additional borrowings, which implies more supply of bonds and higher yields (bond prices and yields are inversely related).
Going ahead with the foreign sovereign bond issuance could be a saving grace. The ₹70,000-odd crore of foreign sovereign bonds pegged in by most economists can help lower bond yields in the domestic market.
Even though the RBI cut its policy repo rate by a notable 35 basis points in its August policy, Indian bond yields have only inched up. From 6.3 per cent levels in the beginning of August, the yield on 10-year government bonds has increased to 6.6 per cent levels, already factoring in expectations of a fiscal stimulus from the Centre. Post the FM’s move on corporate tax rate, the yield has moved up by another 20 basis points.
Given that expectations of fiscal slippage has been factored into bond yields to some extent, bond yields could remain range-bound in the near term, until there is more clarity on foreign sovereign bond issuance, GST collections and the disinvestment agenda. Expectations of the RBI cutting rates further, given the sanguine inflation trends, may also cap the upside in bond yields. That said, notable rise in yields cannot be ruled out in the coming months, given the significant slip on fiscal deficit and volatile rupee.
Given the uncertainty around various factors impacting bond yields, investors must cap their expectations and tread with caution. Long-term gilt funds as a category has delivered 15-16 per cent returns over the past year, thanks to the sharp rise in bond prices. A rise in yield (fall in prices) hereon can impact returns.
Hence, investors should avoid duration and credit risk in their portfolio. A chunk of your debt fund investments should be in short-term debt funds that carry less volatility in returns. Short- and medium-duration debt funds having a duration of up to 3-4 years are ideal for investors with medium risk appetite. Opt for corporate bond funds that invest a chunk of their assets in high-rated debt instruments."

12,2019-09-26,Wipro,"Wipro to collaborate with IISc
IT major Wipro is collaborating with Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, to develop ‘driverless cars’ and build the country’s first indigenous ‘Metal 3D printing (additive manufacturing) machine’.
Azim Premji, founder of Wipro, delivering the convocation address at the IISc, said “We have immense gratitude towards your wonderful institution. This is our birthplace. Let me thank you – all of you who are here and the generations that have built IISc.”
“I am also happy to note that our association has continued over the past 40 years — we have continued to recruit from your institution and do collaborative projects at the cutting edge of technology; it is here we are collaborating to develop ‘driverless cars’ and build the country’s first indigenous ‘Metal 3D printing (additive manufacturing) machine.’
By associating with IISc, Premji said, “I think that there are two lessons in our association with the great institution. The first one is that collaboration matters more than we realise. We must encourage and foster collaboration across different sectors — across education and research institutions, industry, civil society and government.”
The second lesson, he said, is the role and contribution of good and open-minded institutions in society, which cannot be measured in money terms. They have far-reaching and deep impact. “We must build more such institutions, which pursue excellence in their chosen fields — and are deeply engaged with society. IISc is an excellent example of this — but we have too few such institutions in India, we must build many more.”
Recalling Wipro’s old association with IISc, Premji said, “in 1979, Wipro approached the newly set up Centre for Scientific and Industry Consultancy at IISc for a consulting project. We had just set up our information technology division, having decided to diversity into IT.
“The institute constituted a committee to advise us on what computer we should make. This consulting priejct involved surveying literature on the computers being made all over the world. And it was also a platform for technical discussions, conceptualisation and design review between Wirpo’s R&D team and IISc. It was here that we began to think about what chips, bus and microprocessor should be used in the first Wipro computer,” he said.
On the technology transfers and expertise, Wipro chairman said IISc helped build R&D manpower of Wipro. “Victor Jayakaran, the first employee of our IT division, was an M tech student of IISc and was hired to anchor the project in its initial stages. Sridhar Mitta, from ECIL, joined us soon after. In the first few months of their joining they worked out of the digital lab of IISc.”
However, there is something that is even more fundamental than the pursuit of excellence that shapes the institutions and their contributions. This most fundamental of things is the values of the institutions, he said. “And when I mention values, I mean what is lived and practised every day in institutions, not merely what is professed.”
Premji cited three values that he believed were critical to a good institution and its contributions to the world, namely integrity, empathy and humaneness, and third, fairness, equity and justice."

8,2019-10-01,Wipro,"Q2 outlook: Infosys, TCS set to perform better 
Infosys and TCS are expected to put up a good performance during the second quarter results while Wipro might come out with weak revenue growth.
Analysts tracking the domestic IT sector said EBIT margin is expected to decline for all companies except Wipro on a year-on-year basis because of increase in US cost structure, investments to grow a digital business and transition costs in large deals.
In an interview with BusinessLine, Cognizant CEO, Brian Humphries said while the IT sector growth will remain robust in the coming years, most of the market is rapidly shifting to digital. “The overall numbers are changing and within those pillars, the traditional business is either flat to slightly declining while the digital business is growing 10 to 12 per cent,” Humphries said.

But analysts pointed out that the slowdown in BFS spending and client-specific challenges are soft spots. “Revenue growth will be mixed and driven by seasonal strength and client-specific challenges,” Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to its investors said.
Kotak said it forecasts 3.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth for Infosys with 60 basis points contribution from Stater acquisition. It said strong revenue growth in Infosys will be aided by the ramp-up of large deals and broad-based strength across verticals. It said there could be a 2.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter revenue growth for TCS with challenges in financial services and retail verticals. But despite a seasonally strong quarter, Wipro is likely to disappoint with 1.2 per cent quarter on quarter revenue growth for the September 2019 quarter.
Revenue growth for HCL will be powered by the completion of the acquisition of select IBM products. Underlying organic growth will likely be weak at 0.7 per cent QoQ due to productivity commitments in large IMS projects and relatively high base of the previous quarter. We expect modest growth of 1.7 per cent in Tech Mahindra with weak growth in the enterprise segment. Hexaware will lead revenue growth in mid-tier companies helped by consolidation of Mobiquity acquisition."
7,2019-10-05,Wipro,"Wipro completes acquisition of US-based ITI 
 IT major Wipro on Friday said it has completed the acquisition of US-based International TechneGroup Incorporated (ITI).

 “The said acquisition has been completed on October 3, 2019,” Wipro said in a regulatory filing to BSE.
Founded in 1983 and headquartered in Ohio, US, ITI has offices in the UK, Italy, Israel and Germany. It is privately held and had 130 employees as of March 2019. Its revenue stood at $23.2 million in FY18 (year ending June 30).
Wipro had earlier said that the acquisition would allow the Bengaluru-based company to offer end-to-end solutions in digital engineering and manufacturing."

Abidali Z Neemuchwala, the CEO and MD, Wipro


IT major Wipro beat market estimates to record a 6.9 per cent increase in net profit during the second quarter on a sequential basis to ₹2,550 crore aided by an increase in revenue growth, lower taxes and higher other income.
Wipro’s IT services business grew at a mere 0.5 per cent to $2.04 billion on a sequential basis. The company’s net profit on a year-on-year (YoY) shot up by 35 per cent largely because of a one-time impact of a specific expense during the Q2 of the previous year because of which the operating margin was at 15 per cent. On a quarter on quarter (QoQ) basis, revenues grew 2.3 per cent to ₹15,130 crore while on a YoY, it grew 4 per cent. IT services’ operating margin for the quarter grew 3.1 per cent YoY to 18.1 per cent.
The revenue guidance for December quarter was at $2.06 billion - $2.1 billion, which translates to a sequential growth of 0.8-2.8 per cent on a constant currency basis, beating analyst expectations. “We had good in-quarter execution on both revenues and margins considering the slow start to the fiscal,” said Abidali Z Neemuchwala, the CEO and MD of the company. He said the operating margin of 18.1 per cent in Q2 compared with 18.4 per cent during the previous quarter was due to the absorption of the incremental impact of wage hike for two months and investing in bench for growth.
The top executive at Wipro said that in digital, revenues grow 7 per cent QoQ on a constant currency and 29 per cent YoY and now contributes 39.6 per cent of its revenues.
US market grew at 9.4 per cent YoY in constant currency while Europe is weak because of the capital market and banking sector. “We continue to see a robust pipeline and the momentum of the order book in Q2 has been better than Q1. India and the Middle East restructuring is on track and is reflected in some of the deals that we announced like ICICI,” said Neemuchwala.
He said that the overall growth was broad-based with 6 out of 7 industry verticals growing on a YoY basis. The company signed a large deal in India aligned to its strategy of taking global offerings to India customers.
The company’s voluntary quarterly annualised attrition rate dropped from 17.9 per cent to 16 per cent. “We continue to drive localisation in the US where our local workforce is 67.8 per cent of the total US employee strength.”
Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer, said: “We delivered operating margins in a tight range after absorbing the impact of two months of the wage hike. Growth remains our priority,” he said.
EPS for the quarter was ₹4.3 per share and grew 36.7 per cent YoY. Wipro’s shares ended the day nearly flat at ₹243.70 on the BSE."
4,2019-10-15,Wipro,"Q2 earnings: Wipro holds its ground in difficult times


 
Wipro managed to grow its revenues and meet its quarterly guidance thanks to its US business that helped mitigate the deceleration in Europe and other regions.
Wipro, the third among India’s top tier IT services companies, posted a 6.6 per cent rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,561 crore compared to the June quarter despite a hike in salaries during the quarter. The company’s IT services earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins came in at 18.1 per cent (down 30 bps) during the quarter ended September.
In dollar terms, the company posted revenues of $ 2.05 billion, rising 0.5 per cent QoQ. This is despite slowing growth in revenues from Europe. Wipro’s dollar revenues were within its guidance for the quarter ($2.04 billion – $2.08 billion). In constant currency terms though, revenues grew 1 per cent sequentially. The management guided revenues for October-December quarter in the range of $2.07 billion – $2.11 billion, which builds in sequential growth in the range of 0.8 - 2.8 per cent.


The company has managed to arrest the rise in attrition, which is down to 16 per cent in annualized terms during the quarter. This would help it arrest any spike in sub-contracting costs, which have been flat for three consecutive quarters. It added net 6,603 employees during the quarter.


Revenues grew 2.8 per cent QoQ to Rs 15,126 crore helped by manufacturing, technology, consumer and energy natural resources & utilities business units. Revenue from the company’s mainstay--banking, financial services and insurance--business unit fell nearly 1 per cent during the quarter. This business unit makes up for nearly one-third of Wipro’s consolidated revenues.
Revenue from communications segment fell 2.6 per cent compared to the September quarter while the health segment fell 0.7 per cent sequentially.
The management indicated that some large projects did not come on stream, which crimped revenue growth during the quarter a little bit. It has been a decent pipeline of projects and has signed a large seven-year deal with ICICI Bank during the quarter worth $300 million.


Growth in Europe seems to have been stymied by the larger macro-economic weakness in the continent. Revenues from European clients fell 4 per cent sequentially during the quarter. Growth in US revenues helped the company make up for negative revenue growth in Europe. Revenues from US rose 2 per cent sequentially. Revenues from other geographies, which includes emerging markets, saw a deceleration of nearly 31 per cent.

India’s top three IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro — have significantly increased their net employee hiring in the September quarter compared with the previous quarter. The three companies together hired 28,157 employees (net) compared with 16,687 in the first quarter, an increase of 59 per cent.
The increased hiring comes in the backdrop of better business forecast. The hiring, which started to decline from the third quarter of last year, started to gain traction in the first quarter of this fiscal. In the second quarter, it rose further.
Industry leader TCS saw the highest hiring in the September quarter, breaking its own record. The company’s net addition of 14,097 employees was the highest ever in a quarter — breaking the previous record of 12,356 employees set in Q1.
 










 
Sanjeev Hota, Head of Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said: “IT companies see good demand environment going ahead. Deal wins have been robust in the last few quarters. Localisation initiatives in key geographies is also driving recruitment.”
“Our order-book and deal pipeline are very well distributed across verticals and geographies, which gives us confidence from a medium- to long-term perspective,” Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and MD, TCS, told financial analysts while discussing the company’s second-quarter results last week.
“We have been building capacity and gearing up for growth. Our investments in organic talent development continue to help us build up unmatched scale and depth in new technologies. As of September 30, we have trained over 3,22,000 employees in emerging technologies and over 3,91,000 employees in agile methodologies,” V Ramakrishnan, CFO, TCS, added.
Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys, said that the company delivered another strong quarter in Q2, and the performance was robust across multiple domains. The company reported double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter; strong growth in digital; improvement in operational parameters, especially employees utilisation and onsite-offshore mix; large deal signings; and reduction in attrition.
“The hiring is consistent with what we have done in the past. So I do not see any material change to that. Our hiring will be dependent on the growth and we have already factored that in the guidance,” said Pravin Rao, Chief Operating Officer, Infosys."
6,2019-10-16,Wipro,"Wipro Q3 results preview: Muted revenue growth likely


With TCS and Infosys results out of the way, it is the turn of another IT major Wipro to announce the second quarter results which it will do so Tuesday with the analysts sounding a note of caution stating that the Bengaluru headquartered company might come out with weak revenue growth. 
Analysts tracking the company said they expect Wipro to guide for 0 - 2 per cent revenue growth for December 2019 quarter and expect growth to be impacted by cautious spending of Europe banking and capital market clients. 
""We expect constant currency revenue growth of 1.2 per cent and cross-currency headwind of 70 bps on a QoQ basis. We expect weak growth from the financial services vertical and steady growth in others, a note from Kotak Institutional Equities said.
It said the full quarter impact of wage revision is likely to lead to a decline in EBIT margin. Reported EBIT margin is expected to increase by 324 bps on YoY comparison mainly on account of 360 bps impact from the settlement of a lawsuit with National Grid in Sep 2018 quarter.
Completion of buyback in September will impact treasury income. ""We note that the company has extinguished 5.5 per cent of the equity as part of the buyback program. We expect Wipro to guide for 0-2 revenue growth for December 2019 quarter and expect growth to be impacted by cautious spending of Europe banking and capital market clients, Kotak said in a note to its investors. 
It said it expects investor focus on (1) outlook for the key growth driver of FY2019 viz financial services vertical, (2) sustainability of margin in light of muted growth, and (3) benefit from the cut in corporate tax rate by Indian Government."

 Rich Indians should try to devote a portion of their wealth for the society and public good, urged Azim Premji, Chairman of Wipro.
“Mahatma Gandhi’s idea that wealth should be for the people and there must be a trusteeship to it is something I believed in very strongly. There is just so much a family or an individual can consume,” said Premji after receiving the MMA Amalgamations Business Leadership Award 2019, instituted in memory of S Anantharamakrishnan, Founder Chairman of Amalgamations Pvt Ltd. He also delivered the Anantharamakrishnan Memorial Lecture.
“Ultimately, if people are very wealthy, they have to have certain trusteeship for that wealth and use it for public good. This is very important. I would endure everyone here with massive wealth to be willing to devote a substantial part of that for the public good,” he added. 
“Everyone has a duty to contribute to the society. Practice of moral leadership will help in this, and will also help in business. We need to work together to develop the India that we have envisioned in our Constitution, an idea that is equitable, humane and sustainable,” he added.
“The success of Wipro is not my success, but of the many people in leadership and in the levels below leadership who have devoted their lives and commitments for the success. The same applies to the foundation [Azim Premji Foundation]. The kind of devotion and sacrifices of the people are really outstanding. It is far beyond the compliments that you people gave me today. It was my mother and Mahatma Gandhi who influenced my thinking and action on what to do with the privilege of my wealth,” he added.
“The more I do, the more I realise how much more complex doing philanthropy is when compared to running a business. Issues are much more subtle; convictions are much more difficult to drive home and incentives that you give to people is not in money but in recognition... Our success in business has taught us many things. But on social issues, we have to start all afresh,” he added.
“In my last 20 years of work in education, the teachers who are often blamed in the government for being careless and for dereliction of duty, are the most committed people I have come across,” he said.
Mallika Srinivasan, Chairman, Tractors and Farm Equipment Ltd, emphasised the role played by nation builders like Anantharamakrishnan (her grandfather) in building an industrial India. She also outlined the objectives and legacy of the MMA-Amalgamations Business Leadership Award, the importance of ethics and value in modelling institutions of excellence and the exemplary life of Premji.
A Krishnamoorthy, Chairman, Amalgamations Pvt Ltd, read the citation and gave the award to Premji.
