The crowds come to see the cars and bikes and what the future holds for the roads. From that perspective, the big story of the 14th edition of the Auto Expo was green mobility, with over 50 electric vehicles on show. The other big story was Kia Motors roaring into India, wooing consumers by inviting them to take selfies with brand ambassador Rafael Nadal (no, he was not there – just some trick photography) and crowdsourcing names for its first car in India.
But from a marketing perspective, making an impact at Auto Expo 2018 which kicked off on February 8 at Greater Noida was Tata Motors’ new corporate brand positioning of Connecting Aspirations.
Unifying identity
It came together beautifully at its sprawling pavilion with the theme of Smart Mobility, Smart Cities that painted a future of electric vehicles and a green commuting ecosystem.
The storytelling and thought behind the branding and theme was a refreshing change from its rather clumsy ‘Made Of Great’ campaign in the previous edition. But then it’s the group’s 150th year, and it also fits into the grander Tata celebrations around a 150 years of nation-building.
It was in August last year that Tata Motors had unveiled its new unified brand promise of Connecting Aspirations that would encompass both its commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles divisions.
Drafting in consultancy Futurebrands, Tata Motors took some time to arrive at this positioning, keeping in mind its vision for the present and the future.
“Though we hired a brand consultant, a lot of it was our own intuition really, ” says Vivek Srivatsa, Head, Marketing, Domestic Passenger Vehicles Business, Tata Motors.
A symbolic tagline, Connecting Aspirations represents the brand as an interconnected system of mobility solutions that are intelligent, perceptive, warm and expressive. This certainly shone through at the pavilion, which had buses designed to suit the differently-abled, had an environment focus, and so on.
The idea behind the new brand positioning, explains Srivatsa, was that even though Tata Motors had been selling commercial vehicles for over 60 years and passenger vehicles for nearly 20 years there was no core philosophy to connect the customers buying the brand.
“Also, we needed a unified message that was relevant to both categories,” he points out. Commercial vehicles (CV) are all about making money, earning a livelihood and ROI (return on investment). Passenger vehicles (PV), on the other hand, are driven by emotion. “On the CV side it is making business dreams come true. On the PV side, it was about fulfilling the design aspirations.”
Explains Srivatsa, “We constantly track RTB (reason to buy). We found that design had become the compelling feature to buy a passenger vehicle. Earlier cost and fuel efficiency were the top two reasons. But in the last two or three years the top RTB was design.”
Design-driven
The minute design becomes the top RTB, emotions come in, and the future also becomes important. “We find that the consumer, even as she is buying a vehicle is thinking about what to buy after five years. So we had to keep this in mind too,” he says.
The two new cars that were unveiled at the AutoExpo - the H5X concept, a luxury 5-seater SUV and 45X concept, a premium hatchback – are built on Tata’s new design language of Impact 2.0, says Srivatsa.
Once Tata Motors had established that design was grabbing the attention of Indian customers, even in mass segments, it launched its Impact Design language in 2016. Tiago, Tigor, Hexa and Nexon were built on Impact Design philosophy.
Now, the company has stepped up a gear with Impact 2.0. “The technology architecture of both these launches (H5X and 45X) is future-ready,” says Srivatsa. So the electronic engineering that goes into it allows voice-activated control. This means when you get in, you can tell the car “take me home” and the car will auto-switch the GPS navigation to home instantly.
Future pillars
Srivatsa says three pillars driving Tata Motors in developing passenger vehicles are design, safety and infotainment. So on offer will be handsome cars with high-quality infotainment in a connected environment with special focus on safety, such as insistent beepers if you don’t put on safety belts. Srivatsa says segments such as hatchbacks and sedans are getting sub-segmented. So precise marketing is necessary to get the right customers. Therefore, Connecting Aspirations will be the umbrella brand tag line. Each car will have its product-specific positioning for the targeted customer profile.
He points to how Hexa, which should logically be getting older consumers given its higher price point, is attracting younger customers who, one would imagine, would choose entry-level cars. “We are selling over 1,200 Hexa units a month,” he says.
Brand consultant Giraj Sharma says that as a thought Connecting Aspirations is apt as it is a show of intent. “From a brand purist point of view I will say, it is a nice, clean thought. As an internal motivator it will charge employees.” However, he is not so sure about how it will resonate with consumers and feels it will need some more messaging.
Santosh Desai, MD & CEO of Futurebrands India, says ‘Connecting Aspirations’ actually came up after extensive engagement with consumers of all categories and hearing their expectations. “The intent is already being translated into delivery in terms of product development,” he says. Consumers have to see Connecting Aspirations manifesting in the product experience. “We have started seeing product rollouts with a different mindset already,” he points out.
 
From the Nano to the H5X concept due to be launched a year later, Tata Motors has travelled a long way – and it’s not always been a smooth journey. Will the future offer a better ride? Certainly, there is clear direction now."

 Tata Motors today reported 38 per cent jump in domestic sales at 58,993 units in February, led by continued strong sales in commercial and passenger vehicle (PV) segments in the domestic market. The company had sold 42,679 units during the same month last year, Tata Motors said in a statement.
 Domestic sales of commercial vehicles in the month grew 36 per cent to 41,222 units compared to 30,407 units in the year-ago period, fuelled by robust infrastructural developments, fresh tenders in car carriers, coal movement and the petroleum sector. Passenger vehicle (PV) sales stood at 17,771 units as against 12,272 units in February 2017, up 45 per cent.
 The company said the jump in PV sales was due to increasing demand of Tiago and Tigor along with Nexon and Hexa gaining traction in the steadily growing UV segment.“The passenger car segment registered a strong growth of 17 per cent while the UV segment grew 165 per cent, clearly showing a trend of growing customer base across segments,” Tata Motors said.
 However, sales from exports in February 2018 declined 3 per cent to 4,768 units over last year. 
 With regard to spike in commercial vehicle sales, it said the growth was also bolstered by increasing demand from construction, growing logistics, e-commerce and FMCG applications."

Aggressive bids by Tata Motors for supply of electric buses for city transport saw the prices of the vehicles drop significantly.
The nine-metre-long electric buses quoted as low as ₹85 lakh and the 12-metre ones at ₹98 lakh, against the normal listed price of ₹1.6 crore and ₹2.1 crore, respectively.
The prices of the winning quotes of e-buses are close to that of luxury diesel-powered inter-State transport buses.
If the current prices are any indication, electric bus sourcing is in for a major shift, according to auto industry sources.
With these quotes, Tata Motors has become L1 bidder in six cities, and the Goldstone-BYD combine bagged three cities for supply of electric buses in nine of the 11 chosen for pilot multi-modal public transport project under FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) India.
The Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises had extended a subsidy of ₹437 crore to 11 cities under the FAME India for the launch of electric vehicles to encourage the States to invite tenders.
Gross cost contract
In the tenders floated by nine of the 11 cities with one million-plus population, Tata Motors has bagged six cities — Indore, Lucknow, Jaipur, Kolkata, Guwahati and Jammu — five of which are outright sale, and one on gross cost contract (GCC). Goldstone-BYD has bagged all the three — Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mumbai — under GCC.
In the tenders opened on February 28, these two companies outbid others, which included M&M, Ashok Leyland, Eicher Motors, sources close to the development told BusinessLine.
While Tata Motors will supply 190 electric buses, Goldstone, which partnered Chinese major BYD, will provide 290 buses.
It was proposed to offer 40 buses for each city under the pilot project. However, TSRTC in Hyderabad has decided to take 100 buses, Bengaluru is considering 150 buses, and Mumbai is sticking to 40.
While Ahmedabad is in the process of finalising, in the case of Delhi, where the courts have directed it to consider EVs, they are likely to come up with a much larger tender of procuring about 1,000 buses, another source requesting anonymity said.
In the case of outright purchase, the Centre provides 60 per cent subsidy and the rest is provided by the State road transport corporations. With most of the RTCs under financial stress, they are looking at GCC, where the buses would be operated and maintained by the supplier at a fixed cost per km.
The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has finalised Goldstone-BYD, where six others were in fray, for 40 buses, where the corporation will pay ₹37.5 per km. Just to compare this with other luxury bus service, it works out to about ₹50 a km. Likewise, TSRTC has also chosen Goldstone for supply of 40 buses in Hyderabad, also under GCC.
The buses are being offered in two configurations of nine and 12 meters, with the latter having the capacity to seat 42 passengers.
The BMTC had invited tenders for 150 e-buses and it expects to get ₹1 crore as subsidy per bus from the Centre.
A source pointed out that while at ₹85 lakh, the EVs’ cost compares with some of the luxury diesel buses, their durability has to be tested in tough Indian conditions.
“If these manage to achieve similar reliability and durability, in major metros like Delhi, where there is growing concern about vehicular pollution, the entire fleet may be upgraded to EVs. We believe they are robust and durable as they have far less moving parts,” the source pointed out.
These buses may be deployed in a phased manner over the next three to six months."

Tata Motors is confident of maintaining double-digit growth in its passenger vehicles sales in the coming quarters.
The company’s passenger vehicle sales have grown by 18 per cent at 167,208 units during the April 2017 and January 2018 period compared with industry growth of eight per cent. In February, Tata’s PV volumes posted a whopping 45 per cent (at 17,771 units).
S N Barman, Vice-President – Sales and Network, Passenger Vehicle Business Unit, Tata Motors told BusinessLine on the sidelines of the launch of Zest Premio (priced at ₹746,800, ex-showroom, Chennai), a special edition of its compact sedan Zest, “All our recent launches – Tiago, Tigor, Hexa and Nexon – are doing well. Sales of each model have been increasing gradually.”.
Its compact SUV Nexon is reported to be doing well as per the company’s plans. Its current sales rate is over 4,000 units a month and the company sees an opportunity to increase it to over 6,000 units in the near term and more later.
With Nexon, Tata’s UV sales have zoomed to 38,020 units in the 10-month period of this fiscal against 13,946 units in the year-ago period.
Also, hatchback Tiago’s monthly volumes have grown to 7,000-7,500 units now from 3,500-4,000 units at launch in 2016.
With the new Zest Premio, Tata Motors hopes to increase the monthly sales from the present 2,500-3,000 units. Zest is 4-star rated for safety by the Global NCAP, a UK-based safety and testing organisation.
Barman said the expansion of its dealer network and changes at the existing dealerships will also support the growth.
Presently, about 84 per cent of its sales is in the personal transportation segment, while the rest are sold in the fleet segment. The ratio was the reverse before the launch of new models."

Nita Co, the sole distributor of Tata Motors’ trucks in Bangladesh, and has an assembling unit for medium and heavy-duty vehicles.
According to Matlub, a mere 25 per cent localisation can help the JV to earn 20 per cent export subsidy on engineering products. This, coupled with zero duty imports to India, can make Bangladesh a cheaper destination for Tata Motors to source original equipment for Indian operations.
 “It would be more viable, both logistically and production-cost wise, if Tata Motors can leverage the Bangladesh facility to cater to the North East of India and also to Myanmar,” he told reporters on the sidelines of CII’s eastern regional meeting here in the city.

Jag’s 2018 F-Type is a serious sportscar and will shout you down with its exhaust note if you argue




Sit down and drive The cabin gets additions like special edition SVR seats that are adjustable in 14 different ways
   -  S Muralidhar


Unlike the trio of German luxury car brands who have each had their own performance divisions, which have, for decades, created cars like Mercedes-AMGs, BMW Ms and Audi’s RSs, Jaguar LandRover’s attempt at offering souped-up special editions and high performance versions of its road-going cars is only just over a couple of years old. The Special Vehicle Operations division’s first output was the Range Rover Sport SVR and then came the Jag F-Type SVR.
Getting into the business of special, high performance vehicles was the right next step in its evolution for JLR; and the company isn’t losing any more time in the game. The F-Type SVR was born out of the Project 7 and soon the Project 8 influenced XE SV would become the fastest production Jag ever. There is more to come later this year from the SVO division, including the F-Pace SVR unveiled at the New York Auto Show earlier this week. In fact, JLR is planning to set up dealership outlets that will focus specifically on just its SVs.
 








 
 
These are serious performance cars. But, somewhat similar to the claims made by Mercedes-AMG, Jaguar officials also mention that the intent with SVO vehicles is to offer the duality of track-level performance and everyday driving comfort. That is a claim that finds resonance with the F-Type SVR that I was piloting earlier this week on JLR’s proving grounds in Gaydon, UK. The F-Type SVR has been available for special orders from Indian customers from last year, but I was behind the wheel of the model year 2018 F-Type SVR — which promises even more performance and even better on-edge handling than the predecessor.
Design

The F-Type was a breakthrough sportscar for Jaguar; its design and performance really setting up the brand to take on serious competitors in the business. For the F-Type SVR, the folks at the SVO division picked out the base model’s original design and its already light, but rigid chassis with its extensive use of aluminium. Performance boost for sports cars is best achieved by a combination of weight reduction and powertrain improvements. The regular F-Type all-wheel drive was already a taut, well-balanced sports car, but its amazing how light-weighting was still possible and from some unexpected components.
The SVR’s exhaust system is now Titanium and Inconel, the seat frames are now made out of magnesium and the new set of 20-inch forged alloy wheels save about 13 kg compared to the alloys in the regular F-Type. The rear suspension knuckles have been redesigned and constructed to be lighter than the conventional knuckles and the carbon-ceramic matrix braking system (optional addition) offers another 20 kg of weight reduction over the conventional F-Type.
The F-Type’s design has largely been retained for the SVR; much of the changes are focused on improving the aerodynamics. With one of the performance targets being a top speed of 320kmph, the F-Type SVR gets extra bits like an active carbon fibre rear spoiler with a wider and more elevated wing, a flat front underbody and additional, larger front fender and hood vents as part of its aero package. The car continues to look stunning in profile with its classic two-seater sports car proportions — the long bonnet, the elegantly curved roofline, the strong rear haunches and the low, compact stance — is now complemented by the SVR’s improvements.
The F-Type is offered with multiple engines and trim levels.
Performance
Not to be confused with the regular F-Type and its four-cylinder engine or the 400 Sport and its V6, the SVR features the 5.0-litre V8 supercharged petrol engine found in the F-Type R, but tuned to deliver a higher 575 hp of peak power and 699.6 Nm of peak torque. In fact, the powertrain set-up is borrowed from the Project 7, with adjustments to the eight-speed gearbox and a whole new calibration for the car’s adaptive dynamics set-up. The all-wheel drive system is a carry over, but the algorithm for torque vectoring has been reworked to cut the possibility of understeer. A rework of the electric power steering’s set-up also means that the F-Type SVR’s wheel offers more feedback and a very likeable directness in response, best felt during high speed turn-ins.
At the Gaydon track, one of the first tests was on the high speed long track, which with its four lanes and long straights is strangely called the emissions circuit. The F-Type SVR’s visceral acceleration comes through with the needle racing to speeds of upto 280 kmph effortlessly. Its rated acceleration is 3.7 seconds for the 0-100 kmph run. On the track, I recorded 225kmph on the speedo with just about 2.6 km of the tarmac behind me. The F-Type was loud with its grunty exhaust note egging you on to keep engaging the engine. The SVR sounds louder, though the difference is probably marginal. For all those who have been woken up by an eager owner’s F-Type in the neighbourhood, the stat to keep in mind is that the exhaust note is a whisper short of the legal limit.
The F-Type SVR’s improved AWD settings and steering response come into play at the turns on the circuit, offering a huge jump in confidence levels. The four turns are mostly wide, sweeping ones, but it was the speeds at which the SVR could take them on that made the difference. With quick, measured corrections, the F-Type SVR could do much higher speeds than were recommended for the turns. The improvements to the suspension also make it surprisingly composed on bad roads, which was simulated in the next stretch of tarmac that I test drove the car on. With the setting expectedly focused on agile handling, the broken patches, rumbler strips and uneven tarmac on this track didn’t leave me with a sore backside; and for a change I was keen on putting those 265/35 Pirellis into the holes and not around them.
Bottomline
The F-Type SVR cabin gets some additions too, including the option of a carbon-fibre roof. There are some more trim elements in carbon-fibre within the cabin and then there are the new lozenge-quilted special edition SVR seats for the driver and passenger. These seats are now adjustable in 14 different ways too. Most other additions are subtler and focused on improving the materials on offer. The standard F-Type features for the cabin including the touchscreen infotainment system and the 10-speaker Meridian audio system are also standard in the SVR.
The fastest Jaguar just got better for its 2018 model year edition. It is certainly far more composed and predictable on the edge compared to the other F-Type models. But the F-Type SVR is certainly not for the average Joe looking for a luxury car. Prices will be ₹2.6 crore or thereabouts."
161,2018-04-01,Tata Motors,"Berger Paints a rosy picture
Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
What are the technical prospects for Berger Paints and Tata Motors
Sanjib Parida
Berger Paints India (₹256.4): The significant long-term support in the ₹235-240 held well for the stock of Berger Paints India. This support band consistently provided base for the stock in February and March. After taking support, the stock advanced 5.5 per cent last week. This rally has formed a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern in the weekly chart, implying a bullish trend reversal.
Moreover, the stock has decisively breached its 50 and 200-day moving averages last week and trades well above them. The daily relative strength index has entered the bullish zone from the neutral region while the weekly RSI continues to feature in the neutral region. Both the daily and weekly price rate of change indicators have entered the positive territory, implying emergence of buying interest.








 
 
The indicators and bullish engulfing pattern in the weekly chart clubbed together paint a rosy picture on the stock. The short to medium-term outlook is bullish for the stock. An emphatic breakthrough of the key barrier at ₹270 will improve the bullish momentum and take the stock higher to ₹290 and ₹300 in the medium term.
Further rally beyond ₹300 can push the stock to ₹320. Investors with a medium to long-term perspective can buy the stock in declines while maintaining a fixed stop-loss at ₹230. On the other hand, a conclusive tumble below the key support band between ₹235 and ₹240 can drag the stock down to 220 and 210 levels. Next significant support is in the range ₹195-200 range. Investors with a long-term horizon can stay invested with a stop-loss at ₹180.
Tata Motors (₹327.4): Since encountering a key long-term resistance at around ₹600 in September 2016, the stock of Tata Motors has been in an intermediate-term downtrend. Both the medium and short-term trend is also down. The stock trades way below its 50 and 200-day moving averages. Nevertheless, the stock is nearing a key long-term support in the ₹300-310, which can provide cushion for the stock's downtrend.








 
 
A subsequent upward reversal needs to be observed. Such an upward reversal can take the stock higher to ₹355 and ₹375 levels. To alter the short-term downtrend, the stock required to conclusively move beyond ₹375 levels. Key resistances above ₹375 are at ₹400 and ₹425 levels. Supports below ₹300 are pegged at ₹280 and ₹265.
What is the outlook for Castrol?

Castrol India (₹205.1): Last week, the stock of Castrol India advanced 3 per cent in the midst of choppiness, taking support at ₹195. In early this February, the stock took support at ₹175 and began to trend upwards. Since then, the stock has been in a short-term uptrend. In the medium term, the stock is in a sideways consolidation phase in the wide range between ₹175 and ₹212.








 
 
An upward break-out of this range can push the stock northwards to ₹225 and to ₹245 levels. Conversely, if the stock plunges below the immediate support level of ₹195 can find support at ₹185. But a slump below ₹185 will mar the short-term bullish outlook and pull the stock down to ₹175 in the coming months.

Less than three months after announcing a temporary cut in production at its Halewood plant, Jaguar Land Rover is to announce cuts to temporary roles in one of its British plants in the face of “continuing headwinds,” facing the car industry.
The Tata Motors-owned car maker said it remained committed to its UK plants, and would continue to recruit engineers, graduates and apprentices, but would be making adjustments to its production schedule and level of agency staff as part of regular reviews to ensure market demand was balanced globally.
While the company did not release a figure, the UK press, including Reuters, reported up to 1,000 jobs would be shed and production would be cut at its Solihuall and Castle Bromwich plants. 
Solihull is home to the Jaguar XE, the Range Rover, the Land Rover Discovery and the Range Rover Sport, and currently employs over 10,000 people. 
Castle Bromwich is home to a number of Jaguar vehicles, including the XE, the XF and the F-Type
The announcement will fuel debate on the impact of Brexit on the industry, after the company pointed to the uncertainty around leaving the EU, alongside the challenges facing diesel, when announcing the “temporary adjustments” to its production schedules at Halewood in January, home to the Range Rover Evoque and Land Rover Discovery Sport. 
This was despite the firm recording its best year to date in 2017, with 620,000 units sold.
 In Britain, there are fears over the future of the auto industry, which is heavily reliant on its EU supply chain, and customer base.
“This is desperately bad news for all those affected and a worrying sign of how the deep uncertainty around Brexit is continuing to damage Britain’s economic performance,” said Peter Kyle MP, a member of the pro-Remain, Open Britain campaign, condemning the government’s decision to rule out single market and customs union membership."

155,2018-04-25,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors initiates ‘Turnaround 2.0’ to gain passenger-vehicle market share


Guenter Butschek, CEO & MD, Tata Motors




Guenter Butschek, CEO & MD, Tata Motors


Tata Motors has already put in place a turnaround plan to gain market share in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment.
The company, buoyed by the turnaround of its commercial vehicles (CV) division in the last financial year, has now initiated a similar programme – called ‘Turnaround 2.0’ – for its PV segment.
According to Guenter Butschek, MD and CEO, parts of the turnaround plan (for the PV segment) were put in place last fiscal onwards. 
Under Turnaround 2.0, the company’s efforts will be to enable its PV business to be “self-funding and profitable”, build confidence and acceptability for its portfolio from old and new buyers, which in-turn will lead to a gain in market share.
“With Turnaround 2.0, we focussed on the domestic commercial vehicle segment and regained market share. We demonstrated that we could de-bottleneck the supply chain. Now, we are looking to implement the turnaround plan for passenger vehicle business,” he said on the sidelines of the inauguration of a new PV showroom here.
Tata Motors is the Number Four passenger vehicle-maker in the country with Maruti, Hyundai and Mahindra being the top three.
Rising input costs
Tata Motors has adopted a wait-and-watch policy on the movement of aluminium prices.
A report by ICRA says that post the US imposing sanctions on Rusal, one of the leading aluminium manufacturers globally, prices of the metal have sky-rocketed by 30 per cent over the last few weeks. The automobile industry, one of the key users of aluminium, is likely to be impacted by the sudden spurt in prices. (Aluminium along with its alloy accounts for about 10 per cent of the weight of a hatchback.) 
“Let’s wait and see how it develops,” Butschek said.
He, in fact, pointed out that the company has already initiated a price rise of ₹60,000 (across its portfolio) from April. This was done to offset rising input costs such as copper, steel and rubber.
Focus on EVs
Butschek also did not rule out the company’s focus on electric vehicles (EVs). Tata Motors has so far delivered some 200-odd fully electric Tigors, its compact sedan.
First-time buyers continue to be a huge opportunity that can be tapped in the EV segment.
Pointing out that EVs were the need of the hour, the MD and CEO said Tata Motors was open to experimenting with electrification of fleet of different commercial operators. Commercial fleet sales, at present, account for 10-12 per cent of the total vehicle sales of the company. 
“We have a plan and are in active discussion with such fleet operators,” he said."

Stepping up The fit and finish quality of interiors in Tata cars has improved. - S MURALIDHAR

There are big gaps in Tata Motors’ portfolio yet to be filled. A premium small hatch is one; a mid-size family sedan is another. The Nexon, though, managed to plug one gap in the compact sports utility vehicle (SUV) category. And it has been quite successful, clocking over 28,000 units since launch.
The Nexon’s design and some of its unique, true-to-segment exterior features set it apart from the others in a category that is mostly filled with SUV-style hatches. One feature that it lacked was an automated manual transmission (AMT). Buyers in the small hatch and entry sedan categories are increasingly looking at the convenience of an AMT gearbox. Driving mostly on crowded city roads, they are willing to spend that 6 to 8 per cent extra compared to the same trim manual, so that they may go clutch-free.
In fact, Tata Motors says that it has been encouraged by the demand for the AMT versions of the Tiago and the Tigor, which contribute 25 per cent and 12 per cent respectively to the total volumes of these two models. Naturally, integrating the AMT tranny to the Nexon powertrains was in the wings. We got a taste of the new transmission paired with both the petrol and diesel engines.
 








 
Design
The Nexon’s strength is its design, the crossover-like combination of tall stance, raised shoulder line and curved roofline ending in a pert rear gives it special appeal. Of course, it has the sub-four-metre advantage too, though, the inherent limitation of its compact proportions becomes all too clear when you step into the cabin. But, combined with a big leap in fit and finish quality that Tata cars have seen right from the Tiago, the Nexon is a pleasant surprise. The new HyprDrive SSG AMT (short for Self-Shift Gears) is no different — in fact Tata has taken it one step higher with a new online personalisation platform where customers can choose from a range of options including contrast body colours for the roof and many new accessories. The Nexon AMT is also being introduced with a new body colour called Etna Orange and a contrast dual-tone roof colour option called Sonic Silver. The shoulder line garnish, which was in a matte white finish in the manual Nexon is also being offered in the same sonic silver paint in the AMT and looks much better.

Cabin
The new Nexon AMT’s cabin sports all the features that the manual transmission version is being offered with, including the 6.5-inch floating dash-top infotainment touchscreen and the eight-speaker Harman Kardon music system. Dual front airbags and ABS with EBD are standard across trim variants. The Nexon’s cabin is not much larger than the average premium hatch in terms of legroom and shoulder room. However, there is ample headroom and there is also a very usable 350-litres of boot space. The AMT version is being offered in the comparable top-spec XZ MT variant, and is called the Nexon XZA+ with SSG.
Performance
For the Nexon SSG AMT, the powertrains remain the same three-cylinder, 1.2-litre Revotron petrol and the four-cylinder, 1.5-litre Revotorq diesel engines with their underlying six-speed manual gearboxes. The AMT system sits on top of these trannies.








 
 
Like in the Nexon manual transmission, the new SSG version also gets the three drive modes — Expo, City and Sport. With the mode selector dial you can, with one turn, go from City (default) to a peppier Sport mode. Tata Motors has also decided to give the AMT version a triptronic manual mode, where with the flick of the selector stick to the left, the driver can push it up or down to choose a gear. Smart call to also make the Sport mode as default for the triptronic since drivers will opt for manual gear selection mostly during overtakes and quick acceleration.
Both the engines generate 110 PS of peak power and 170 Nm and 260 Nm of peak torque respectively for the 1.2L Revotron and 1.5L Revotorq — identical to the manual transmission variants. Both engines are turbocharged and so, peak torque is available from sub-2,000 rpm levels. Driving is excellent, and the refinement levels of both the engines are good too, considering the other powertrains in this segment. Despite being a three-pot engine, the petrol doesn’t have the usual roughness that is associated with mills in this class.
The AMT gearbox is inherently less capable and less refined than a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or a torque converter automatic. It is as yet a technological compromise that enables a clutch-free experience for drivers while not making a heavy dent on their wallets. And with the prospect of delivering the same fuel efficiency as their manual transmission versions, AMTs manage to offer much more bang for the buck. But, that doesn’t mean refinement levels can’t be improved and Tata Motors has demonstrated that with the Nexon SSG AMT. Under light acceleration, the typical head-nodding shift shock can be felt mildly rocking you at the seat.
But, it is tolerably low and at higher speeds and even under heavy acceleration, shift shocks are reduced. Tata engineers have chosen to tie together multiple sensors and let responses flow through a transmission control unit. This has enabled features like the creep function where the car keeps moving forward at speeds under 8 kmph even without throttle input; also smart hill assist where the same engaged clutch keeps the car from rolling backwards when on an incline (even though it doesn’t have an electronic parking brake).
Kick downs are also just that bit faster, though overall response time between throttle input and gear change is still slower compared to CVTs and torque converter gearboxes.
Bottomline
Straight line stability in the Nexon AMT is good even at high three-digit speeds. Even though the suspension seems like it may feel a bit high sprung and bouncy, the overall ride quality is good with a sturdy feel and feedback. There is body roll though, and perceived build quality is good, though there is room for improvement. Some nice nifty features like the wearable Peps key, which customers can wear like a watch and use to open and lock the car really help boost the Nexon AMT’s appeal.
The infotainment system misses offering Apple CarPlay and the electric power steering should feel heavier at higher speeds to inspire more confidence. However, overall, the Nexon HyprDrive SSG is still an excellent AMT option for buyers looking for the convenience of an automatic. Expect a premium of about ₹40,000-₹50,000 over the manual transmission variant. The AMT model is being launched next week."
153,2018-04-27,Tata Motors,"Fitch affirms Tata Motors at BB+; outlook stable 
 International rating agency Fitch today affirmed the ratings on the country’s largest automaker by revenue, Tata Motors, at BB+ with a stable outlook.
The ratings, which includes a one-notch uplift from its standalone rating of ‘BB’ on its linkage with Tata Sons Limited (TSOL), reflects its leading position in the domestic commercial-vehicle market and the passenger-vehicle business, which is recovering after the success of new product launches in recent years, Fitch said a statement.
The rating also reflects the strong positioning of its 100 per cent-owned subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover, which has a rating of BB+/stable outlook, in the premium segment and a strong financial profile. JLR’s operating profit accounted for over 85 per cent of Tata Motors’ consolidated operating profit in fiscal year 2017.
“The stable outlook reflects our expectations of a gradual improvement in the profitability and strong financial flexibility, which will help meet significant investment requirements, especially in JLR, without any liquidity concerns and support the company’s leverage at a level commensurate with the current rating,” the agency said.
Improving domestic performance
Fitch has cited the improving domestic business as one of the major reasons for the rating as pointed to the leading position of the company in the domestic commercial-vehicle segment after product launches that addressed portfolio gaps.
The company’s volume grew by 9 per cent year on year in medium and heavy commercial vehicles and 23 per cent in light commercial vehicles in FY18. The overall market share rose to 47.5 per cent as of December 2017 from 44.4 per cent as of March 2017, according to the industry lobby, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, data.
“We expect CV demand to remain healthy in the next 12–18 months, supported by an improving economy and government plans to ramp up infrastructure outlays,” Fitch said.
On its car business, the report said, the company’s strategy to increase presence in different sub-segments has helped it regain some of its lost market share which rose to 6.2 per cent as of December 2017 from 5.2 per cent as of March 2017 as volume gained 21 per cent in FY18. Its volume in the growing SUV market surged more than 150 per cent in FY18 thanks to the Nexon and Hexa."

 Production at Tata Motors’ Pantnagar manufacturing facility was partially hit today after a section of workers resorted to an agitation following the death of one of their colleagues of cardiac arrest on Saturday. The plant in Uttrakhand produces the sub one-tonne mini-truck Tata Ace.
Confirming the partial loss of production, Tata Motors said the company is extending necessary support to the family in line with its policy and the management is looking into the issue to resolve it amicably. According to sources, a section of temporary and casual workers assembled at the plant when it opened today after the Sunday holiday, demanding monetary compensation and a job to one one of the members of the deceased worker’s family, leading to the disruption in production.
“It is a matter of personal loss to all of us... In line with the company policy, Tata Motors is extending necessary support to the family in this unfortunate situation,” Tata Motors’ spokesperson said in a statement. “In light of the above incident caused by natural death, some temporary workers are leading an agitation in the plant premises seeking unreasonable demands from the management. Owing to this, the production line operated by a set of these workers has been affected partially,” he added.
The rest of the workmen, especially the permanent employees, are continuing their normal work and extending support in resolving the issue, the company spokesperson said, adding, “the management is looking into this matter to resolve it amicably”."

Tata Motors came out with a disappointing performance in the quarter ended March 2018, with the consolidated net profit halving to ₹2175 crore in comparison with the March 2017 quarter. 
Although consolidated revenues (adjusted for GST impact) grew by 18 per cent to ₹91,279 crore, the company was not able to carry the forward this performance to the bottom line.
The sharp drop in profit is partly due to an exception expense to the extent of ₹1,640 crore. During the quarter, the company reviewed its assets /investments across and wrote off those that were no longer useful due to factors such as change of priorities, restructuring and so on. 
Besides, at the operating level, the company witnessed margin pressures due to elevated marketing expenses at JLR and also due to a decision to treat a higher proportion of its product development costs as revenue expense, beginning this quarter. 
Consolidated EBITDA margin, thus, came in at 12.8 per cent vis-à-vis 13.1 per cent in the same quarter last year. But for the exception expense, the domestic business put up a good show in the quarter. 
Tepid show by JLR 
Domestic sales volumes grew by 35-37 per cent, thanks to a revival in industrial growth and improving consumption. 
The standalone business recorded a profit before tax and exceptional item of ₹488 crore against a loss of ₹499 crore in the March 2017 quarter. 
But this was not the case with JLR. While sales volumes in China grew by 11 per cent, volumes in the US remained tepid due to market cyclicality. 
Uncertainty over exit and government policy for diesel vehicles saw the UK and Europe record a 12-21 per cent decline in volumes over the March 2017 quarter. 
Hence, JLR revenues grew only by a tepid 4 per cent. JLR’s profits dropped by about 50 per cent over the March 2017 quarter to £264 million now. 
With the domestic auto industry in an upturn and JLR too, strengthening its portfolio with recent/ planned launches such as the E-Pace, Velar, I-Pace and other refreshments of the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport, the coming months are expected to be better for the company."

In the quarter, Tata Motors took a one-time charge of ₹1,236 crore as it decided to shut down work on several models on which the work has started but the company felt they would not be profitable. This included the Tata Motors’ famed initiative of TaMo. 
Tata Motors standalone sales jumped 36 per cent to 204,255 units in the fourth quarter against 150,448 units in the same period last year. Domestic sales were up 39 per cent at 187,874 units from 135,416 units.
Brexit impact
Jaguar Land Rover, which contributes close to 90 per cent of Tata Motors’ revenue faced major headwinds in the UK with the impact of Brexit and increased taxes on diesel cars. Strong retail sales, particularly in China and North America, however, helped JLR somewhat offset the weakness in Europe.
Ralf Speth, CEO, Jaguar Land Rover, said: “Despite external headwinds, these results reflect the underlying strengths of Jaguar Land Rover. Sales have reached a new high, as strong demand in our key overseas markets offset the challenging conditions in the UK and other parts of Europe.” 
JLR’s revenue for the quarter ended March came in at £7,555 million, 4 per cent higher than in the same quarter last year. Its pre-tax profit, however, fell 46 per cent over the period to £364 million. JLR’s EBITDA margin fell to 12.2 per cent from 14.4 per cent a year ago. 
Guenter Butschek, Tata Motors CEO & MD, said the turnaround plan for Tata Motors is not done yet and the company will be entering into Turnaround 2.0.
 “As we step into Turnaround 2.0, we would like to embed Turnaround thinking within TML and our business plan will continue to remain robust in terms of sales, market share and financial performance. We want to structurally improve the business with reinforced and focussed actions in PV, and continuing the momentum in CV from last year. We will continue to enhance the organisation’s effectiveness, enabling greater speed, simplicity and agility in our efforts,” he said."
143,2018-05-23,Tata Motors,"End of the road for sentiment-driven Tata Indica
 It was the star of the 1998 Delhi Auto Expo with Murasoli Maran, the then Industry Minister, proclaiming it as the Kohinoor of India. 
Today, the Indica has bid adieu from the Indian market with its manufacturer, Tata Motors, finally deciding to slam the brakes on its production. The Indica’s numbers have been falling for many years now and there was really no point keeping it going.
Vision of Ratan Tata
Yet, this was the car that paved a new path for Tata Motors (which was then Telco) beyond the traditional route of making trucks. It was the vision of Ratan Tata, who had taken over as the Chairman of the Tata group in 1991, which made the Indica a reality. 
He was, and continues to be, passionate about cars, and saw no reason why India could not make its own automobile which would do it proud. The economy had just opened its gates to investments from international carmakers, and big names such as Peugeot, Daewoo, General Motors, Fiat and Hyundai had announced their plans.
Yet, Ratan Tata was confident that the product he envisaged would more than hold its own in a market where Maruti was the leader. His vision was to create a car that offered the “internal volume of an Ambassador and the size of a Maruti Zen” while pricing it closer to the Maruti 800.
There was tremendous excitement, with people wondering what the Tata product would look like. And when it was unveiled at the Auto Expo, the crowds went wild. There were other big launches from Hyundai, Daewoo and Toyota, but the Indica was the showstopper.
First hatchback
It looked stylish and had a lot of space to offer. It also had a diesel engine, which was a first for a hatchback in the country. 
There was no question that the competition was rattled, and it was hardly surprising that Maruti slashed prices of its 800 and Zen just prior to the Indica’s launch in end-December 1998.
The car had captured the imagination of the market and customers queued up for it. However, it was not too long thereafter that complaints began on its noisy engine and other quality issues. Sure, it was a great effort from a company which only made trucks, but sentiment was not going to help boost Indica sales.
With Maruti going into overdrive and Hyundai hitting the bull’s-eye with its Santro, the headwinds were just getting too strong for the Indica. 
It soon became a part of the taxi segment, but the numbers continued to fall. Eventually, it had to bow out, carrying with it a treasure trove of memories."

As part of the World Environment Day celebrations, the Maharashtra government on Thursday signed MoUs with Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors to promote electric vehicles in the State. 
In the two MoUs, the Maharashtra government said it will work closely with various fleet partners, taxi aggregators, logistics companies, amongst others, to deploy 1,000 electric cars over the next one year.
Under the aegis of the first MoU, M&M said it will make efforts to become fully electric-ready by further investing in its Chakan plant for manufacture of EVs, e-motor, controller, battery pack and other electric vehicle components for multiple mobility applications related to battery pack assembly of EVs. As part of this expansion plan, the company will invest an additional ₹500 crore.
Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, said: “Now, we are investing further in next generation EV technology solutions and are actively engaging with the ecosystem stakeholders, both private and public to drive faster adoption of electric vehicles. The government of Maharashtra recognises this fact, and we are delighted to make the State a key partner in our growth over the coming years.”
The first deployment of EVs, as part of the MoU with M&M, will see 25 Mahindra e2oPlus vehicles ported on the Zoomcar platform in Mumbai. 
The MoU between Tata Motors and the Maharashtra government was on similar lines but also included setting up of charging infrastructure in the State. “As part of our tender with EESL, we have already completed the production of 250 cars and initiated the execution of phase 2 orders. Today’s delivery of 5 Tigor EVs by EESL to the Maharashtra government has effectively paved way for connecting our aspirations in the e-mobility space with the government’s vision. 
“With Tigor EV, we have begun our journey in boosting e-mobility and will offer a full range of electric vehicles to the Indian customers. We continue to work in a collaborative manner to facilitate faster adoption of electric vehicles and to build a sustainable future for India,” said Guenter Butschek, CEO & MD, Tata Motors.
The announcements, however, will not result into any new projects for either of the companies as the deployment of these EVs will be a part of a contract signed by both Tata Motors and M&M with state-run Energy Efficiency Services (EESL). 
EESL will buy cars from the two automakers, who are currently the only ones in the country to sell electric cars, and then lease out these e-cars to several States including Maharashtra. 
Last year, EESL had floated a global tender for 10,000 e-vehicles where Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra had emerged as successful bidders. 
The first 500 cars have been supplied in the first phase of the tender, while the second phase has been put on hold till there is a clarity on the policy on charging stations as specification of charging stations will determine specification for the e-vehicle tender. 
More States to go electric
EESL has signed up an agreement with Maharashtra for lease out of e-vehicles and installing the EV charging stations at the government offices as the State is envisioning generating investment worth ₹25,000 crore in EV and component manufacturing, assembly enterprises and charging equipment manufacturing under its new Electrical Vehicle and Related Infrastructure Policy - 2018 announced on Thursday in Mumbai.
According to EESL Managing Director Saurabh Kumar, the company is in discussions with several States, including Andra Pradesh, Gujarat, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh for supplying electric vehicles (EV).
Andhra Pradesh has signed an agreement to procure 10,000 EVs. Maharashtra has committed 1,000 cars in the first phase and Gujarat has opted for 7,000 cars, he added. 
So far, EESL has supplied around 200 e-vehicles in Delhi NCR, more 150 cars to be added, while the first batch of 100 cars went to Andhra Pradesh."
141,2018-05-31,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors shares underperform four-wheeler peers 
Tata Motors’ shares have underperformed its four-wheeler peers namely Maruti Suzuki and M&M over the last decade. While Tata Motors’ market capitalisation has grown around four times, those of Maruti and M&M grew 12 and 7 times, respectively as on May 30, according to data provided by Capitaline.
The market capitalisation of Maruti Suzuki is now almost triple that of Tata Motors (in 2008, Tata Motors was ahead of Maruti Suzuki by ₹382 crore). The valuation gap between Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki has exploded because of superior financial performance by the latter, thanks to a boom in the domestic passenger vehicles market, Maruti’s continued market leadership and successful launches.
Compounded annual growth rate in sales and adjusted net profit of Maruti have seen it outperform Tata Motors on three-, five-, and 10-year basis (ending FY17) .
In FY18, Maruti’s topline growth of 17 per cent exceeded Tata Motors’ 9 per cent, but profit growth of 5 per cent was lesser than that of Tata Motors.
The gap between Tata Motors and M&M was 1.5 times in 2008 but the latter was able to bridge the gap and surpassed Tata Motors on April 25 this year.
In FY18, M&M’s performance was better than Tata Motors, with the former registering sales and adjusted net profit growth of 10 per cent and 59 per cent, compared to 9 per cent and 15 per cent by the latter.
Eicher comes closer
Not only four-wheelers, but the market capitalisation of two-wheeler major Eicher Motors (best-performing automobile stock) too, is now close to Tata Motors.
The gap in market capitalisation has reduced dramatically — from 25 times to 1.1 times in a decade.
This is because Eicher Motors has exhibited stupendous jump in profitability consistently in the last decade (ending FY17) — best among automobile companies — though topline growth has underperformed Tata Motors.
Based on average target prices estimated by analysts, the Tata Motors stock provides the highest upside potential of 37 per cent among the four stocks mentioned above, only because of its huge past underperformance and lowest FY20 price-to-earnings multiple of around 10 times.
Otherwise, the outlook on business is worrisome. “Undemanding valuation post steep correction makes the risk-reward favourable in our view. Near-term demand outlook for JLR remains challenging due to weakness in key markets of the UK, Europe and the US. For standalone business though, outlook is strong, helped by strong macro and likely improvement in market share trends,” said Jefferies on Tata Motors.
M&M, analysts’ favourite
Analysts unanimously vote for M&M due to reasonable valuation amid good fundamentals. Analysts expect 13 per cent rise in its stock price. There are mixed views on Eicher Motors, which is trading at 25-30 times FY20 estimated earnings. According to analysts’ target price, there is a potential for gains of 16-18 per cent in Maruti and Eicher. “We continue to like Maruti’s unique moats, though valuation (23x FY20E versuss five- and 10-year median at 17/20x) leaves little upside,” said HDFC Securities, which has a neutral rating. Elara Capital recommends to accumulate the Maruti Suzuki stock."

Tata Motors on Monday announced the establishment of an Electric Mobility Business as it looks to capture the growing demand in the segment, especially from the government. 
Shailesh Chandra will lead the Electric Mobility Business in addition to his current responsibility, the company said in a statement. 
The creation of this new business vertical will enable Tata Motors to deliver on its aspiration of providing innovative and competitive e-mobility solutions, Tata Motors said.
“Tata Motors is optimistic about the future of electric vehicles and will play a leading role in the electric mobility evolution in the country. We will also leverage on the capabilities of other Tata Group companies to develop the full ecosystem and fast-track the adoption of e-mobility,” said Guenter Butschek, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Tata Motors.
Shailesh has played an instrumental role in leading the project teams to deliver the EESL project and has been closely working with some of the Group companies and other ecosystem partners in his current role.

Last year, EESL had floated a global tender for 10,000 electric vehicles; Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra had emerged as successful bidders.
The first 500 cars have been supplied in the first phase of the tender, while the second phase has been put on hold till there is a clarity on the policy on charging stations as the specifications of charging stations will determine the specifications for the e-vehicle tender. 
The EESL tender is the largest single order for electric vehicles in the world.

Vidya RamJaguar Land Rover (JLR) is to move the entire production of its forthcoming Land Rover Discovery to Slovakia from the UK, in a major revamp of its manufacturing processes, British media reported on Monday. 
The shift to the recently opened Slovakian plant will result in several hundred job losses among agency workers, putting the company’s previously stated concerns about Brexit in the spotlight. While the company has said it will be investing further in Solihull, where the new Range Rover and Range Rover Sports will be built, the announcement was seized upon by critics of Brexit, who argued it pointed to the impact that concerns around Britain’s exit from the EU was already having on business and investment decisions. “The automotive industry has been warning of the dangers facing their sector and now it appears the reality of Brexit is settling in. Jobs have already gone in a number of car factories,” said campaign group Best for Britain. 
In April, JLR announced a temporary cut in production and job losses at its Solihull and Castle Bromwich plants, pointing to “continuing headwinds” facing the car industry. 
“The decision to move the Land Rover Discovery to Slovakia and the potential losses of some agency employed staff in the UK is a tough one but forms part of our long-term manufacturing strategy as we transform our business globally,” Jaguar Land Rover said in a statement quoted by Bloomberg on Monday. The investment into Solihull would also include enabling the production of electrical vehicles it said. 
In May, JLR announced a slight fall in pre-tax profits for the year ending in March (while pre tax profits for the quarter ending March fell sharply), pointing to “external headwinds.” The company and industry body SMMT have repeatedly pointed to the pressures from Brexit as well as Britain’s policy on diesel cars, including the introduction of levies on the sale of new diesel vehicles."

 Tata Motors’ heavy engineering and automation arm TAL expects a revenue of ₹ 1,000 crore from the robotics business over the next five years on the back of its entry into factory automation and launch of new products.
The company plans to foray into high-end automation technology from June 2019 which includes surface mount technology (SMT) assembly machines that are generally used for automatic manufacturing of electronic products like mobile phones, television sets etc. 
“We are expecting a revenue of ₹ 1,000 crore over next five years from robotics business. The growth will come from entry into factory automation across various verticals and commercialisation of different product portfolio that are in pipeline,” TAL Manufacturing Solutions CEO Amit Bhingurde said here.
 The company today unveiled new robot, Brabo TRO6-6, with 6 kg payloads having six-axis for various kind of movements. 
“We have already received order to supply 250 units of our robots in the third and the fourth quarter of last fiscal. We already shipped over 70 units and by September-October shipment of all 250 units will be completed,” Bhingurde said.
The robotics division currently contributes around ₹ 70 crore to TAL’s consolidated revenue. The company has two divisions- Pune based industrial business unit and Nagpur based aerospace business unit. The consolidated revenue of TAL was around ₹ 350 crore in last fiscal.
 Bhingurde said that the entire development and manufacturing of robots is being done at Pune unit of the company and 95 per cent of components used are sourced locally. 
“Next year we are looking at auto-guided vehicle, fast moving scara robots that have less axis but work very fast. By November-December we plan to expand 6 axis robotic arm to 12 and 15 kg payload and 20 kg by June 2019,” Bhingurde said.

US President Donald Trump had on Friday threatened to escalate a trade war with Europe by imposing a 20 per cent tariff on all US imports of European Union-assembled cars.
Trump posted his threat on Twitter the day European Union reprisals took effect against US tariffs on European steel and aluminium. The EU has targeted $3.2 billion in American goods exported to the 28-member bloc.
“If these tariffs and barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% tariff on all of their cars coming into the US Build them here!” Trump wrote.

Strong results Pareek is optimistic as the company has outperformed the market in terms of growth
   -  Yogendra


Friday is extra special for Mayank Pareek. 
At the gong of 9 am, the President of Tata Motors’ Passenger Vehicles Business Unit kicks off an exercise at the Pune plant with a whole bunch of charged participants. This is dead serious work where all of them are working on the Turnaround 2.0 plan for passenger cars.
Keeping Pareek company are over 1,000 employees who are part of the vehicle modular teams (VMTs). Each of these has a group leader or a Centre of Competence (CoC) Head who navigates them in the exercise of achieving cost targets. 
There are 24 VMTs with around 20-50 employees in each team focussed on hardcore engineering work. They are entrusted with the task of coming up with solutions like fewer/lighter components, cost-effective alternatives for parts in the car and so on. 
One of the more recent exercises saw a young engineer come up with a solution to reduce the number of parts in an exhaust system. He has barely been with the company two years and this made it doubly impressive. “I hugged him,” recalls a visibly elated Pareek who makes it a point to reward such achievers.
Focus on cost cutting
Needless to say, all participants are kicked about winning and the atmosphere at Pune is intense during the Friday drill. Everyone is also aware that this is a serious exercise, intended to cut costs and readying Tata Motors for the next phase of growth in passenger cars.
What is also reassuring is the visible change from initial scepticism to a large pool of “100 per cent believers”. Pareek narrates the instance when one particular team was behind targets and the COC promised him that this would be the last time it ever happened. 
“He has kept his promise and they are now ahead of target. They are supercharged now and I compliment him each time,” he says. Clearly, the effort is paying off big time with this year’s cost cutting estimated to be at least five times more than “whatever we have done anytime in the past”.
Pareek is delighted with the effort and says it is clear that everyone is putting his/her heart and soul into the effort simply because they want it to work. They are proud of their company and keen that it grows from strength to strength.
As he adds, it is extremely important to get the cost structure right and this is where Tata Motors is pulling out all the stops this year. And as much as products and marketing are critical at the front end, what “happens behind the curtain is as important if not more”.
From the company’s point of view, all this boils down to sustainability where “you are lean and thin to be able to win forever” and are not dependent on the vagaries of the market. More importantly, a competitive cost structure means that there is no need to go in for discounts and destroy a brand.
The exercise is all the more relevant considering that Tata Motors is now moving towards just two platforms (Alpha and Omega), which can roll out a slew of vehicles right from sedans and hatchbacks to MPVs and SUVs.
Today, there are seven platforms and costs typically go through the roof without any economies of scale. To that extent, this marathon exercise now underway will be in sync with the architecture strategy. “Turnaround 2.0 will make us fitter and we will go for the kill,” says an upbeat Pareek. Something similar has been created for marketing too, with product module teams and is working well.
All this fits in well with the slogan ‘Win Sustainably’, which is about consistency and just not excelling in a particular month, quarter or year. This is where an effective cost structure becomes critical at the back end while fixing the front end is no less important. 
Ahead of the curve
“Today, there are results to show as we have outperformed the markets for the last 27 months,” says Pareek. 
He then drives home the point showing how Tata Motors grew by 21 per cent in FY ’17 outpacing the market, which showed nine per cent growth. 
Likewise, in FY ’18, it was 22 per cent versus seven per cent while the first two months of the current fiscal have seen the market grow by 13 per cent to Tata Motors’ 43 per cent.
“We are the fourth largest player now and growing,” says Pareek while clearly indicating that the argument of a low base does not hold water any longer. Till about two years back, the extent of market coverage was around 50 per cent, which has since increased to over 70 per cent with products like Nexon, Hexa, Tiago and Tigor. 
“In two years and two months, we have launched four new brand names, which have increased the market span with real hot segments,” he says.
During this time, the network has also grown from 400 to 746 outlets and slated to touch 850 by this year-end. This will further increase to 1,000-plus by the end of 2019. 
Friendly dealers
Pareek explains that it is important for sales executives to reach out to customers and build the concept of the friendly neighbourhood dealer. 
The other important aspect is to “have your feet on the street” in terms of actually selling cars and talking to customers.
This is where training becomes important and it was not the easiest of tasks considering that dealers were only selling to fleet customers till not so long ago. 
Individual customers are a different ballgame, continues Pareek, since they have nearly three cars in their mind already, which means “your offering is one-third” in terms of probability. 
It is here that smart selling becomes important where executives convince customers through softer skills. 
For a fleet customer, the deal is closed in a day or two but this could go up to 60 days for individual buyers. Clearly, all the training is paying off though the best is yet to come."
130,2018-07-05,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors shares hit 5-year low on Nano, JLR woes
Our Bureau The share price of Tata Motors fell to a five-year low on the BSE after its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) warned that it could take a hit due to Brexit. 
Reports of Tata continuing with Nano production despite poor sales also dampened sentiments among investors. The scrip fell 3 per cent on Thursday to close at ₹261 on the BSE. 
“If Tata Motors had announced the closure of the Nano plant it could have temporarily lifted investor sentiment,” said the head of an institutional desk here. “There seems to be no other positive news from the company. This is why the shares are likely to remain under pressure.” 
Nano presence
There is a belief that Nano, the brainchild of Ratan Tata, could be staring at its end. 
A company release to the stock exchanges showed that only one unit of Nano was produced last month, against 275 in June 2017. Against 25 units in June 2017, none was exported last month, and domestic sales stood at three units. Yet the company has taken no decision on continuing with the model. 
Meanwhile, Ralf Speth, CEO of JLR, told a financial daily in the US that a “bad Brexit deal” would cost the company over £1.2 billion in profit each year. 
“As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around £50 billion in the UK in the past five years — with plans for a further £80 billion more in the next five. This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong (Brexit) outcome,” he was quoted as saying.
Later, PB Balaji, CFO, Tata Motors Group, clarified in a statement that JLR and Tata Motors have always maintained that the uncertainties from Brexit are avoidable and the business seeks clarity to ensure that the industry takes timely and right decisions to manage the transition. 
The Tata Motor stock is down nearly 40 per cent in 2018 so far despite the fact the domestic brokerages are bullish on the counter. Motilal Oswal, Edelweiss and Prabhudas Lilladher had asigned’ a ‘buy' rating on Tata Motors. Reportedly, at least 27 out of 40 brokerages covering the stock rate it a ‘buy’ or higher, 11 ‘hold’ and one each ‘hold’ and ‘sell’, according to Reuters."

It is no secret that the Tata Nano has been in free-fall mode for a while now. Yet, the fact that just a solitary car was produced in June is a sad reflection of a dream that went sour.
After all, this was a project that was very dear to Ratan Tata and truly caught the imagination of the world. The ₹1-lakh price tag was enough for some top guns like Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault-Nissan, to sit up and take notice even while there were naysayers who sneered at the effort. 
There is no question that the Nano was a huge global advertisement on frugal engineering, which also showcased the prowess of India. No wonder that Ghosn also decided to throw his hat into the ring with the ultra low cost (ULC) car in a partnership with Bajaj Auto.
From Tata Motors’ point of view, the Nano was the perfect plank for the two-wheeler rider keen on graduating to the next level. Its biggest draw was its price, which ironically ended up being the millstone around its neck. Nobody wanted to be associated with a cheap car but all that came much later.
Audacious costing
The significant part of the Nano was that it was for the first time that anyone had attempted such an audacious project in terms of costing. It also seemed pragmatic given that India was the largest producer of two-wheelers in the world, which also reflected the levels of affluence. 
There was no question that many of these customers would have been delighted to own a car so long as they could afford it. Hence, Ratan Tata was absolutely right in spotting an opportunity and deciding to work on it with a passion.
It was a throwback to the Indica days when the same man had thrown down the gauntlet in daring to produce a car when his company was better known for trucks. Even while the Indica could not quite build upon its initial momentum and kind of lost its way in later years, it was still a strong statement. 
The Nano had taken the challenge to an altogether different level thanks largely to its pricing. The world wondered how such a product could actually be conceived at ₹1 lakh. Till then, it was the Maruti 800, which was deemed the most affordable car for years and here was a rival model threatening to rewrite the rules of manufacturing.
Beyond this, it was going to be produced in West Bengal, a state that had little going in terms of industrialisation even while it had been home to Hindustan Motors’ Ambassador for decades. Having the Nano as the new resident was perceived as being prestigious since it had already got the attention of the world.
During an interview with this writer, Ratan Tata had spoken of the ₹1-lakh car. Its launch was still over a couple of years away even while it continued to make headlines. 
Tata’s dream
Tata spoke of the rationale behind the project and why positioning was important.
“If we are looking at a small car, we should not do this at the same proportion as cars of today are being looked at. We should be bold and take some risks so that we can have a much larger scale of consumption of that product in India or elsewhere,” he explained.
It was during the course of this interview that Tata articulated his aspiration for those masses of people in India who would benefit from this offering. He reiterated that it was important to set goals high.
“So you have to be very bold and say that I am going to really change the paradigm of how people are going to travel, how families are going to have transport. I am going to try to get families to stop using tractors to go into town or to sit on a motoscooter in a dangerous manner,” elaborated Tata. 
He was candid enough to acknowledge that it was not going to be the easiest of tasks to meet the ₹1-lakh price tag. It was perfectly natural for people to scoff at this unrealistic target but then, as he pointed out, the Indica had also experienced similar feedback from sceptics. 
“It can be done but need not be done in the conventional manner of how the West looks at such products. All I am trying to say is that the way the West perceives something and the way we must look at something is different. The West is not trying to address the low end of the pyramid,” said Tata.
It was during the 2008 Auto Expo in Delhi that the Nano was finally unveiled and the huge crowds gathered there broke into spontaneous applause. There were journalists from other countries too and it looked as if everyone wanted this little wonder on wheels to succeed.
The plant that didn’t grow
Yet, it wasn’t as if everything was hunky dory behind the scenes. The West Bengal plant in Singur was in the eye of a political storm with huge protests on the site. Even as the Nano was grabbing eyeballs at the Expo, ground reality in Singur was completely different. Would the people’s car be able to weather the storm?
It could not beyond a point and finally Tata announced a year later that the project would now move out of West Bengal. The Nano had found a new home in Gujarat, which literally lay down the red carpet for Tata Motors. It was the beginning of an auto wave in Gujarat where the Nano would pave the way for Maruti Suzuki, Ford and Peugeot.
After the exit from Bengal, it was clear that a lot of momentum had been lost. Reports of the car catching fire on roads did little to enhance its standing. However, the most awkward association become the ‘cheap’ reference, which deterred buyers.
It was only some weeks ago when the Indica bid adieu 20 years after it debuted at the 1998 Auto Expo. It’s quite likely that the Nano will follow suit someday. Yet, it will be still be an important part of India’s automobile history."
131,2018-07-05,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors produces just one Nano in June
 Tata Motors’ small car Nano is inching closer towards the end of its journey with just one unit produced in June, although the company maintained that no decision has been taken yet on stopping its production.
The entry level car, brainchild of Ratan Tata who envisaged giving a safer and affordable alternative to families riding on two-wheelers, sold just three units last month in the domestic market. 
In a regulatory filing, Tata Motors said there was no export of Nano in June. It had shipped 25 units in the same month last year. In terms of production, only one unit was produced last month as against 275 units in June 2017.
Domestic sales were at three units in June as against 167 units in the year-ago month.
When contacted for comments on whether the company has taken a decision to stop Nano production, a Tata Motors spokesperson said, “We are well aware that the Nano in its present form cannot continue beyond 2019 and may need fresh investments to survive. No decision has been made yet in this regard.” 
The spokesperson further said, “Meanwhile, we continue to produce Nano catering to customer demand in key markets.” 
The wrong turns
The Nano, which was unveiled in January 2008 at the Auto Expo with much expectations of being the people’s car, could not live up to the billing. The car was launched in the market in March 2009 with an initial price of close to Rs 1 lakh for the basic model despite cost escalations, with Ratan Tata insisting that “a promise is a promise”. 
However, from the beginning, Nano courted trouble. It was originally planned to be rolled out from Tata Motors’ proposed plant at Singur in West Bengal, where it faced intense political and farmer protests against land acquisition. The company had to shift its production to a new plant at Sanand in Gujarat. Instances of the car catching fire initially after it was launched didn’t help its cause either. 
Ratan Tata had admitted that the company made the mistake of promoting the Nano as ‘the cheapest car’. 
Legacy hotspot
It become a loss-making model for Tata Motors with ex-Tata Sons chairman Mistry, who was abruptly removed from the post, even going on to claim that the Nano “consistently lost value, peaking at Rs 1,000 crore”. 
Mistry also termed the Nano as one of the “legacy hotspots” and there was “no line of sight to profitability for the Nano, any turnaround strategy”. He had also claimed that Tata Motors did not stop producing the car due to “emotional reasons”."

Britain's biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover said a so-called “hard Brexit” would cost it 1.2 billion pounds ($1.59 billion) a year, curtailing its future operations in the United Kingdom. 
“We urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard our suppliers, customers and 40,000 British-based employees,” JLR's Chief Executive Ralf Speth said in a statement on Wednesday.
JLR joins a growing list of companies which have raised concerns about potential disruption to business if Britain crashes out of the bloc next March without a trading agreement with the European Union, a so-called hard Brexit. “The recent statement from JLR only reaffirms this position that a Brexit which increases bureaucracy, reduces productivity and competitiveness of the UK Industry is in no-one's interest,” JLR's Indian parent firm Tata Motors Ltd said in a statement on Thursday.
Shares in Tata plunged to their lowest in more than five years on Thursday, as investors turned jittery on the company, whose biggest business is JLR, which contributed nearly 77 per cent of its total revenue in the year ended March 31, 2018. “Prima facie, 1.2 billion pounds looks on the higher side and hence the reaction to the stock today,” said Basudeb Banerjee, an analyst with Ambit Capital.
Speth's comments come ahead of a meeting on Friday between Prime Minister Theresa May and her cabinet ministers to decide on strategy for Britain to negotiate its way out of the European Union, ending a 40-year trading relationship.
Because of uncertainty about what Britain actually wants from the EU after it leaves, the outcome of the cabinet meeting is seen as critical to progress in talks with the EU on the issue. Recent weeks have seen criticism of the government by some of the biggest companies operating in Britain.
Airbus and Siemens last week went public with their fears about what leaving the EU customs union and single market would mean for their businesses.
JLR said it needed “free and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market. “A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than 1.2 billion pounds in profit each year. As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile; we have spent around 50 billion pounds in the UK in the past five years - with plans for a further 80 billion pounds more in the next five,” Speth said in a statement. “This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.”

Tata’s premium hatchback Tiago was the first component of the turnaround effort for Tata Motors’ car business (file photo) PAUL NORONHA


Till about four years ago, the Net Promoter Score, or NPS, for a Tata car was minus (-)13. Today, it is +14 which effectively means that there are more people promoting the brand than its detractors, quite unlike the case earlier.
NPS is the difference between the percentage of promoters and detractors. For instance, in a brand survey targeting 100 respondents, if 60 promote the brand and 40 are its detractors, the NPS is +20. 
On the other hand, if there are only 30 promoters to 70 detractors, it would be -40. 
It in this context that Mayank Pareek, President (Passenger Vehicles Business Unit), Tata Motors, has reasons to be pleased with the change in perception. 
“Four years ago, more people were talking negatively about us, but this has changed with the NPS now at +14,” he says. 
This means that there are fewer detractors with more people reacting positively to Tata cars. 
In fact, the NPS was -4 at the point of launching the Tiago in April 2016. 
This premium hatchback was the first component of the turnaround effort for Tata Motors’ car business whose portfolio has grown since to include the Tigor, Hexa and Nexon. 
“We were very sure that the new products would bring in the new customers starting with Tiago,” says Pareek. The beginning, however, was predictably tentative since here was a company in the process of rebuilding customer trust.
Design, marketing strategy
The Tiago was an all-new offering even while there were naysayers who wondered how it could survive in a crowded segment. 
“We were, however, confident that its cool design would help it stand out along with smart marketing,” recalls Pareek. 
The numbers were slow in coming but have now settled comfortably at 8,000 units each month. The marketing strategy was to “let the quality and design sink into customers” for them to absorb it fully. “Brand building needs patience. It would have been a cakewalk to enhance volumes quickly through discounting but that would have killed the brand,” reasons Pareek.
The momentum is now in place with the Hexa and Nexon, while Tigor numbers are picking up slowly. The overall market coverage has also increased from 50-odd per cent at the time of the Tiago to about 70 per cent now thanks to finally being present in “real hot segments” like SUVs.
While this change in fortunes is welcome, Pareek says it is only one part of the story. “Our increasing coverage is essential but not sufficient. You should have a network to support products.” Two years ago, Tata Motors had 400 outlets which have now grown to 746 and will be up to 850 by the end of this year. 
Sales executives
Sales manpower has also doubled from 4,300 to 8,500 people. Where fleet customers once accounted for a lion’s share of the buyer base, this is no longer the case with individual customers being top priority. 
As Pareek says sales executives need a different set of skills to deal with individual buyers since they have other options to choose from in the market. “Each of these customers has 2.6 cars in his mind which means your product has to compete hard to get his/her attention,” he adds. 
For a fleet customer, the deal is closed in a day or two but this could go up to 60 days for individual buyers, says Pareek. A customer could ask for a test drive on a Sunday and the sales personnel need to be prompt in complying with this requirement. The hard work is paying off with more customers now queuing up for Tata cars."

Brexit is costing Tata Motors dear, with the company Chairman warning of uncertain times in some of the company’s major markets. 
“The global automobile industry is undergoing a structural shift due to technology-led business and market disruption, evolving consumer preferences, market cyclicality, regulatory overhauls and geopolitical uncertainty,” said N Chandrasekaran, Non-Executive Chairman at Tata Motors, in a letter to shareholders in the company’s annual report. 
The ACES (Autonomous, Connected, Electric, Shared) phenomenon is likely to transform mobility and influence consumer preferences going forward, he pointed out. 
 He added that some of the key operating markets for the group are faced with “diverse market dynamics requiring specific interventions to ensure sustainable profitable growth”. 
“North America is nearing the peak of the demand cycle and growth is likely to remain muted in the near term. While regulatory restrictions on diesel, market cyclicality, Brexit and taxation in UK pose specific challenges in Europe and the UK, the key Asian markets of China and India offer high growth opportunities led by GDP growth, strong domestic consumption and favourable demographic support,” he said. 
While the domestic market has been performing well for Tata Motors, JLR, that contributes to a lion’s share of the company’s overall revenues, has been under tremendous cost pressures due to increased taxes in the UK. 
In the March quarter, while JLR reported 4 per cent rise in net revenue at £7,555 million, its PBT fell 46 per cent to £364 million. 
“Jaguar Land Rover continues its investment for growth, launched exciting new products and landmark partnerships during the year. The company also announced its electrification roadmap to address diesel challenges. The company will focus on optimisation, drive operating leverage and manage capital spends prudently to offset the impact of headwinds facing the business,” Chandra said. 
Recently, Ralf Speth, CEO of JLR, told a financial daily in the US that a “bad Brexit deal” would cost the company over £1.2 billion in profit each year.
In his note in the annual report, Seth said, “While we respect the democratic decision of the UK people, JLR is seeking clarification and certainty on the terms of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. It is of paramount importance that as many benefits as possible are preserved. Demand has been undermined in Europe by consumer uncertainty over diesel, particularly in the UK where diesel cars face unfair tax treatment.”
The challenges at JLR have also led to a downgrade for Tata Motors by global ratings agency Moody’s. 
“The downgrade to Ba2 reflects our expectation of continued weakness in TML's consolidated credit metrics over the next two years, led by its wholly-owned subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc (JLR, Ba2 stable),” said Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody's Vice-President and Senior Credit Officer."

 Tata Motors today said it will hike prices of its passenger vehicles across models by up to 2.2 per cent from August to offset increased input costs. 
The company, which had increased prices in April by 3 per cent, however, said it expected sales momentum to continue despite the hike.
“We have been working on cost cutting, but the problem of input cost pressure is piling up and we will be taking a price increase on our passenger vehicles by August,” Tata Motors President Passenger Vehicles Business Unit Mayank Pareek told PTI.
 He further said the company had taken a price hike in April but the input costs continue to rise, mostly on account of increased commodity prices. When asked by how much the company will increase the prices, he said, “Roughly it will be 2 per cent to 2.2 per cent.” This will be over and above the 3 per cent increase in April, Pareek added. 
“The price hike will be across all models, although quantum will depend upon specific models,” he added. 
Tata Motors currently sells a range of vehicles starting from entry level small car Nano to premium SUV Hexa with price ranging from Rs 2.36 lakh to Rs 17.89 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). 
When asked if the proposed price hike will impact sales, he replied in the negative, “What we achieved in quarter one was despite the price hike we undertook in April. So we are confident of maintaining the sales momentum.” 
Pareek further said, “In the last 28 months we have been outperforming the market. In this year’s quarter one, while the industry grew 13.1 per cent, we have grown by 52 per cent.”"

Thanks largely to its four recently launched new-generation cars — Tiago, Tigor, Hexa and Nexon — Tata Motors has vroomed past the first quarter with a 52 per cent growth against the industry growth of 13.1 per cent.
The growth in the corresponding period last year was 22 per cent, against an industry rate of 7.11 per cent, said Mayank Pareek, President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors Ltd.
He attributed the performance to multiple factors such as meeting the aspirations of new customers and aggressive marketing focussed on drive-in experiences.
“We are No 1 in customer satisfaction in the South Zone and No 2 at the all-India level. We were in the 7th position four years back,” said Pareek, quoting US-based rating agency JD Power Associates.
Pareek was speaking to BusinessLine on the sidelines of the national launch of Nexon XMA, the compact SUV’s latest version in the mid-variant segment.
Asked why Kerala has been chosen as the launch pad for the new vehicle, he said: “We are the fastest growing brand in the State and netted a 36 per cent growth in Q1 of FY19, against the industry growth rate of 22 per cent.” Kerala is an important focus market for Tata Motors, as it contributed to 19 per cent of its passenger vehicles sales in the southern zone, he added. The southern region contributes 28 per cent of the company’s passenger vehicles sales.
The introduction of four new generation cars led the passenger vehicle business to grow 31 per cent in FY18, and by 63 per cent in June this year, he said.
He also ruled out plans to phase out Tata Nano, saying the model is doing well in certain pockets such as Kerala and hilly regions."
119,2018-07-27,Tata Motors,"S&P downgrades Tata Motors' long-term credit rating to ‘BB’
 S&P Global Ratings today lowered Tata Motors’ long-term credit rating to ‘BB’ from ‘BB+’ citing weakening volumes and other operational issues plaguing its cash-cow JLR, but retained its outlook at ‘stable’.
The agency also lowered its long-term issuer rating on the dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes to ‘BB’ from ’BB+’ of the country’s largest auto company by revenue.
“We downgrade Tata Motors to BB from BB+ to reflect our view of the weakening operating conditions for its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) over the next two-three years. A recovery in its domestic commercial and passenger vehicle businesses will only partially offset the weakness, in our view,” S&P said in a note.
‘High exposure’ 
The ratings agency expects JLR volume to grow at 6-8 per cent over the next two-three years, after a growth of just 1.7 per cent in FY18, against the expectation of 14-17 per cent rise during the year. “We believe the resilience of JLR has come down due to shifting consumer preferences, increasingly complex operating conditions, and its higher exposure to event risks such as Brexit and emerging trade wars,” it said.
 The underperforming British auto market, Europe’s aversion to diesel cars, and JLR’s high capes for electric vehicles (EVs) are likely trim its bottomline and larger negative free operating cash flows over the next two-three years, S&P added.
 On the stable outlook, the report said, it “reflects the expectation that its faster growth over the industry with steady but lower profitability will push up cash flow-to-debt ratio to 30-40 per cent over the next 12-18 months.”
The report said JLR volume is declining in part due to Europe’s aversion to diesel cars after the Volkswagen “dieselgate” emissions scandal. Diesel cars accounted for over 30 per cent of JLR’s volume in fiscal 2018, although the share of diesel cars in the its British and the European Union sales is over 80 per cent. Diesel car sale is gradually recovering in these markets, but the agency believes such vehicles are well past their peak.
 Tata Motors expects the share of hybrid and electric vehicles in its total sales volumes to rise to 20 per cent by fiscal 2023, from about 5 per cent now, tempering the impact of the decline in diesel volume, the agency said. “We believe the lingering risks of Brexit-related trade restrictions and of US import tariffs add further uncertainty to JLR’s operating performance,” it added.
 JLR’s lower operating scale, higher concentration in Britain and lack of manufacturing in the US, makes its financial performance less resilient than larger peers like Daimler, BMW, Fiat Chrysler, according to S&P.
 Britain accounts for about 70 per cent JLR’s manufacturing which is declining now, and the US accounts for 21.7 per cent of its volume. But China’s latest move to reduce tariffs on imported cars by about 10 per cent may offset some of this headwinds, according to the report.
“We expect JLR’s modest sales growth, stagnant price realisation per car, rising commodity prices, and higher product development expenses to continue to weigh on Tata Motors’ profitability,” the report said, adding operating margin was 5.7 per cent in FY18, 130 bps lower than estimate and also in FY17. But its peers have margins of 9-12 per cent.
 The ratings agency also expects JLR’s profitability to gradually recover to about 7 per cent in fiscal 2019 and 9 per cent by fiscal 2020. “Modest volume growth from its low-cost Slovakian operations, and better cost controls should support the recovery over the next two to three years,” it said.

The report is positive on the improvement in the home market, as it sees commercial vehicle (CV) volume growing strong over the next two-three years, clipping at 9-13 per cent in this period. The CV volume rose 16.7 per cent in fiscal 2018, boosting its market share to 45.1 per cent from 44.4 in fiscal 2017.
 However, the report said a fasting growing GDP, good CV and PV (passenger vehicle) portfolio, cost management, customer-centric approaches, and supplier rationalisation will boost the automaker’s sales and profitability over the next two to three years.
 But again heightened price competition from Ashok Leyland, Mahindra and Bharat Benz, and the recently announced changes to the CV tonnage policy could constrain its profitability, it warned."

Tata Motors posted its worst quarterly loss in nine years at ₹1,863 crore in the quarter ended June 30 as Jaguar Land Rover continues to face headwinds. The company had reported a profit of ₹3,199.93 crore in the same quarter last year.
Revenues were up 12.25 per cent at ₹65,956.78 crore (₹58,766.07 crore). 
Jaguar Land Rover, which contributes nearly 90 per cent to Tata Motors’ revenues, reported a loss of £210 million in June quarter as the unit’s revenues fell 6.7 per cent to £5.2 billion due to lower sales and increased incentives in China in advance of the July 1 duty reduction. 
“With regard to JLR, we faced multiple challenges including issues like China duty impact as well as the market issues like diesel concerns in UK and Europe,"" said Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran. 
Ralf Speth, Chief Executive, said the issues with JLR go beyond China duty impact. 
“We also continue to be impacted negatively by uncertainty over diesels in Europe along with Brexit and additional diesel taxes in the UK. Given these issues, we will remain focussed on driving growth and simultaneously reducing costs and boosting operational efficiency and capability, taking the necessary steps to shape our future,” Seth said. 
He, however, said that the company expects sales and financial results to improve over the remainder of the financial year, driven by continued ramp-up of new models, most recently the electric Jaguar I-PACE, and with the new lower duties effective in China. 
On a standalone basis, Tata Motors revenue jumped 83 per cent year-on-year to ₹16,830 crore. Profit after tax stood at ₹1,188 crore. Tata Motors said that its net debt soared to ₹ 62,436 crore as of June 30 from ₹39,977 crore as of March 31 due to negative free cash flow at both Tata Motors and JLR, and continued investments. 
Tata Motors CEO Guenter Butschek also warned of challenges in the company’s commercial vehicles business. “As I look ahead, there could be a few challenges in the short term particularly in Commercial Vehicles as the new regulations on axle loads come into effect but remain positive on the long term potential of the Indian market and I am confident that Tata Motors is taking the right steps to drive Competitive, Consistent, Cash Accretive Growth.”

Tata Motors came up with a disappointing performance in the quarter ended June 2018, recording a loss of ₹1,863 crore against a profit of ₹3,200 crore in the June 2017 quarter. 
The tepid show came on the back of the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) business seeing a loss before tax of £264 million (₹2,376 crore approximately). 
Lower wholesale volumes due to planned inventory reduction, postponement of purchase by buyers in China to take advantage of a tax reduction being implemented in July, depreciation of the pound against the dollar as well as higher depreciation and amortisation expenses worked against JLR during the quarter.
Outlook
Even as JLR wholesale volumes dropped 7 per cent during the quarter, retail volumes moved up by 5.9 per cent, aided by new models such as the new Velar and E-Pace and others such as the Discovery Sport and Ranger Rover Sport. 
While retail demand in the US and the UK picked up showing a 2-3 per cent volume growth, high incentives in the US and issues such as Brexit and uncertainty over government policy for diesel vehicles in Europe and the UK remain a concern. 
About 85 per cent of its vehicles sold in the UK and Europe are diesel vehicles.
However, JLR has a strong order book for about 5.5 months for the recently Iaunched I - PACE and about 3-4 months for the 2018 models of the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport. 
It is also expecting a comeback of demand in China from the ongoing July- September quarter onwards.

Tata Motors’ comeback story in the commercial vehicles (CV) segment is getting stronger with the company showing an increase in market share across categories in the June quarter, aided by strong double-digit sales growth.
“We have seen market share increase across segments — the medium and heavy commercial vehicle segment (M&HCV), intermediate and light commercial vehicle (ILCV) segment and in the small trucks segment. We are quite happy with the way the numbers are progressing and we hope to maintain the momentum,” PB Balaji, Group CFO, Tata Motors, told BusinessLine during a conference call. The company’s market share in the M&HCV has increased by 480 basis points to 60 per cent, aided by 111 per cent growth in sales at about 38,000 units during the first quarter of this fiscal. Its market share in the ILCV segment grew by 340 basis points to 46 per cent. Sales in this segment grew by 73 per cent to 11,700 units.
The company’s market share in the small CV and pick-up categories increased by 480 basis points to 41 per cent, supported by a 57 per cent growth in sales at about 46,900 units. 
Impact on demand 
Also, the company has registered strong growth in sales across regions — South: 57 per cent at 21,300 units; North: 69 per cent at 37,700 units; West: 63 per cent at 26,700 units and East: 85 per cent at 26,100 units.
Balaji indicated that the proposed truck axle norms may impact demand in the short term due to lack of clarity on various aspects. 
“I am expecting a temporary impact on demand during this quarter. But it should reverse out going forward as intrinsic demand for CVs is extremely high in the country. There is strong demand for tippers, trucks and last-mile vehicles because infrastructure spend is continuing and GDP growth is doing well. We are very bullish on demand over the medium- to long-term,” he added.
Even as the company awaits clarity on the new axle norms, it has started work on getting its trucks ready for them. “Three things have to be done — re-engineering, re-validation and re-certification, and we are on it,” he said."

Girish Wagh, President, Tata Motors Commercial Vehicle Business Unit




Girish Wagh, President, Tata Motors Commercial Vehicle Business Unit


As President of Tata Motors’ Commercial Vehicle Business Unit, Girish Wagh has little reason to complain with the industry seeing its best growth in recent times.
Yet, he is categorical that it is important not to let complacency come into the system and, instead, constantly push the envelope to stay ahead. “What we have been doing in the last year is to continuously improve the cost of operations of our products,” elaborates Wagh. 
This has included a sharp focus on enhancing fuel efficiency, not only in terms of when the vehicle gets certified, but also understanding various duty cycles. The products are then customised for that particular duty cycle as well as the customer concerned.
In addition, Tata Motors has deployed Dronas, a team of experts in specific fields, to follow up on fuel-efficiency complaints. According to Wagh, these Dronas accompany the customer/driver sometimes for over 2,000 kilometres to understand the driving pattern. “In many cases the solution is given then and there. 
The customer is told what to do to improve fuel efficiency,” he says. By the end of the day, the focus is on constantly attempting to understand customers better not only on product, but after-sales too. Prices of spares have also reduced in the drive to improve overall cost of ownership.
Customer experience
“There has been an overall drive to improve customer experience across vehicle segments. We need to do this if we have to stay relevant,” reiterates Wagh. The message is loud and clear: Tata Motors could be the market leader but it is important to keep its feet on the ground and not get carried away.
There is also a greater sense of becoming more proactive in reaching out to potential end-users and figuring out what their requirements may be. For instance, this could include a category like contractors bidding for road development projects where there is now greater “proactive engagement” in understanding what they are doing and how Tata Motors can help out in terms of spares, product modifications and so on. As Wagh says, this will go a long way in creating top-of-mind recall and even help bag new orders.
“We just cannot afford to be complacent especially in areas like costing,” he adds. What began with meeting challenging goalposts like Bharat Stage IV emission norms last year “is being continued into this year” while adding value and reducing costs. Today, there is a better understanding of what needs to be done to stay ahead of the curve.
In addition, there have been functional recasts carried out to improve product focus and ensure faster decision making. After all, Tata Motors has a huge range right from the small pick-up to the gigantic 49-tonne truck. For better managerial alignment, there are now four product lines with exclusive heads to take business decisions. 
“These guys spend a lot of time in the market, on engineering work and ensuring that the supply chain is aligned perfectly,” explains Wagh. As a result, there is a greater sense of ownership while strengthening the functional organisation (sales, purchasing, engineering, after sales) with leaders focussing on their specific areas. There is also more discipline in daily management going right up to the dealership level.
Passenger cars’ takeaways
Wagh was in the company’s passenger car business for many years and played a key part in the Nano’s evolution. Have those lessons come in handy for his new role in commercial vehicles? Beyond the cost focus and frugal engineering mantra, he believes some aspects in passenger vehicles like refinement and craftsmanship (especially in buses) will also be brought into commercial vehicles, albeit gradually. 
“Our product development process was more mature in passenger cars because of inputs from Jaguar Land Rover,” says Wagh. All these inputs have been taken into the commercial vehicle business “as a big pill where the outcome will be seen as we go ahead”. 
For now, the priority is to work relentlessly on new product development, innovations, service/value and cost reductions. There are five-year product plans that have been formulated with a greater sense of responsibility and focussing on a clear roadmap.
In the midst of this are occasional disruptions like the recent announcement on multi-axle loading where the Centre has advocated changes in carrying capacity. Wagh says this would mean “reengineering, revalidating and re-certifying” all vehicles, which will include careful examination of the entire anatomy right from steering, wheels and brakes to the engine and drivetrain.
“The organisation is on its toes and working to comply with this,” he adds. As in the case of BS IV, this is another disruption, which obviously the industry can do without especially at this stage when it has its hands full coping with the BS VI deadline from April 2020.
Wagh confines himself to saying that any company would welcome a carefully laid-out policy roadmap instead of disruptions. He believes it is a bit too early in the day to predict if the new loading rule will affect demand. 
Tippers are anyway overloaded so there should be no impact. On the other hand, both the big fleet owner and retail customers who resort to overloading are the categories that need to be studied in greater detail. “Perhaps there will be replacement demand with this new ruling and what kind of impact this will have on buying will vary from one segment to another,” says Wagh.
On a happier note, truck sales continue to be brisk thanks to infrastructure development especially in road-building and affordable housing. The consumption story is also going strong in segments like cars, two-wheelers and consumer durables coupled with the shift towards organised retail where small commercial vehicles are increasingly being used to home-deliver products.
The GST effect
The Goods and Services Tax introduced last July has also played a big role in the growth story. “In our case, we distribute both cars and small CVs through trucks. 
Our data shows that delivery times have reduced by 20 per cent,” says Wagh. While this is specific to Tata Motors, feedback from other transporters suggests that there has been an overall 10 per cent reduction in time.
“With this data, one can safely say that there has been a distinct improvement in transportation time. The focus on road-building and removal of physical barriers after GST has definitely helped. Yet, one of the bottlenecks is the time taken for loading and unloading, which however has nothing to do with GST,” says Wagh.
The Tata Motors’ CV chief is also categorical that there will be no dumping of vehicles as “it is not good for market health in the longterm”. In his view, customers have become smarter and look for the overall value of a CV and not just the price. “Of course, there are some who do negotiate with the initial price alone but we take our own calls whether to engage with this kind of buyer or not,” he adds.
While the sales momentum will continue to grow during the course of this fiscal and the next, it remains to be seen how demand will be impacted in the BS VI era when vehicles will become more expensive. 
Wagh concedes that any price increase will be a challenge but the inherent demand “will still be there” because of tailwinds like infrastructure, growth in agriculture and manufacturing, etc. 
“We need to understand how the transition will be less bumpy for transporters since his business case will be quite different. 
Even BS IV saw a significant price increase but there was demand anyway. By the end of the day, the CV industry is cyclical and we should be mindful of that,” declares Wagh."

bl13_bmmgn_Tata+bl13_auto_ravirisha.jpg


It was Tata Motors that ushered in truck racing in 2014 as an annual event where its Prima range would roar on the Buddh International Circuit in Greater Noida as crowds cheered on. Today, for all practical purposes, the T1 Prima Truck Racing Championship has been put on hold with the company looking at alternative options to improve driver dignity. The last race took place in March 2017.
“Driving is a difficult profession, which is looked down upon. Truck racing was one of the initiatives to engage with the driver and public at large,” says Girish Wagh, President, Commercial Vehicle Business Unit. 
While T1 is now in cold storage, Tata Motors is focussing on other initiatives focussed on driver dignity like training, scholarships for children and free medical check-ups. It was also a couple of weeks ago when the company emerged principal sponsor for the Wrestling Federation of India. 
As Wagh says, wrestling has brought “the maximum medals for the country” but hardly has any sponsors. As a sport, it has attributes like strength, agility and durability, which are synonymous with Tata commercial vehicles. 
“We saw good alignment with wrestling and decided to get into that arena along with doing something for that sport,” says Wagh. Clearly, the idea is to go beyond Prima truck racing and explore what makes “larger sense for the overall brand and all the stakeholders”. 
This also puts in context the company’s association as a team sponsor in the Pro Kabaddi League last year. As Wagh says, truck racing helped reach out to a “particular number of stakeholders” while some of the engagements “we are now doing will enable us to reach out to a larger number”. 
He reiterates that truck racing is a property that Tata Motors owns and it is up to the company to decide when it wants to revive the concept. “Racing made sense then and today we can bring more dignity through other means while doing it better, faster and on a larger scale,” says Wagh. 
As he makes clear, T1 is merely in pause mode at this point and not shelved. Within industry circles, the story going around is that the concept was scrapped because it was perceived as a costly exercise especially at a time when the truck industry was virtually down and out. There is no question that it played a part in brand-building for the Prima range especially with dealers and potential customers present in drives at the Buddh International Circuit. Now with the industry firing on all cylinders, it will be interesting to see if T1 will make a comeback. Going by what Wagh says, this could wait now and may not happen in a hurry."

Shares of Tata Motors slipped as much as three per cent as Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has issued a warning to the UK government of massive losses if Britain was to leave the European Union (EU).
JLR CEO Ralf Speth, who was speaking at the Zero Emission Vehicle Summit in Birmingham, on Tuesday had said that fears of a so-called “no-deal” Brexit and lack of clarity over Britain’s post-Brexit plans threatens the UK-based luxury carmaker’s entire operational set-up.

Interest in the Pro Kabaddi League has grown 33 per cent, making it the second-most popular and watched sports league on TV in India
   -  THE HINDU


 The sport has been termed modern, innovative and entertaining. And no, we are not talking about cricket. As Tata Motors inks a three-year sponsorship deal with Pro Kabaddi League as Associate Sponsor, and continues its association with the UP Yoddha team for the second year as its principal sponsor, the league is doing more than simply proving the commercial viability of the professional sport: It’s boosting the popularity of kabaddi overall.
According to Nielsen Sports, interest in kabaddi has grown by 14 per cent year-over-year since 2015, while interest in Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) has grown 33 per cent, making it the second-most popular and watched sports league on TV in India after the Indian Premier League. 
“Smart production and packaging of content on TV, alongside an innovative take on the construct, format and presentation of kabaddi has seen PKL transform how people are engaging, experiencing and enjoying the sport,” says Ravi Chavan, Managing Director, Nielsen Sports, India. 
From a commercial perspective, PKL has created a platform that is affording sponsors high returns on investment, which, in turn, has brought on a raft of leading brands. Balkrishna Industries (BKT), which deals in the off-highway tire market, inked a multi-franchise sponsorship deal in PKL, signing with seven of the 12 franchisees. BKT will come on board as the official tire partner for the seven marquee teams — Patna Pirates, Puneri Paltan, Tamil Thalaivas, Telugu Titans, UP Yoddha, Bengaluru Bulls and Haryana Steelers for the ongoing season.
The deal envisages BKT brand visibility on the official kits of these seven teams, apart from its presence across teams’ in-stadia branding. With the partnership, the BKT Group aims to not only support and sustain kabaddi to see talent grow, but also help populate the sport. IMG-Reliance, BKT’s sports consulting agency, played a key role in identifying and forging the partnership. Rajiv Poddar, Joint Managing Director, BKT Tires, notes since the viewership and followers for the teams has grown exponentially over the years, the decision to partner them was an easy one.
Talking about the impact of fitness in a three-month long league, Rishank Devadiga, Captain, UP Yoddha said: “Earlier the season was shorter, and the chances of injury were higher. With a three-month long league, there is enough time for players to rest and recuperate.”
Last season, Vivo, the Pro Kabaddi League’s title sponsor and a leading global smartphone brand, helped drive fans’ in-stadia experiences and commercial value of live sport attendance. Brands like Indo Nissin also partnered to promote kabaddi and engage the growing fanbase by launching its special edition Top Ramen packs across the country last season.
Aiming to promote and encourage sporting talent across India and overseas, the Commercial Vehicles Business Unit of Tata Motors’ partnership with PKL is a step in a similar direction.
Girish Wagh, President-Commercial Vehicle Business Unit, Tata Motors points out that games like kabaddi have always been at the forefront to connect with the masses. In India, an indigenous sport like kabaddi, that has been around for thousands of years, enjoys a considerable following among the masses. Unlike cricket though, its relatively recent and more mainstream counterpart, kabaddi does not garner the recognition and monetary compensation it warrants, says the company. By forging a three-year alliance with PKL, Tata Motors aims to alter this scenario.
Similarly, FMEG (Fast Moving Electrical Goods) company Syska Group, has partnered with Pro Kabaddi’s U Mumba Team as official grooming partner this year. Rajesh Uttamchandani, Director, Syska Group says the home-grown company is passionate about promoting Indian-origin sports and aims to encourage Indian athletes."

104,2018-11-01,Tata Motors,"Souped-up and raring to go
Just a few years ago, Tata Motors’ passenger car business seemed like it was headed on an irrevocably downhill path. Launched in quick succession, the Tiago, Tigor and the Nexon managed to put the brakes on the slide and have actually pulled the car-maker out of the woods. And, in what could be a case study on how quickly fortunes can change and allow a company to look beyond the ordinary, Tata Motors is now set to join the clique of car-makers that have a separate division to create serious performance versions of their stock cars.
Last week saw the launch of the Tiago JTP and Tigor JTP, two cars that have been developed by the joint venture Jeyam Tata Special Vehicles. The new JTP brand logo that will adorn the panels of these souped-up performance cars will represent Tata Motors’ attempt at creating something like a RS variant. And, unlike some of the competition cars, the JTP versions of the Tiago and Tigor will not just sport visual differentiators and a token retune of the engine, but will instead offer a significant improvement in driving dynamics and performance over the volume models. According to Tata Motors’ officials, the idea was to create performance-focussed cars that can also be driven everyday by regular car buyers. The target audience is a young buyer who is looking for the ‘joy of motoring’ in a commute car. 
 








 
 
So, do the Tiago and Tigor JTPs deliver on the promise? I went to Coimbatore, the home of Jeyam Automotives, the joint venture partner that has a history of prepping race cars, to test drive the new models.
The stock Tiago is already a good-looking hatch with elegant lines and near perfect proportions. What I’ve had reservations about has been it’s raised stance and small wheels. The Tiago JTP’s overall design is identical, but there are bits that identify this to be a special member of the team. The front fender features a new design with a larger air dam, a new bonnet grille design that also includes a polished black lipping and sports the JTP logo in one corner. The bonnet gets a small motorsport-style vent, which actually helps dissipate heat and is not just a cosmetic addition. The Tiago JTP, unlike the regular model, is much more sporty to look at due to a few subtle changes too. The car sits about 4 mm lower with a ground clearance of 166 mm and it sports larger, 15-inch wheels (compared to the stock version’s 14-inchers). The Tiago JTP also gets wider 185/60 tyres. At the rear, the fender is different too with the addition of a diffuser and also gets a twin exhaust — both of which are active and also help deliver a louder, and interesting exhaust note. The two JTP cars are being offered only in two body colours, Red and White, with contrast elements thrown into the mix such as black rear spoiler, door mirror housing and faux vents with the JTP logo located just behind the wheel arch on either side. These elements are painted a contrast red in the White body colour models. The smoked projector headlamps, polished black roof and the addition of the sideskirts add some more character to the exterior of the Tiago JTP. 
Compared to the regular Tigor, the JTP version gets the same set of additional exterior features that the hatch sports. Tata officials say that they’ll weigh the pros and cons of introducing JTP versions of future models and there is also the possibility of some of these vehicles being developed in parallel in the future. But, for now, the Tiago and Tigor seem to be good choices and it is to the credit of Tata’s impact design philosophy that the compact sedan looks as appealing, if not more than, the hatch. 
For the cabins of both the Tiago and the Tigor, Tata Motors’ developers have gone for an all-black interior theme with contrast colour elements in red. The steering is leather-wrapped and stitched in a racy red. The seats also feature the stitching and patterns in the same colour. Inserts for the aircon vents and even on the edges of the carpets make the cabin look different, but just about. The pedals are also adorned with drilled aluminium extensions and form part of the standard attempts at differentiating a sports car. I felt more could have been done, especially because inside the bonnet, the powertrain certainly feels more capable than the average sports variant.
For example, the seats could have been sportier with a deeper-set middle and bigger bolsters on the side. In fact, I’m sure there will be takers even for a race-spec lightweight sports seat for the driver and front passenger. The JTPs’ cabins are otherwise identical to the regular Tiago and Tigor. 
The overall equipment levels are comparable with other cars in the segment. The JTPs will of course, be offered only in one top trim level. But I hope JTSV, in addition to selling these cars through select Tata showrooms for ensuring a better purchase experience, will also offer buyers some customisation and individualisation options.
The Tiago and Tigor JTPs are powered by the same 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol engine that is offered in the Nexon; only in the JTPs, the mill is tuned to deliver 114 PS of peak power and 150 Nm of peak torque. Both intake and exhaust systems get performance enhancements and the five-speed manual gearbox gets a different set of ratios for taller pre-overdrive gears. Tata officials say that the JTPs are capable of doing 0-100 kmph in 10 seconds. The 1,199 cc, three-cylinder engine benefits substantially from the turbocharging and retune; it feels more refined and much more eager than the stock Tiago and Tigor’s powertrain. There is just a shade of lag, before much of the torque becomes available from about 1,800 rpm. In both the JTP models, the third gear is one of the best slots to be in with a wide power band offering seamless acceleration from a low of about 28 kmph to a high of 120 kmph. The top speed has been restricted to 160 kmph. The gearbox feels fairly crisp to shift, though there is still mild play in the gating. But, the JTP powertrain with its linear power delivery actually brings the fun factor into driving these cars, and is a reminder about how much more can be squeezed out of a small three-pot mill. 
The Tigor JTP’s cabin feels quieter and more settled in the right sort of way. The tuned exhaust note — a mild roar — can still be enjoyed, but turbo whine that is a bit intrusive in the Tiago JTP is snubbed out in the compact sedan. With better suspension mounts and a 50 mm longer wheelbase, the ride in the Tigor JTP is also better. The Tiago JTP feels a bit more edgy, making me wonder if it could have been lowered just a bit more with a tad less suspension travel to make it feel more connected to the tarmac. 
Tata Motors’ decision to still retain the model hierarchy in the ride quality and NVH departments for the JTPs is the only conservative bit in the mix. Both the JTPs are surprisingly fun to drive, and also look and feel special compared to the stock cars. Finally, buyers can expect to get a truly quick souped-up version without emptying their pockets. The Tiago JTP has been priced at ₹6.39 lakh and the Tigor JTP will retail for ₹7.49 lakh (both ex-showroom)."

Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
I have shares of Tata Motors at an average price of ₹347. Should I hold or sell them?
Kishore , Ranjith Anbalagan, Y Suneeta
Tata Motors (₹190): The long as well as intermediate-term trends are down for the stock of Tata Motors. But the near-term trend is up. Last week, the stock of Tata Motors gained 12 per cent, accompanied with above-average volume. Over the past four weeks, there has been an increase in volumes.
After recording a multi-year low at ₹164.5 on October 25, 2018, the stock changed direction, triggered by positive divergence in the daily indicators. Since then, it has been in a near-term uptrend. The stock has a significant long-term support in the ₹140-150 band.
 








 
Any decline below the immediate support level of ₹164 can find support in the long-term base. The relative strength index in the weekly chart is recovering from the oversold territory. Moreover, the daily RSI features in the neutral region with a positive bias and the daily price rate of change indicator hovers in the positive territory, depicting buying interest. Taking a contrarian stance, the short to medium term outlook is bullish for the stock.
Consider averaging the stock in declines while maintaining a long-term stop-loss at ₹140. A decisive break above the immediate resistance at ₹205 will strengthen the up-move and take the stock up to ₹250.
A further rally above ₹250 will pave way for an up-move to ₹275 and ₹300. Only a strong break above ₹300 will alter the intermediate-term downtrend and take the stock higher to ₹320 and then to ₹350 levels over the long run. Investors can consider taking profits if the stock struggles to move beyond ₹300 levels.

New Range Rover Evoque Convertible

New Range Rover Evoque Convertible
   -  Paul Noronha


A line in the sand. For many it is a metaphor for a fresh start. For Maurice and Spencer Wilks, it was a literal line in the sand that sparked not only a fresh start for a car manufacturer, but the beginning of a legend that lives to this day, 70 years on — Land Rover.
The idea for a ‘go anywhere, do anything’ car came about almost accidentally. Rover, the luxury car company, was looking for a change in direction. It was the mid-1940s, a post-war era where there was a need to export products in order to get the most out of their business. Many ideas were floated, but it was the military Jeeps used during the war that captured the imagination. 
Maurice Wilks resonated with this due to his love of the outdoors and active lifestyle. It was also important for the product to have export potential as a high rate of export was directly linked to the amount of steel the government would allocate to the company.
In order to facilitate the conversation, Spencer and Maurice Wilks met on the beach at Anglesey to discuss what kind of vehicle they would need to secure the future of the company. During the conversation, the outline of a vehicle was drawn in the sand, which took inspiration from the aforementioned military vehicles.
And so came to pass the concept of the Land Rover. This was the all-purpose vehicle that farmers, the military and anybody else who may find themselves negotiating rough terrain were looking for. 
There were some considerations to be had, such as protection from the weather — the military Jeeps were very basic vehicles with little or no comfort or features for the driver. They were also difficult to operate for an average driver, with levers to pull, buttons to press and processes to negotiate. The Land Rover Series I made all of this simplistic. 
The concept of the car was formed in October 1947. The vehicle was launched in April 1948. Vehicles were being sold to customers in August 1948. The Land Rover went from concept to sale within 10 months — the fastest production of a vehicle in history.
There was a heavy reliance on the Commonwealth for the initial export of the vehicles and assembly plants were set up in Melbourne and Calcutta. Parts manufactured in the United Kingdom would be shipped out to these plants where the vehicles would be put together. 
India has always had links with the Land Rover. There are records of the Indian military being offered the use of Land Rovers as military vehicles and the cars were prominent in the Darjeeling tea plantations as the preferred mode of transport.
While the Series I was the ultimate functional vehicle, it also had an element of pure entertainment about it. This was a car that could ‘go anywhere’ and ‘do anything’ in the words of Maurice Wilks. 
The advent of the Land Rover becoming a medium of adventure and discovery was basically an accident however. On the first annual Friends and Family Day, in April 1949 — a year in which 8,000 units were sold — rides were offered to children in the Series I. At least initially it was just for the children. 
By the end of the day, 4,000 people had an off-road driving experience in a Series I. This was the next phase of the marketing of the Land Rover, where for all its capability and durability, it was a whole lot of fun too.
By the end of the 1950s, sales had hit the 50,000 mark. A growing brand began to develop its portfolio, with the launch of the Range Rover in 1970, which was another leap for the company as they created a luxury vehicle with all the capability of a typical Land Rover. 
By then, Maurice Wilks had passed away and Spencer Wilks had retired and the decision was made to sell shares in the company to British Leyland who also had Jaguar in their portfolio alongside Triumph and Austin. The Discovery then joined the Land Rover family in 1989, at which point the Defender name had been introduced for the Land Rover 90” and 110” models. This completed the three Land Rover pillars that survive to this day.
The second generation Range Rover spawned the next sale of the company, as there was a desire for a new diesel engine for the car. BMW were able to supply the engine but bought the whole company in order to do so, buying Rover, Land Rover and Mini. 
BMW would go on to sell Land Rover to Ford to fund investment in other areas, including Formula One. It was at this point that Land Rover once again came across Jaguar, with Ford being the parent company of both brands.
Land Rover was again the pawn in a dire financial situation and the brand was sold to Tata Motors, along with Jaguar, who brought the two icons together to create Jaguar Land Rover. 
This started another period of growth for the company, with new models such as the Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Evoque. The smaller SUV segment that Evoque broke new ground on is now full of competitors who have followed the company’s lead.
Land Rover continues to plough its own furrow. The established family of pillars of Range Rover, Discovery and Defender stand out in front as leaders in refinement, capability and durability. The future holds many opportunities for the brand and if history is anything to go by, we simply will not be able to tell what they will come up with next.

Feature rich The top trim Harrier gets auto headlamps, rain-sensing wipers, six airbags, cornering fog lamps and reverse parking camera, but no sunroof option


Quite a few of the relics of the past were still there on campus; including the rickety Indigo XL, which I had just taken a ride in to reach Tata Motors’s sprawling Pune facility. The Tata-badged car that I tested on this track before the Harrier was the Nano. But the moment I set eyes on the orange Harrier that stood gleaming under the afternoon sun on the test track, all of Tata’s automotive misadventures of the past seemed to fade away.
Over the last few years, Tata Motors’s car business has risen from a low and the brand is back with a bang and in the reckoning. The Harrier though, promises to wield the power to really change your mind about the brand and its abilities; even more than the Tiago, Tigor and Nexon would have already. The Harrier isn’t just going to fill a gap in Tata’s portfolio, but will actually be the harbinger of a whole range of new vehicles that will be spawned from the OmegaArc platform (derived from the D8 architecture) that it has been built on. The Land Discovery uses the same basic architecture; and though some changes to the materials used have been made to keep costs down (like replacing aluminium with high-strength steel), essentially many of the underpinnings are identical in the Harrier too.
Walking around the Harrier gives me a better perspective of the design integrity and consistency of this fairly large SUV. Said to have been conceived by the in-house design team, with a lot of help from Trilix, the company’s Italian design studio, the Harrier is the best looking Tata ever. There is just that hint of the Discovery at the rear, but the Harrier is very different from anything I have seen. It is also quite remarkable that the design manages to stay so close to the H5X concept.
The front is the unconventional side of the Harrier. The high-set bonnet line has allowed designers the freedom to play with the front profile. The thin DRLs with turn indicators seem to sit at the conventional position for the headlamps, while the HID projectors themselves have been positioned below. Yet, set at the top of the huge front fender, the headlamps are still higher than on most sedans. The Harrier gets its own version of the humanity line and the X-element in the way the front fender is constructed. At the side, the big flared wheel arches combined with the black body cladding give it a strong SUV profile. The chrome finisher tracing the top of the doorline and ending at the rear quarter glass lends some uniqueness to the design.
The rear is a more tight package. The integrated roof spoiler and the 3D, layered design for the tailgate captures the essence of a modern SUV. The rear fender gets a larger section in black in keeping with a gradient theme. The faux exhaust finishers on either side of the faux diffuser in the rear fender are just that; the exhaust pipe itself is a short tube ending behind the fender.
The LED tubes in the tail-lights and the DRLs in the front combine to give the Harrier an awesome light signature at night. Overall, the exterior design of the Harrier is very appealing. The shut lines are tight, there are no design excesses and the build quality is nearly as good as any other in the price segment just north of ₹15 lakhs. The bits I didn’t like were some of the chrome trim elements and the excessive branding on the outside.
It is a fairly big SUV, and the Harrier’s cabin space reflects its body size. The first impression of the cabin’s build and quality is very good. There is a certain symmetry and clear design language to the dashboard layout. The curved design line that wraps on top of the dashboard running from one front door panel to the other communicates this consistency even better. The dashboard layout and ergonomics are spot on, the soft-touch top panel, the faux wood and aluminium inserts and the fake leather-wrapped bits are all excellent to touch and feel. Even some of the shiny plastic bits don’t feel cheap, but don’t feel too premium either. But on closer inspection, some of the knobs and handles feel a bit oversized or lacking in finesse like the rotary terrain response selector, the ‘aero-throttle’ style hand brake and the door handles.
The Harrier’s seats are great. The top trim I was testing sported the same Benecke Kaliko perforated leather-like upholstery. Nicely bolstered and with the right amount of firmness, they should be perfect for long journeys. The centre stack gives off the vibe of an SUV with its rotary knob, controls and thick handles on either side. The ‘floating island’ touchscreen infotainment system topping the stack is the most premium element in the cabin.
This HMI combo features a 8.8-inch, high-res (1600X600) infotainment touch screen and a seven-inch TFT screen in the instrument cluster that displays key drive-related information. The media system is a significant step up for Tata Motors and even for the segment.
It features an eight-speaker JBL set up with an external amplifier and sub-woofer producing an impressive output of 320 RMS. There is no embedded Nav system, but with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, using your smartphone for multiple functions including navigation won’t be a problem.
Mirroring between the infotainment and instrument cluster displays also makes it more versatile. Tata Motors is also offering an exclusive app called DrivePro, which is safety and efficiency focussed, and is expected to help drivers get an idea about how good their driving habits are.
For this, the system depends on reinterpreting ECU data for visually representing performance compared to benchmarks.
The Harrier is powered by the Fiat-derived Kryotec Diesel engine. There is no petrol engine on offer, for now. And the transmission choice is also only the six-speed manual (basically the Fiat C635), with individualised gear ratios and gating character compared to the Fiat gearbox. The two-litre diesel engine delivers 140 PS of power and 350 Nm of torque. This is inherently a quiet, refined engine with an uncharacteristically low diesel clatter even on the outside. There have been additional inputs for improving NVH characteristics, including hydra mounts for the engine and front suspension, auxiliary isolation panels have also been used for the firewall, and an isolated front suspension subframe further reduces suspension related noise. There is also more technology in the engine like the light weight, low friction valve train to lower operational noises.
Even at peak revs, the powertrain feels agile and isn’t sluggish like a mis-paired underpowered unit struggling to pull a behemoth. The electronically controlled variable geometry turbocharger does its job, ensuring that power and torque delivery are quite linear with only just a hint of lag. The gearbox has been given tall lower gears, so fewer gear shifts may be needed. The shift feel is also good with none of the rubbery, notchy gating that the previous cars suffered from.
 
 








 
The Harrier gets both Drive modes and Terrain modes. Like in the case of the Nexon, the drives modes are Eco and Sport, with the City mode being the default selection. Mapping is similar in character to the other models, though it has been customised to suit the Harrier and its Kryotec engine and the Fiat gearbox. The Sport mode seems to be the most suitable, with its mapping allowing the Harrier to breathe better and take quicker strides. Terrain modes only use a mix of assistance provided by the electronic aids in the Harrier to just marginally alter its response to changes in driving conditions. They include Normal, Rough Road and Wet. Since there is no four-wheel drive option being offered at the moment (Tata officials say that there will be a 4X4 version later in the Harrier’s life-cycle), the drive modes simply depend on a varying cocktail of assistance from electronic stability control, cornering control and electronic brakeforce distribution to improve response. There is no change to the suspension or steering response. But the interesting bits are the inclusion of brake disc wiping to avoid fade and the fact that the Harrier gets an impressive 450 mm of water wading capability.
The Harrier’s suspension geometry is very similar to the Discovery Sport’s. The front is almost identical, but rear suspension set up has been changed to make it hardier and focussed for the rough and tumble of Indian driving conditions. Tata engineers got considerable assistance from Lotus Engineering of UK for tuning the rear suspension. I found the ride quality to be a bit over-pliant, even wallowy at times. There is a bit of body roll, but it is clear that the Harrier benefits immensely from the monocoque construction and inherently rigid structure of the D8 platform. Handling is still good, though not in the same league as some of the SUVs in the ₹20-lakh plus category. I’d have liked the Harrier’s steering to offer more centre weight; but the chunky wheel offers a nice grip and is adequately precise around corners. The Harrier’s top speed has been restricted to 170 kmph. During my drive, the test mule’s real-time mileage display showed a fuel efficiency range from about 8.9 kmpl to about 13.1 kmpl. The Harrier is by far the best that has rolled out of Tata’s stables. It has a long list of additional safety and convenience features including hill-hold control and off-road ABS. As a package, it is compelling, despite some of the rough edges in the cabin and handling characteristics. But Tata shouldn’t out-price the Harrier. My estimate for it would be an ex-showroom price range of ₹12-16 lakhs."

Warren Harris, CEO and MD, Tata Technologies
   -  BL


Tata Technologies, a subsidiary of Tata Motors, is synonymous with innovation in the outsourced engineering space. CEO and Managing Director, Warren Harris, talks about the company’s journey and the way ahead in an interview. Excerpts:
Would you agree with the view that Tata Technologies (TTL) is the best kept secret among Tata group companies?
Yes, I certainly do, if you take a look at what we do. There are really two proponents of the value proposition: one is outsourced engineering services and the other is helping manufacturing companies select and deploy the technology on which new products are built.
In the engineering services space, we have 10-11 electric vehicle premiums outsourced to TTL. In the Indian private sector, there are hardly any such engineering services companies.
Typically, we compete and go toe-to-toe with full-service providers from Germany and the United States. So it is an exceptional capability that exists here in India and the respect we have garnered with the customers. So, yes, we are the best kept secret of the industry.
Could you go back to the time when Ratan Tata set up this company?
Mr Tata said in late-1997, when the company was formed, that he did not want it to be ‘all things to all people’ but very specifically focussed on the manufacturing sector. He challenged us to gain the respect of the manufacturing sector not just here in India but around the world.
I just spoke to our employees at the Diwali celebration and profiled some of the things we do worldwide and the relationships we have got in and around disruptions in terms of electrification, connected vehicles and autonomous driving.
I don’t believe we will ever claim that we have arrived as far as Mr Tata’s challenge is concerned but I am very proud of the progress that we have made towards the goal he set out when he formed the company.
Does this include the fact that three of four engineers who put together the Nano were from TTL?
You are very well informed! When Mr Tata put together the team to develop Nano, he wanted it to be young, creative and think outside the box. He then took four engineers, three were from our company, and one from Tata Motors.
The team did a lot of the original concept work undertaken for the Nano. When the concepts were crystallised and the development plan formalised, TTL provided 65 per cent of the resources. So, we are very proud of the achievement despite the fact that the product hasn’t been a commercial success.
From an engineering and innovation perspective to develop a vehicle for $2,500 is remarkable. What we were able to do was to take our frugal innovation capabilities developed on that programme and leverage those to other engagements.
I was on a panel in New York a couple of years ago where I told the story of the Nano. Seated next to me was the chief executive of an organisation that sells beverages and ships refrigerating units. He told me that if we could develop a car for $2,500, we could help him develop a cheaper refrigerating unit.
We were able to get the most out of the units and reduce costs by 30 per cent. So here is an example of how the Nano experience was applied to other development projects.
Would this then be your credo going forward? Developing low-cost machines that are extremely efficient?
I think everyone is cost-conscious and doing more for less is what all good companies like to practice. But increasingly our business is not driven by making something cheaper than anybody else but by our ability to innovate, our capabilities, and by the relationships we have.
A few years ago, an entire project would have the OEMs making the decisions and the supply chain fulfilling those in what was a command-and-control relationship. Today, it has become much more of an ecosystem.
There is a requirement and responsibility to co-innovate, exert ownership over the end solution with OEMs having a much greater appetite to outsource, what three-four years ago they would exclusively own and control.
How have such collaborations helped?
If you look at the electric vehicle space, for instance, the number of parts has substantially reduced and the whole supply chain is getting disrupted. The need for suppliers has also reduced.
Everyone is having to innovate by the business model perspective in terms of products and relationships (with other organisations). I think those organisations that are prepared to make the big bet on where the industry is going will ultimately succeed.
How would you then react to the case of electric scooter maker, Ather Energy, grappling with a global shortage of electronic parts?
I think it is more of a commodity challenge. I also think that shortages and capacity (or the lack of it) at different stages of the markets drive innovation. If you take a look at what is happening in the battery world there is a move from lithium ion to solid-state batteries in some geographies. There are a number of academic institutions investigating solid-state batteries and you will see the chemistry and the products evolve with the availability of resources and politics.
Do you think India is up to the challenge of electric mobility?
I think the Government needs to be applauded in terms of messaging. They have signalled that they want 30 per cent penetration by 2030 but different ministries are sending out mixed messages, which makes it difficult for the industry to make long-term plans.
It takes three-four years to develop a vehicle and if you are going to make those big bets, then I think there is an issue there. India is a price-sensitive market and the cost of batteries are still very high for pervasive penetration of EVs.
Therefore, we are not seeing the same kind of investments or dynamics taking place in China for instance. Every time I go to China there is a new entrant committing to build an EV and we are seeing massive growth in that market."

Tata Motors domestic market share slipped to 3-3.5 per cent few years ago




Tata Motors domestic market share slipped to 3-3.5 per cent few years ago


Bucking the general slow growth in the country’s automotive sector, Tata Motors Limited has grown by over 20 per cent in the first nine months and expects to close the current financial year with a market share of about seven per cent.
The automotive major, whose domestic market share had once slipped to 3-3.5 per cent few years ago, has gained share and is now looking to further consolidate its domestic business, as it launches new models and addresses segments where it is currently not present.
Mayaank Pareek, President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors said, “Thus far during the current financial year, it has been challenging to the automotive sector. It has been growing at about 4.4 per cent. However, we have grown by over 20-21 per cent aided by new launches.”
Speaking to Business Line on the sidelines of the launch of their latest offering, a versatile Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV), Tata Harrier, derived from Land Rover’s D8 platform here today, the Tata Motors President said, “We are, currently, present in a smaller addressable market of about 16 per cent. In the next few years we plan to take this up to 90 per cent of the market with the launch of few more vehicles. This will enable us to further consolidate our presence and market share.”
The focus continues on growing the domestic market both in urban and rural areas. The rural market holds immense scope for growth, he said.
Stating the next major launch will be in the second quarter of next fiscal, Pareek said the country’s automotive sector is passing through several major changes, which includes the need to transition to BS VI norms from April 1, 2020.
“This will call for various players in the automotive sector to brace up for this change. Such a transition will lead to further price escalation of both petrol and diesel cars as they would have to conform to BS VI norms. While oil marketing companies are bracing up to provide fuels that meet the new norms, the automotive sector will have to brace up for these changes, particularly to upgrade engines to meet these stringent norms,” he explained.
“At Tata Motors, we have the technology to brace up to these requirements and expect to be BS VI norms ready much ahead of the schedule April 1, 2020. But, significantly, the sector players would have to align their manufacturing so that they do not end up with BS IV norm vehicles as on March 31, 2020,” he said.
“Tata Motors has come up with 5-6 new models over the past few years and plans to take this up to 12-14 vehicles, which will enable us to cover 90 per cent of the country’s addressable market for passenger vehicles. This will enable us to further consolidate,” he said.
Referring to coming demand for electric vehicles in the country, Pareek said, “As a company we have technology to cater to this. We have been chosen by EESL for supply of e-vehicles. However, the challenge is to have a support infrastructure for charging. Today’s situation in the EV segment is like having petrol cars without petrol.”
Pareek said, “The response for Harrier is overwhelming.”"

   -  REUTERS


For the third straight quarter this fiscal, Tata Motors has posted weak numbers, clocking a consolidated loss of ₹26,961 crore for the three months ended December 2018. In the June and September quarters, the company had incurred losses of ₹1,000-1,800 crore. 
While the domestic standalone business made profits of ₹618 crore in the December quarter, the huge loss came from writing down of the value of certain product development costs that were capitalised as well as the value of certain tangible assets such as property, plant and equipment at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). This writedown was done to the extent of £3.1 billion ( ₹28,014 crore).
However, even without considering this exceptional charge, JLR was on a slippery wicket, clocking a loss before exceptional items of £273 million (approximately ₹2,500 crore). Like in the previous quarters, the downturn in China took a toll on the company in the third quarter. 
While JLR clocked good retail volume growth (over Q3 FY18) the quarter) in North America and Europe, the company reported a 6.4 per cent drop in total retail sales during Q3 FY19 due to a steep drop of 47 per cent in China volumes. 
Thus, JLR revenues fell about 1.4 per cent year-on-year to £6,223 million (approx ₹57,300 crore). Its Ebitda margins dipped to 7.3 per cent this time, compared to the 10.9 per cent clocked a year ago. 
High depreciation and amortisation costs, high incentives in China to push up sales and production shutdown during the quarter were the main reasons for the shrinkage in margins.
While the long-term potential for premium cars in China remains sanguine, the slowdown in China could continue to impact JLR in the near term. The company is trying to make the best out of the situation there by focusing on improving dealer profitability, narrowing discounts as well as enhancing local sourcing. 
Besides, JLR is focussing on bettering its cash flows and profitability. The latest impairment of certain assets, for instance, is expected to bring down depreciation and amortisation costs by £300 million (approx ₹2,600 crore) per annum. Similarly, to cut down employee costs, JLR announced a workforce reduction scheme with a target of cutting down 4,500 workers last month. 
These apart, a better product mix could do its bit to drive sales in the coming months. The company is launching the all-new Range Rover Evoque, which comes with mild and plug-in hybrid options. The Jaguar I-PACE, introduced in 2018 in select markets, is now launched globally and sports an encouraging order book. A new Defender will also be launched this year. 
A ‘No-deal’ Brexit, though, remains a dampener as it could impact the import of components into UK for manufacturing, as well as the export of vehicles to global markets."

Tata Motors shares had their biggest drop in 26 years. File Photo


 Tata Motors Ltd shares had their biggest drop in 26 years after the company posted a record loss in Indian corporate history because of a writedown in its luxury Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc unit.
The stock drop of as much as 30 per cent was the biggest since February 1993 on intraday basis and sent Tata Motors shares to their lowest level in almost a decade. The net loss was ₹26,960 crore in the three months through December, exceeding the deficit reported by Indian Oil Corp. in 2012.
Plummeting sales in China are compounding Jaguar Land Rovers challenges that include the industry’s shift away from vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel, a stronghold for the company. Its heavy production presence in the UK exposes it to a disorderly Brexit, the likelihood of which has risen over the past few weeks, Fitch Ratings said this week. The rating company has placed Tata Motors on negative credit watch.
The overall performance continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in China, Ralf Speth, head of Jaguar Land Rover, said in a statement on Thursday. We continue to work closely with Chinese retailers to respond to current market conditions.
Tata Motors shares were down 15 per cent at Rs 155.40 as of 9:38 am. They had already slumped more than 50 per cent in the past 12 months through Thursday on concerns about Jaguar Land Rovers waning sales, profitability, high capital-expenditure need and the impact of Brexit.
Carmakers around the planet are getting hurt by the slump in China, whose car market shrank for the first time in more than two decades last year. Daimler AG and BMW AG reduced profit forecasts last year amid pressures from the US-China trade war that’s hit auto demand, while Hyundai Motor Co. said last month its letting workers go as it reviews production plans in the worlds biggest market.
Jaguar Land Rover said its overhauling its China operation, cutting back on deliveries to reduce stock. Its also streamlined its commercial policies to help compensate for retailers losses, and launching extensive on-site training programs to improve the customer experience as well as operations.
Tata Motors wrote down its investment in Jaguar Land Rover by $3.9 billion due to market challenges, especially in China, technology disruptions and rising debt costs. The parents net loss compared with a profit of Rs 12 billion a year earlier, and also missed the average analyst estimate that called for a profit.
Tata Motors has bitten the bullet, Ajay Bodke, the Mumbai-based head of investment strategy at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd. said by phone. They are reinforcing that they are serious about achieving a turnaround, saving costs and taking measures that might be tough.
As part of Jaguar Land Rovers plans to achieve 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) of investment, working capital and profit improvements by March 2020, the company in January said it would slash its global workforce by 4,500. This is expected to result in a one-time exceptional redundancy cost of around 200 million pounds for the luxury unit of Tata Motors. The cost of the voluntary scheme will be recognized in the quarter ending March 31, the company said."

83,2019-02-14,Tata Motors,"‘We need to keep the momentum going at Tata Motors’
Guenter Butschek completes three years as CEO and Managing Director of Tata Motors on Friday. It has been a tenure marked by transformation across the ecosystem, which has seen the company emerge a lot stronger from what it was when he took charge.
“If you go to Tata Motors today and compare it to what I inherited three years ago, it is a different entity. People from all layers know what the organisation is all about, they are aware of their contribution to targets in the overall scheme of things, and they have taken a proactive approach in the journey,” says Butschek.
More importantly, employees have started to own the transformation journey and embrace the cultural change. As he adds, it is an inclusive/comprehensive approach that “started with ourselves” before the effort spread to other areas like quality improvement, service improvement, cost optimisations, etc.
Beyond product, continues Butschek, there has been “tremendous progress” in after-sales service, customer satisfaction and so on. The transformation journey kicked off in 2016 and encountered a lot of disruptions along the way in the form of demonetisation, the transition from Bharat Stage III emission norms to BS IV and the Goods and Services Tax. 
This meant that the company also needed to keep pace and, therefore, shift gears from the originally intended transformation exercise to a turnaround effort. “People generally think that this (turnaround) is pretty much a financial exercise but for us it was about changing the Tata Motors culture,” says Butschek. 
It was also about soaking this idea into the DNA of the company and to ensure that the entire organisation was on its toes to drive change. The Tata Motors chief still remembers the time in September 2016 when he made it clear to the employees that they could not blame volatility alone as the reason for the company not being able to perform to its potential. 
“This is because volatility is largely out of our control and is a reality as well. We needed to be blamed for not being able to cope with volatility because the enemy was within us,” says Butschek. The solution, therefore, was to manage volatility more effectively by being extremely agile and flexible in the overall response. 
Hence, if there was a structural change in the market, it was important to have enough intelligence “brought into the plate to foresee these developments” in order to have alternative scenarios ready. 
This could include new goalposts like moving from BS IV to BS VI in April 2020 and still being able to understand the potential impact in terms of customer sentiment, product pipeline, etc. “Your planning needs to be longterm and you need to have enough agility to steer the big boat like a speedboat in order to manage volatility,” stresses Butschek.
All the hard work paid off during the electric vehicle drive when the company had to supply cars to the Government entity, Energy Efficiency Services Limited. The timeline was short but a special team was formed that pulled out all the stops to make this task a reality. What was clearly evident in this exercise was a “strong sense of purpose and ownership”. 
It is this trait that has clearly pleased Butschek and he reminds you that while mass movement is the recipe of any kind of transformation, ownership is the “key ingredient”. If this is not present, the efforts are not going to pay off.
From Butschek’s point of view, the turnaround exercise at Tata Motors will always be a work in progress even while it has gone through a nomenclature change from Turnaround 1.0 to 2.0 “We need to keep the momentum going and this will be the new mentality and DNA of Tata Motors,” he says. 
And even while there could possibly be a Turnaround 3.0 drive going forward, the bottomline is that the new culture is now fully embedded in the ecosystem and is the way forward. What is even more interesting is that this exercise has now gone beyond the company’s borders to its suppliers who will now be part of the journey as they move to the next level in competencies. 
By the end of the day, it is important to have solid engineering competencies in place to be able to pull off effective local solutions for the market. In short, this means getting the next set of technologies into a “much more comprehensive cost envelope”. 
As Butschek reiterates, mere “copy paste” does not work for India and will not help transiting to the next level. “We need to make mobility sustainable and affordable, which means Tata Motors needs to be in the forefront here in terms of being competitively priced with solutions,” he says.
It is also in this context that Butschek is pleased with the effort that has gone into the recently launched Harrier SUV. It is keeping in line with the promise made two years ago that the future of Tata Motors’ passenger vehicles would be based on two architectures: Alpha and Omega. 
This was important from the viewpoint of launching more vehicles in shorter time, which would be enabled by commonality, modularity and economies of scale. The Omega architecture is the one on which Harrier is based and it is the first product of the new strategy.
Butschek says Harrier has even more significance since it is going to lead the passenger vehicles journey at Tata Motors from the past to the present “and into the future”, which effectively reflects a change from a value to premium position. 
This new positioning is important since it sends out a strong statement that the company has come through a turnaround and a revival of its brands in order to claim a new position in the market. “The point that comes with Harrier is that all of a sudden, it will have a huge knockdown effect on other vehicles as well,” explains Butschek. 
In the process, people will be compelled to buy something premium that meets global requirements. More importantly, it marks the successful result of the turnaround exercise where, beyond market share, the change is now more visible on the product front in terms of design, styling, features and safety.
“We are now ready to take things to the next level with the new chapter. It is already drafted and the middle of the year will see the first product from the Alpha architecture,” says Butschek. The important thing is that it is on schedule and, eventually, there will be a family of products rolling out in quick time. 
“Harrier is the first part of the transformation at Tata Motors and the opening of a new chapter to say that we are stronger than ever. This product demonstrates our strength as well as our confidence about the future,” reiterates Butschek.
Will there be another shot at collaboration on the lines of what was announced with Volkswagen at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show? Eventually, things did not go according to plan even while big things were conceived initially. The Tata Motors chief’s response is that it is important to be “alert and open” to more opportunities for reasons of technology and scale."

Over the next two years, at least 5000-7000 e-buses are expected to ply (across different vehicle makers) in India. So the company intends to strengthen its presence not just through a better product range, but is also exploring different business models.
According to Rohit Srivastava, Product Line Head, Passenger Commercial Vehicles, Apart from supply to State governments, Tata Motors is also exploring the possibility of fleet replacement at big corporate houses. So the company will look at replacing a conventional fuel run bus of corporate with an electric bus. Talks have been initiated with some four to five such large entities.
“Detailed discussions are on. We are open to offering our electric buses to these big corporate houses that provide staff transportation facilities. But, things like replacement cycle (of existing vehicle with a new one) has to coincide,” Srivastava told BusinessLine.
Tata Motors is open to discussions with private fleet operators. But, as of now, not many have expressed interest. Things like charging of the vehicle during long trips and availability of charging stations are still being worked out, market sources said.
Buses are being manufactured at Dharwad in Karnataka and around 125 vehicles can be made on a monthly basis at the facility.
“Production capacities are flexible and can be doubled to 250-300 vehicles per month depending on demand,” Srivastava said.
Typically, an electric bus of Tata Motors can run 150 kms with a single charge. There will be options to ‘top-up the vehicle’s battery’ in charging points across specific depots. For the State government projects, that the company is undertaking, charging points would be in depots itself.
State government projects
The company has bagged orders to supply 255 e-buses from six state transport undertakings under the first phase of incentive scheme for electric vehicles in public transport.
Under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicles scheme, announced by the Centre, Tata Motors won 60 per cent of the orders.
The company will supply 80 buses to Kolkata, (to West Bengal Transport Authority) 40 buses each to Jammu, Indore, Lucknow and Jaipur, and 15 buses to Guwahati.
As of now, 20 buses have been supplied to Kolkata and the remaining 60-odd will be supplied soon. This apart a pilot run is being carried out in Lucknow and Indore.
“Pilot-run in other cities will also start soon. The nature of the contract mandates that a trial run be carried out before the electric vehicles start plying,” Srivastava said.
Apart from Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Volvo and some other OEMs have electric buses."

72,2019-04-28,Tata Motors,"Ready for electric vehicles? 
 
The auto sector has been in the thick of action in recent times, with worries over pollution and the need to switch over to electric vehicles (EVs) over the next decade, occupying the centre-stage. With the country taking steps towards establishing the eco system for EVs, it has become imperative for vehicle manufacturers to come up with their plans and for auto component makers to redraw theirs, to suit the new order. How are auto-makers placed to usher in this revolution? And, if you have listed auto and auto component stocks, are your holdings EV-proof?
Moves such as the ban on diesel/petrol vehicles over 10/15 years old from entering NCR, the Supreme Court’s decision to not extend the time line for adoption of BS IV standard fuel across the country and the government’s decision to jump directly to BS VI emission norms by 2020, show that India is getting more and more serious about curbing vehicle pollution.
The most ambitious of all the measures is the plan to switch over to electric vehicles by 2030. A paper titled “India Leaps Ahead: Transformative Mobility Solutions for all” put out by the Niti Aayog (the nodal agency for the EV move) in May 2017 lays out a roadmap to 2030. It bats for 100 per cent electrification of three-wheelers, four-wheeler (commercial) and public transport vehicles, while aiming for 40 per cent electrification in two-wheelers and four-wheelers used for personal transport.
According to the report, if the above mix is achieved, India’s emissions are expected to decline by 37 per cent by 2030. Similarly, energy requirement for transport will come down 64 per cent from what will be required if the current scenario continues until 2030.
 










 
The government has taken this vision forward in Phase II of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid&) Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme which provides demand incentives for EV purchases from April 1, 2019.
Since the costs of EVs tend to be high, demand incentives ranging from ₹20,000 per vehicle for buyers of e-two wheelers to ₹50 lakh per vehicle for e-bus buyers over a period of three fiscal years (initially) is being provided to bring down the end price to customers.
FAME II is in sync with the government’s goal of 100 per cent electrification of public transport by 2030, as it predominantly encourages only electric technology and in that, only lithium ion battery or other newer technology battery-based vehicles; besides, e-buses and e-three-wheelers hog more than half the allocations under FAME, batting for environment-friendly mass transport system. FAME apart, concessional GST rates of 12 per cent is already being provided for EVs to bring down the cost for customers. Conventional fuel vehicles now attract GST rates of 28-50 per cent. Tariffs on imported parts of EVs have also been reduced.
To enable manufacturers lower the production cost, state governments are coming out with various incentives for locating manufacturing units in their States — Karnataka Maharashtra and Uttarakhand are examples. State government policies also provide support for setting up charging infrastructure as well as concessions through various means for customers.
 








 
 
Considering that a wide network of public-charging infrastructure is the very backbone of any mass shift to EVs, the Ministry of Power has been taking various measures to set up charging infrastructure through public sector undertakings such as NTPC. Guidelines and standards for setting up such infrastructure were put out by the Ministry in December 2018. A charging station at every 25 km on both sides of roads/highways is mandated. A phased roll out over the next five years is envisaged.
Besides, to popularise EVs, the Centre has started procuring electric cars for government use through Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), while various state governments have put out their own electrification/procurement targets over the next few years under their respective EV policies.
Thus, the ecosystem is slowly, but surely, growing roots. Seen in the light of lowering lithium-ion battery costs over the last few years and the fact that ISRO has indigenously developed lithium-ion battery technology, these moves indicate that mass production and mass adoption of EVs could indeed be a reality by 2030. Given this scenario, auto makers are leaving no stone unturned to jump on to the EV bandwagon.
Among listed auto players, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is in a comfortable position, being one of the earliest entrants into the EV space through the acquisition of Reva Electric in 2010. Today, the company has come a long way, offering a range of EVs across cars (E2O Plus, eVerito ), three-wheelers (e-ALFA, Treo) and small goods vehicles ( eSupro).
 








 
 
Besides, it will also unveil the electric version of its popular compact SUV KUV 100 in mid-2019. M&M is among the companies supplying EVs for government use through EESL, with an initial order for about 4,800 eVeritos (costing ₹10-15 lakh)
FAME II’s preference for cars used in fleet operations will further benefit the company as M&M has already been partnering with Ola, Zoomcar and Meru for fleet operations. Having entered the fray quite early, the company is now on its second leg of expansion in the EV space. Towards this, it has invested an initial ₹500 crore at its Chakan plant under the new EV policy of the Maharashtra Government. In the second phase of expansion, the company will further ramp up manufacturing and charging infrastructure, develop new, high-end electric powertrains as well as battery technology. Electric mobility is also an area where Mahindra is working in partnership with Ford Motors to develop new products, platforms and other solutions.
Tata Motors is not far behind, having launched its electric bus and electric version of the Tigor passenger car. The buses are currently being sold to government transport undertakings in West Bengal, Jammu, Jaipur, Lucknow, Indore and Guwahati. Though private sale of the e-Tigor has not yet commenced, like M&M, the company is supplying 5050 e-Tigors to EESL (costing ₹10-15 lakh) for government use. Electric versions of small trucks/commercial passenger vehicles such as the Super Ace, Magic Iris and Magic have also been showcased. Thanks to the EV wave across the globe, Tata Motors also has Jaguar Land Rover to lean on for technology support. The all electric Jaguar I-PACE has gone on sale recently. JLR has also announced that all its launches from 2020 will be electrified.
Other listed players — Maruti Suzuki and Ashok Leyland — have taken the partnership route to developing EVs. Throwing its hat in the ring only after the announcement of the government’s 2030 deadline, Maruti Suzuki’s EVs will be co-developed by the global partnership between Toyota and parent company Suzuki, leveraging on the former’s strength in electrification technology and the latter’s strength in making compact vehicles. The company’s first EV is expected to be launched in 2020. Suzuki is also setting up a lithium ion battery plant at about ₹1,100 crore in Gujarat in a joint venture with Toshiba and Denso.
Ashok Leyland already has access to EV technology through its UK-based subsidiary Optare. Last September, the company set up an electric mobility centre in its Ennore plant with facilities for engineering, prototyping and testing for motors, battery modules and packs. This apart, the company has tied up with several organisations (predominantly start-ups) to further its EV inroads in areas such as battery, range extenders and power electronics. For instance, it has joined Sun Mobility, which specialises in smart batteries and quick recharge stations.
Ashok recently introduced the Circuit S e-bus, powered by battery technology from Sun. About 50 of these will be supplied to Ahmedabad Janmarg for intra-city transport. An electric version of its smaller commercial vehicles is also on the cards.
Eicher Motors too has launched its electric buses and is working with its partner Volvo, on a range of public transport options.
Electric two-wheelers have been leading the EV market so far, accounting for over 90 per cent of the country’s EV sales. But the scene is currently dominated by unlisted players. Listed players such as Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto have their tasks thus cut out for meeting the 2030 deadline.
To fast track its EV plunge, Hero MotoCorp has invested in Ather Energy — an IIT-Madras incubated start-up — and has also set up its R&D facility for electric mobility in Jaipur. Ather brought out two e-scooters — the 340 and 450 — in 2018 priced at over ₹1 lakh.
For TVS, the Creon e-scooter is on the cards. While it has also show-cased an electric three-wheeler concept, it is working with another start-up Ultraviolette Automotive for developing premium two-wheelers. Bajaj Auto’s e-scooter — Urbanite — will debut this year. It is also launching e-three-wheelers. Eventually, its Qute quadricycle may also offer an electric option.
Thus, all major listed players are doubling their efforts in a race to meet the government’s 2030 deadline. But despite the incentives, affordability will be an important factor for mass adoption of EVs — be it for personal or commercial use. Making frugal, but reliable, vehicles will be the challenge for the Indian market.
Maruti Suzuki, TVS Motors, Bajaj Auto and Hero Moto Corp — companies focusing on the price-sensitive segments such as commuter bikes and compact cars — will be more vulnerable here. Higher localisation and economies of scale, along with lower battery prices, are key to bringing down the costs. Stiff competition from the large number of unlisted auto makers in India such as Hyundai and Honda — which have a sizeable market share and are also developing EVs with equal enthusiasm — will be a threat to all listed players.
Overall, an interesting decade lies ahead for auto stocks. From being an old economy sector in the last decade or more, the space will be in the spotlight once again over the next ten years. Investors need to keep a close watch on company-specific developments in the EV front, as it may define the prospects for stocks from now on.
With EVs all set to revolutionise the auto industry, it becomes imperative for auto component makers to chalk out their strategies for supplying parts to EVs. The key difference in the EV regime will be the replacement of the internal combustion (IC) engine, transmission and drivetrain parts with batteries, motors and other electronic components. Hence, suppliers of parts such as cylinder blocks/heads, pistons, valves, shafts, fuel injection, clutches, axles, gears, radiators, coolants and lubricants will be impacted. Many companies have begun drawing up their EV strategies to counter this risk of obsolescence.
Global auto component major Bosch, a supplier of fuel injection systems to IC engines worldwide, is gearing to meet this challenge both in India and abroad. The company has developed an integrated electrification system, including motor, control unit, battery and charger that can power two-, three- and four-wheelers.
Bharat Forge, which supplies powertrain parts, is also developing products for EVs. It has set up an EV R&D centre in the UK and has picked up stake in Tork Motorcycles, a drivetrain company focused on electric two-wheelers. It has also invested in Tevva Motors (Jersey), a company that provides electric powertrain solutions to commercial vehicles. Mahindra CIE, another powertrain supplier, is also working with global and Indian clients on their EV portfolio.
With the government focusing on electrifying buses, three-wheelers, two-wheelers and cars initially, companies which supply to trucks are shielded from the move to EVs. Clutch-maker Setco Automotive and steering gear supplier ZF Steering, for instance, supply predominantly to trucks, although they earn some portion of revenues from other vehicle segments. Suspension product-maker Jamna Auto Industries, lighting suppliers Lumax Industries and FIEM Industries, makers of shock absorbers such as Gabriel India and Munjal Showa, and tyre makers are other players that are not impacted negatively by EVs in a big way. Wiring harness-makers such as Motherson Sumi will be impacted positively, as EVs are expected to have higher wiring content per car.
But listed lead-acid battery makers such as Exide and Amara Raja Batteries are in the direct line of fire. But they are taking steps to reinvent themselves to suit the lithium ion battery regime that EVs demand. Exide has tied-up with Lechlance SA based in Switzerland to build these batteries for Indian EVs and is setting up a plant in Gujarat.
Though Amara Raja Batteries had announced the setting up of an assembly plant for lithium ion batteries, the recent termination of its relationship with technology partner Johnson Controls is a worry. Plans of auto manufacturers to set up their own battery plants of EVs also heightens the competition for these two players."

69,2019-05-05,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors may drop small diesel cars from its portfolio 
Auto major Tata Motors likely to phase out small diesel cars from its portfolio as demand is expected to slow down due to upcoming BS-VI emission norms, according to a senior company official.
Tata Motors currently sells its entry-level hatchback Tiago with 1-litre diesel engine, compact sedan Tigor with 1.05-litre powertrain and older models like the Bolt and the Zest with a 1.3-litre diesel engine.
“We feel that low demand for entry-and mid-size diesel models will not justify the high costs involved in developing a new small capacity engine,” Tata Motors President Passenger Vehicles Business Unit Mayank Pareek told PTI.
Pareek said the introduction of BS-VI engines will make the compliance expensive, particularly for small diesel cars.
Moreover, around 80 per cent of the demand in the said segment is for petrol variants, and thus, the additional required investment does not seem viable, he added.
The company’s other products like compact SUV Nexon and recently launched SUV Harrier come with bigger 1.5-litre and 2-litre powertrains respectively and are expected to be upgraded to the next level going ahead.
The company sources the 2-litre diesel engine for Harrier from Fiat.
“Given that these high costs will ultimately have to be passed on to the end customer, the sale of diesel vehicles will logically see a decline in the industry,” he added.
With diesel cars set to become costlier from the next year with the implementation of stricter BS-VI emission norms, major automakers are contemplating about the future of such vehicles in their portfolios.
Already, market leader Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) has stated that it would discontinue diesel models from April 1, 2020, when the BS-VI norms kick in, as it expects the increased cost would put most of the diesel cars, especially the smaller ones, out of reach of small car buyers."

67,2019-05-12,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors is under pressure 
Here are the answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
What is the outlook for Tata Motors?
Sarvesh Goel
Tata Motors (₹186): Since encountering a key long-term resistance at ₹595 in September 2016, the stock of Tata Motors has been on a long-term downtrend, forming lower troughs and lower peaks. Medium-term trend is also down. After recording a multi-year low at ₹141 in February 2019, the stock reversed direction and was on a short-term uptrend until it met a resistance at ₹235 in mid-April.
The stock again began to decline from this resistance. Last week, it plunged 11 per cent, breaking below a key support at ₹200 and the 200-day moving average. The stock appears to have resumed a medium-term downtrend. It hovers well below the 50- and 200-day moving averages.
The stock can extend the downtrend and test support at ₹170 in the short term. A further decline below this base level can drag the stock down to ₹150 over the medium term.
An emphatic fall below the long-term support band between ₹140 and ₹150 will reinforce the primary downtrend and pull the stock down to ₹120 and then to ₹100 in the long run.








 
On the other hand, a strong rally above the immediate resistance at ₹200 can take the stock higher to ₹235 and ₹250 levels. To alter the medium-term downtrend, the stock needs to decisively break above the vital resistance at ₹300. Such a break can strengthen the bullish momentum and take the stock northwards to ₹350 and then to ₹380 over the long term. Investors with a long-term perspective can consider buying above ₹235.
Can I average the stocks of Prakash Industries and Rain Industries at the current prices?
Pradeep Kabra
Prakash Industries (₹71.2):Since recording a multi-year high at ₹276 in January 2018, the stock has been in a long-term downtrend. Medium- and short-term trends are also down. However, the stock currently tests a key long-term support in the range between ₹63 and ₹67. A fall below the base level can drag the stock down to ₹50. But a strong rise above the immediate resistance at ₹80 can take the stock higher to ₹95 and then to ₹100. A breakthrough of ₹100 can push the stock northwards to ₹120 and ₹140 levels in the long term. Consider averaging above ₹80 with a stop-loss at ₹63.
Rain Industries (₹109.8): The long-term trend is down for the stock. But it found support in the band between ₹90 and ₹95 in February 2019. Since then, the stock has been in a sideways range between ₹90 and ₹150. You can average at the current levels with a stop-loss at ₹85.
A strong break above ₹150 will strengthen the bullish momentum and take the stock higher to ₹200 in the long term. The next key resistances are placed at ₹230 and ₹250 levels. Supports below ₹90 are at ₹80 and ₹70.

 Automobile majors, Mahindra and Tata, made their presence felt at Africa’s biggest annual agricultural expo with their new range of products useful for farming and construction.
Hundreds of farmers from across the continent flocked the four-day Nampo Agricultural Trade Show in Bothaville in South Africa (NAMPO) that ended on Friday.
Mahindra and Tata, who have been taking part in the event for some time now, were among the 800 exhibitors that showcased their products during the expo.
Mahindra South Africa’s new range of tractors and farming implements, which were unveiled recently, were on display for the first time at the exhibition.
The company also showcased its full range of products, including generators, PikUps, SUVs and construction equipment.
“With the PikUp now locally manufactured, we are able to develop special edition models that fit our customers’ tastes, while still keeping our affordable prices,” Rajesh Gupta, CEO of Mahindra South Africa, said.
“It is very fitting to launch the S6 Kalahari at NAMPO, as it celebrates our first year of local PikUp production. We have proudly built over 1,500 new PikUp models in Durban since officially opening the plant in May last year,” he added.
 Mahindra has also unveiled a special Farmer’s Kit, which includes cattle rails, a front wrap-around replacement bumper and a rear replacement bumper and a snorkel, all which can be added to the Pik Up vehicles.
The farming community holds a very special place for us. Local farmers supported us when we first launched our vehicle range in 2004 and they remain one of our largest customer groups, he added.
 Boet Erasmus, who owns several farms in Gauteng Free State province, said he would sign up for several of the new tractors and replacement of equipment on his farms.
 I have been a Mahindra fan since I first bought one more than 10 years ago, and the value they deliver has seen me coming back to them repeatedly, Erasmus said.
 Tata Automobile Corporation South Africa (TACSA), which has been exhibiting at NAMPO for the past 11 years, added its Korean Daewoo commercial trucks to the range of models in the display that featured a variety of commercial transport applications, including farming, construction and buses.
The key message we want to deliver this year is that Tata and Daewoo commercial vehicles are cost effective, reliable and easily suited to a huge number of applications and business requirements, said TACSA spokesperson Charl Wilken.
 Thabo Maluleka from North West Province said Tata vehicles are perfect for farming conditions because of their inherent ruggedness, durability and reliability."

Tata Motors, India’s biggest automaker by sales revenue, on Monday posted a 47.4 per cent fall in profit to ₹1,117.48 crore for the fourth quarter ended March, from ₹2,125.24 crore in the year-ago period. 
Muted sales in India and trouble with its Jaguar-Land Rover (JLR) unit continued to impact the company’s performance during the quarter. However, the cost-cutting measures announced earlier in FY19 seem to be working, as the company posted a profit in Q4 against a ₹26,992-crore loss in Q3.  Total revenue from operations in Q4 fell 4.05 per cent to ₹86,422 crore (₹89,929 crore). 
“Our domestic business delivered a resilient performance in the face of challenging market conditions. We have continued to step up our pace of innovation, improved our market shares as well as our profitability. The ‘Turnaround 2.0’ strategy is delivering well, and I am confident that the business is getting the building blocks in place for long-term success,” said N Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Motors.
“At  JLR, we continue to face challenges in China, which we are addressing on priority,” he added. 
The Q4 net profit for JLR was at £119 million  but on a full year basis, the loss was at £3.6 billion.
The company said in a statement that during the year, there was encouraging demand for new models including the Jaguar E-PACE sporty compact SUV, the Range Rover Velar mid-size SUV, the refreshed Range Rover and Range Rover Sport (including plug-in hybrid options) and the all-new electric Jaguar I-PACE. 
“China has been a tough market for us and as far as the overall market itself is concerned, it has now declined almost about 15 per cent...However, the premium cars continue to do well, a growth of about 2-3 per cent growth is what we have seen in the  segment,” said PB Balaji, Tata Motors CFO. “However, we have had a challenging situation because we have taken certain corrective action in terms of moving the strategy from a push to a pull one.”
Mayank Pareek, President, Passenger Vehicle Business Unit, Tata Motors, said that while there has been an overall slowdown in the market, the company has been outperforming the market by four-five times for the past 36 months. The rural sector still shows good growth for the company, he added."

Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc reported its first profit in four quarters, overcoming a continued sales slump in China and raising optimism that Britains largest automaker is finally on the mend.
Net income was £119 million ($151.6 million) in the three months ended March, according to a statement on Monday, while profit before tax, excluding exceptional items, was £269 million. It was an improvement from the record £3.1 billion loss posted at the end of 2018 that shocked investors, a misfortune that spilled over to JLRs Indian parent, Tata Motors Ltd.
While the latest results are encouraging for JLR, its struggles in China persist as sales tumbled 46 per cent in April, raising questions as to how long the Indian parent will hang on to what was once its crown jewel. Tata Group is exploring strategic options for the luxury brand, including a potential stake sale, people familiar with the matter have said.
Though JLR is not the only carmaker suffering in China lately, the market is going through its longest slump in a generation, its not the only challenge its facing. JLR is particularly vulnerable due to the shift away from combustion and diesel engines, and its strong historic links to the UK, have fuelled concern over what a disruptive Brexit could bring.
The US-listed shares of Tata Motors rose 10 per cent in pre-market trading. Jaguars bonds rose on the back if its fourth-quarter results, with its euro-denominated notes with a shorter maturity, gaining the most traction on the news. The bond was bid as low as 75 cents on the euro in February when the company said conditions were not right for it to borrow from the bond market, and was seeking alternative funding.
Since 2018, the company has had its junk credit rating cut three times by S&P Global Ratings and the automaker is eliminating 4,500 jobs."

Shares of Tata Motors  onTuesday tumbled over six per cent in morning trade a day after the company posted 49 per cent decline in March-quarter results.
The scrip, after a weak opening at Rs 186.60, further dropped 6.10 per cent to Rs 178.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
At the National Stock Exchange (NSE), shares plunged 6.36 per cent to Rs 178.05.
On Monday, the company reported 49 per cent decline in March quarter 2019 results at Rs 1,108.66 crore.
The company said the plunge was mainly due to lower revenues and exceptional charge on account of its British arm Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).
During the latest quarter, JLR announced a voluntary redundancy programme and accordingly had an exceptional charge of Rs 1,367.22 crore.
For 2018-19, the company posted a loss of Rs 28,724.20 crore, mainly on the back of impairment charge of Rs 27,837.91 crore recognised in the third quarter of the fiscal. On Monday, Tata Motors Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO), PB Balaji, said market conditions in fourth quarter were adverse due to significant stress on liquidity, higher capacity arising from axle load norm changes and lower economic activity"

India’s leading commercial vehicle maker Tata Motors has introduced Intra, a compact truck, with an objective to grow its sales and marketshare in the pick-up segment dominated by Mahindra and Mahindra and Ashok Leyland.
Tata Intra will be positioned between its largest selling mini-truck Ace and the pick-up Yodha (formerly called Xenon). It will come in two variants – Intra V10 and Intra V20 – priced at ₹5.35 lakh and ₹5.85 lakh, respectively.
While Tata has been a strong player in the sub-one-tonne mini-trucks, it couldn’t grow its position in the pick-up segment (above one tonne payload category) with the higher payload variants of Tata Ace. Mahindra Bolero and Ashok Leyland Dost have been dominating the pick-up market.
“Tata Intra will be a game changer for us in the SCV segment (which comprises mini-trucks and pick-ups) as it offers several industry-first features, setting high standards in the market,” said Guenter Butschek, CEO and Managing Director, Tata Motors.
With Intra’s car-like features, the company hopes to garner more volumes and market share. Intra’s payload capacity is 1.1 tonne and its GVW (gross vehicle weight) is 2.3 tonne.
“There is a growing set of applications in the SCV segment and Intra will meet those specific requirements. We will work towards replicating the Tata Ace success story here,” said Girish Wagh, President – Commercial Vehicle Business Unit, Tata Motors.
While Intra V20 will be powered by a 1396 cc direct injection (DI) diesel engine with 52 KW (70 HP), the V10 will have a 796 cc DI diesel engine delivering 30 KW (40 HP), promising quick acceleration, faster trips and low turnaround time.
It has a standard power steering fitment with a low turning circle radius of 4.75 m, which will ensure easy manoeuvrability.
Tata Ace volumes grew 60 per cent in 2018-19 and the company is bullish on growth prospects in the small truck segment. “We grew our market share in the SCV segment in 2018-19 and our share was 40 per cent in this segment,” said Wagh.
Volumes in the SCV segment stood at 5.15 lakh units in 2018-19 and Tata Motors’ volumes were about 2.06 lakh units. 
The company will also look at launching alternative fuel options such as CNG in Intra."

JLRs mixed fortunes have hit Tata just as it seeks to revamp the sprawling business. File photo




JLRs mixed fortunes have hit Tata just as it seeks to revamp the sprawling business. File photo


 Signs of a turn-around at its marquee Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit may not be enough to ease the challenges facing India’s oldest and most-storied business empire.
The Tata Group bought the British luxury car-maker in 2008 for $2.3 billion, and its lately become a drag on the salt-to-software conglomerate, racking up losses in three quarters through December. 
Although Jaguar posted a net income of 119 million pounds ($151 million) this week, debt at owner Tata Motors Ltd has grown to almost $14 billion, as it struggles to tide over a demand slump in China, the worlds biggest auto market.
JLRs mixed fortunes have hit Tata -- whose wider group debt load bloated to at least $40 billion, the largest among India’s conglomerates -- just as it seeks to revamp the sprawling business. Making matters worse, a steel deal in Europe that would have eased the groups liabilities unravelled this month. Tata Motors and Tata Steel Ltd had a combined debt of about $27 billion, accounting for more than half of the total dues owed by the groups top 18 units. Tata Steel Bsl Ltd and Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd, which are in the process of restructuring, had $9 billion of debt at the end of March 31.
Tata will have to take harsh decisions to mitigate the risk of debt in the long term for the conglomerate, said Arun Kejriwal, a director at KRIS, a Mumbai-based investment advisory firm. For now, Tata Motors and Tata Steel are trouble spots.
The twin developments mark the biggest challenge facing the 151-year-old group that ventured overseas with acquisitions more than a decade ago. Debt has become a defining issue for some of India’s biggest companies as the government cracks down on bad loans following a decade of expansion.
Tata snapped up JLR from Ford Motor Co, and steel-maker Corus Group Plc in 2007 for $12.9 billion in one of the biggest purchases by an Indian company, shedding the groups once-staid image.
After years serving as a cash cow, JLR hit a bump in Europe amid concerns over a disruptive Brexit and the industry’s shift away from fossil-fuel vehicles. The diminishing cash flows have raised questions as to how long Tata will hang on to what was once its crown jewel. The steel business was slammed by the financial crisis in 2008 and a commodity crisis eight years later, prompting the group to look for ways to dispose of the assets.
Tata Motors is not looking to sell its luxury-car unit and expects a turnaround in China in the coming months, the automotive groups Chief Financial Officer (CFO) P.B. Balaji told reporters on May 20. The profit in the fourth quarter came after JLR announced 4,500 job cuts globally and a 2.5 billion-pound savings program. Shares of the parent rose 1.1 per cent Wednesday in Mumbai after tumbling seven per cent in the previous trading session, the most since May 15.
Even in its home market in the United Kingdom (UK), the automaker struggles with the perception of poorly made cars. In the 2018 reliability ranking published by What Car, JLR had four of the five worst performers among the 25 large and luxury SUVs surveyed.
The headwinds faced by JLR will also test the mettle of Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, a 30-year veteran insider brought in two years ago to revamp the $110-billion group and fix faltering units. Patriarch and long-time chairman Ratan Tata hand-picked him to succeed Cyrus Mistry, who was ousted in October 2016 from the top job following a board feud. The goal of the restructuring is to eventually whittle down the 100 operating companies to a more-manageable number under 10 verticals.
The bad news from JLR was compounded by Tata Steel’s decision to give up on a proposed joint venture with German rival, Thyssenkrupp AG, amid antitrust concerns. The deal would have helped transfer some of its debt to the joint venture, allowing the Mumbai-based company to sharpen its focus on ramping up its profitable Indian business. The group is still looking for a partner, possibly outside Europe, an executive said in an interview last week.
As part of his restructuring plan, Chandrasekaran achieved a breakthrough last week. Tata Global Beverages Ltd., which owns brands such as Tetley tea and Eight O’Clock coffee, announced plans to acquire the spice, salt and lentil brands of Tata Chemicals Ltd. The newly-enlarged food company will take on a new name, Tata Consumer Products Ltd, and will have sales of nearly Rs 9100 crore ($1.3 billion).
Tata Sons is simplifying businesses and such moves will unlock Tata Global Beverages’ valuations, said Chakri Lokapriya, chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management in Mumbai.
However, a fix for Tata Steels European business and its 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in debt is still on Chandrasekaran’s to-do list. For JLR, Tata is exploring strategic options, including a potential stake sale.
Recent channel checks in China indicated progress on ground has been slow, with dealers still incurring losses on JLR sales, Jefferies analyst Arya Sen wrote in a note on May 20."

The next few years will be decisive for Tata Motors and the company needs to transform itself to be relevant in the world of future mobility by forming partnerships, developing new solutions and optimising investment, according to its Chairman N Chandrasekaran.
 In his address to shareholders in the company’s Annual Report for 2018-19, he also reiterated that transition to electric mobility needs to be well planned, with the government and the industry working together to ensure the development of an ecosystem. Incentives have to be provided and sustainability goals achieved, he added.
 
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which has been facing challenges the past year, is taking steps to cut costs and is actively looking at partnerships while taking a calibrated approach towards future investment in the product portfolio, he said. 
“The next few years are going to be decisive for our company. We have to focus on operational excellence to deliver positive cashflows while making the right investments to be prepared for the future,” Chandrasekaran said.
 “We need to transform ourselves to be relevant in the world of future mobility. This will require us to form partnerships, develop mobility solutions and optimise our investment in the process.”

The continuing slump in demand for commercial vehicles (CVs) is prompting top players Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland to temporarily shut their factories at Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, to avoid inventory build-up.
“The volume demand in the CV sector has witnessed a drop. Hence, for optimum line utilisation and effective productivity, it has been decided to observe block closure for two days — July 13 and July 22,” said a Tata Motors notification to its employees.
Similarly, Ashok Leyland will close its Pantnagar plant for 12 working days from July 11 to 24, the company said in a staff circular. The Chennai-headquartered firm had closed its factory for about a week in June stating that it was aligning production with sales requirements.
Along with every other vehicle category, the CV segment has also been battling poor demand. Sales slowed in the second half of FY19 due to multiple factors that have continued into the current fiscal as well.
Manufacturing output and consumption are facing a slowdown, and as also the execution of infrastructure projects. New axle-load norms implemented in September 2018 have led to a 15-20 per cent increase in capacity overnight.
Also, fleet operators are postponing purchases given the poor cargo availability and falling freight rates impacting their viability. NBFCs have been facing liquidity constraints and that has affected vehicle financing; they fund more than half the new truck sales.
In June, overall CV sales were down 12 per cent at 70,771 units. Medium and heavy duty trucks reported a 19 per cent decline at 21,512 units. For Q1 of this fiscal, overall CV volumes fell 10 per cent at 2.08 lakh units.
The medium and heavy commercial vehicle segment bore the brunt of sluggish demand with the sales volume plunging 19 per cent at about 64,000 units.
In this segment, Ashok Leyland’s June sales fell 23 per cent at 8,123 units, while Tata Motors’ volumes were down 19 per cent at 9,358 units.
As a consequence, companies are resorting to production cuts and temporary plant shutdowns to align production with demand."

While poor offtakes across key markets such as China and Europe impacted JLR, the slowdown in domestic auto sales did no good to the standalone business. Thus, both the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) business and the domestic standalone business contributed to the loss.
Headwinds at JLR
JLR revenues dropped 2.8 per cent to £5,074 million (₹43,600 crore approx.as of today ) in the April–June 2019 quarter over the same period last year. While it recorded a loss (before taxes and exceptional items ) of £383 million (₹3,300 crore approx. as of today) in this period, it had clocked a loss of £264 million a year ago, in the quarter ended June 2018. 
Poor volumes and regulatory headwinds has been pulling down JLR for at least a year now. During the quarter, JLR’s retail volumes dropped by 11.6 per cent, with volumes in China and Europe falling sharply. Weak demand coupled with run out of older models such as the Discovery Sport contributed to the fall. 
Higher warranty and marketing costs impacted profitability. China has been seeing higher discounts in the premium segment in the last few quarters. 
Thanks to lower operating leverage and higher expenses, JLR’s operating margins came in at 4.2 per cent, the lowest in the last five quarters.
The domestic business too faced tough market conditions due to a slowdown in vehicle demand, liquidity crunch as well as low freight availability. Domestic volumes for the company dropped 22.7 per cent during the quarter.
While JLR numbers have been dismal in the last few quarters, the company expects it to improve from now on. For one, the Chinese market which was bogged down due to the US China trade war is already showing signs of improvement with sales volumes picking up in June 2019. 
In China, the company has also undertaken changes such as resetting inventory levels, redrawing its engagement with retailers and simplifying its incentive programmes to provide greater benefits. 
Secondly, global volumes are expected to recover from launches such as the refreshed Discovery Sport and Jaguar XE as well as the new Range Rover Evoque and the Jaguar I –Pace . Three, the ongoing ‘Project Charge’, directed at achieving cost savings of £2.5 billion by 2019-20 may also improve profitability. It aims to reduce engineering expenses, rationalise inventory and bring down employee and selling expenses. Since 2018-19, JLR has so far achieved £1.7 billion of savings under this project. 
Thanks to these efforts, JLR targets EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes) margins to be in the range of 3-4 per cent this fiscal. It was 2.5 per cent in June 2019 quarter."

Slowing domestic sales, issues related to JLR and softness in the Chinese market have led to Tata Motors posting a consolidated net loss of ₹3,679.66 crore for the first quarter of this fiscal. This is more than double the ₹1,862.57-crore loss posted in the year-ago period.
Total revenue from operations fell 7.84 per cent year-on-year to ₹61,466.99 crore (₹66,701.05 crore).
“The continued slowdown across the auto industry due to weak consumer sentiments, liquidity stress and the impact of axle load norms, particularly in medium/heavy duty, impacted the overall demand. Despite our continuous turnaround effort, we could not prevent some impact on our Q1 performance,” said Guenter Butschek, the company’s MD and CEO.
“Our EBIT margins this quarter were negative, at -2.5 per cent,” said PB Balaji, Group CFO. “The loss of volumes has resulted in a significant negative operating leverage in the business. The places where the volume drops were significant this quarter: One was the year-on-year impact in China. And the second is in India, where we have been talking about the slowdown and the implications of that at our end.”
Tata Motor’s British luxury arm Jaguar Land Rover posted a pre-tax loss of £395 million, and the company expects increased sales from new models and cost savings from the Project Charge initiative to improve results with a profit for the full year, the company said in a regulatory filing.
Balaji said China has now started stabilising for the company (for JLR) and that this has been a quarter where, despite all the challenging conditions, “the cash outflows have been significantly lower than what was at the same period last year.”
“Looking ahead, both our businesses, commercial and passenger vehicles, will leverage Tata Motors’ revived agility and strive to boost consumers’ confidence by various market interventions — from best-in-class product offerings to retail activations and further improved service experience.
“With the Budget announcements and upcoming festival season, we expect some tailwinds for the remaining FY20,” said Butschek."

 Tata Motors has announced a three-day block closure at its Pimpri Chinchwad (Pune) plant.
A Tata Motors spokesperson told BusinessLine: “The external environment remains challenging, leading to demand contraction. We have aligned our production to actual demand and adjusted the number of shifts and contractual manpower.”
Company sources said this was not a complete shutdown, but block closure where some blocks will stop operations for three days while others will continue to operate. The company sources refused to share the number of workers affected because of block closure.
“Our Pune plant produces commercial and passenger vehicles. Only a few blocks are going to be shut while the rest will be operating. This is because of slowdown and managing demand and supply. This is common in OEM companies,” said the company source. 
 The company has communicated to employees that it will shut operations in some blocks from August 8 to August 10 for “maintenance” and also because of “low production”. The company would shoulder 50 per cent cost during the closure while the remaining 50 per cent will be adjusted against the leaves of employees.
Santosh Dalvi, General Secretary, Tata Motors Employees Union, told this paper that the union was “not worried” about the block closure. “This not new to us. It is a part of our contract signed with the company,” he said. However, sources said that earlier block closures were imposed just for maintenance but this closure was forced because of the slump.

34,2019-08-16,Tata Motors,"Problems ‘far more deep-rooted’ in current slowdown: Mayank Pareek


Mayank Pareek
   -  Bijoy Ghosh




Mayank Pareek
   -  Bijoy Ghosh


For someone who has been in the passenger car industry for decades, Mayank Pareek is only too familiar with its cyclical nature.
Yet, the current pace of growth, or more specifically the lack of it, has him a little concerned. “This is not the first time industry is seeing a slowdown but this time around its very characteristic is different for the sheer longevity,” says the President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors.
It was earlier this week when the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers made public its sales data for July and it is evident that nothing has improved. On the contrary, things just seem to be hurtling downhill at a rapid pace. 
And even while this marks the thirteenth consecutive month of “sharp decline” for passenger cars, Pareek says there is more to it than meets the eye. In other words, the news is much worse since the present data does not quite divulge the entire story. 
For one, it is based on how many units manufacturers despatch to dealers when, in reality, the actual picture of customer off-take for passenger cars, translated as the retail portion, began in January 2018 itself. This was when things “started coming down” but it was not apparent since the supply pipeline was being filled constantly.
As Pareek says, one “began noticing this only when the water came over your head” and things have pretty much stayed at this level since then. Yet, it is the disturbing duration of this slowdown which makes it different from previous lows. On previous occasions, they typically lasted three-four months before things came back on track. 
“This time around, the problems are far more deep-rooted. The self-correction that used to happen in the past is not happening now,” says Pareek. Again, in previous cycles, there was one clear reason why a slowdown happened and this would be addressed by the Centre/industry. “However, multiple things are happening this time,” he adds. One of the biggest factors is the liquidity crunch, which is hampering buying. Interestingly, the “signs were apparent” much before the IL&FS crisis became public that there was just not enough money going around. 
Earlier, when customers booked a car, 95 per cent of them would get a loan but this figure has now come down to 74 per cent. And when someone does not get a loan, explains Pareek, they do not apply again since they perceive the rejection as some kind of social stigma.
The fact that the loan space was being squeezed became apparent since January last year when while the passenger car industry continued to feed the dealer pipeline with stocks and the pile-up continued. 
It was only in February 2019 did stakeholders realise that “something was amiss”. The belated awakening was perhaps not entirely their fault since “all of us work on hope by the end of the day”. Traditionally, April and May are bad months for industry and stocks pile up to meet the demand for June. 
Last year, however, saw huge stocks accumulate in June. Clearly, there was a lot of stress within the system but the industry was hopeful of better days ahead. After all, Onam was around the corner in Kerala and hopes were raised for a boom period during this festival season till the floods happened. 
“It was virtually a washout,” recalls Pareek. Despite this setback, manufacturers were reasonably optimistic that things would look up in November and kept on stocking. Their reasoning was that the flood was a one-off thing even while it was getting clear that the danger signs were becoming more visible. 
Earlier, buyers would get a loan with a CIBIL (credit rating history) score of 650 but now even with 750, they would be put through a due diligence where the chances of rejection remained quite high. Naturally, market sentiment turned cautious since customers were not ready to go through this process.
“It has become this way for a while and availability of loans just dried up,” says Pareek. The puzzling part here is that in the car industry, the chances of NPAs building up are low unlike commercial vehicles, which is a B2B space dependent on fleet ownership costs. 
As he explains, a car is bought for personal consumption like a home, which means that the customer plans out in great details for EMIs “and the die is cast”. In Pareek’s view, defaulting on a loan is unlikely with the middle-class buyer “who is extremely careful about his/her social standing” and would not like to be seen as conning the system.
Now with banks becoming overcautious about lending, things have just become a lot worse. The problem is also being accentuated by the fact that maintenance costs for cars are increasing in terms of fuel, insurance, etc. If the proposed notification on higher registration fees comes into effect, it will only lead to the car becoming a “white elephant” for the buyer. 
From Pareek’s point of view, such a situation would be catastrophic since a car is eventually a critical part of the overall economy. After all, production of automobiles creates jobs and also supports other industries such as glass, steel, metal, rubber, components, etc.
Even while the problem of accessing loans persists, the good news is that there is still tremendous desire within the market to own a car. 
“I hope, wish and pray that the liquidity situation improves because things could get difficult otherwise,” says Pareek. 
There will be some buoyancy in the festive season coming up soon thanks to sentiment associated with the occasion but, beyond that, the industry is in dire need of a lifeline. It now remains to be seen how quickly the Centre gets into the picture and does its bit in injecting some kind of stimulus for buying cars.
On the Tata Motors side, Pareek refers to a retail initiative being planned called ‘new paradigm’ where the idea is to sharpen the focus on real retail sales. “The easiest thing is to push vehicles to dealers but this is not right,” he says. On the contrary, the idea now is to increase retail capability with “more feet on the street”. 
Consequently, there have been huge hires happening in the numbers of dealer employees where the bigger task on hand is to change prevalent attitudes that have been around for years. Pareek admits it will be a challenge but this is the best way forward. Plans are also on to reduce stock levels to three-four weeks from September.
The next priority is to increase the number of dealership locations in order to access the customer better. At present, there are nearly 900 car outlets but this is not enough compared to competitors who have over twice as many. 
“The opportunities are out there there in small micro segments where we need to penetrate deep and wide,” says Pareek. It is important to constantly engage with customers and ensure that there are more test drives to keep their interest levels high. “We are actually working on enablers instead of the outcome,” he adds.
The next big launch is the Altroz and the company is hopeful that it will play its role in getting customer connect. Pareek also believes that volumes of other recently launched models like Harrier will pick up in due course. “Brands are built here at Tata Motors and not products. If you push harder than the market’s actual appetite, it will not work,” he says."
33,2019-08-16,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors announces another temporary shutdown; Hero, too, shuts plant for 4 days 
As an unprecedented slowdown continues to rattle the automobile sector, vehicle and components manufacturers have resorted to temporary factory closures to align production with demand. And temporary workers have begun to get pink slips.
What started as a one-off event is now becoming routine. Yet again this week, some companies, including Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and two TVS group firms have announced temporary factory closures.
Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki Chairman RC Bhargava said over 3,000 temporary employees have lost their jobs with the company. Their contracts were not renewed due to the slowdown, he said while asserting that permanent workers have not been impacted.
Hero said its manufacturing plants will be shut for four days from August 15 to 18 to align production with demand. “Production planning is a matter of advance monitoring of the market dynamics and prudent demand forecasting. This helps us to plan our production well in advance, enabling us to stay flexible both in terms of volumes and production schedules,” it said.
While this has been part of the annual holiday calendar on account of an extended weekend with Independence Day and Raksha Bandhan, it also partly reflects the prevailing demand scenario, it added.
Tata Motors appears to have announced its third factory closure of this month. The automaker is shutting its Jamshedpur unit for two days — August 16 and 17.
“The external environment remains challenging, leading to demand correction. We have aligned our production to actual demand and adjusted the number of shifts and contractual manpower,” said a Tata Motors spokesperson.
If OEMs are resorting to such measures, auto parts suppliers cannot be far behind. Chennai-based Sundaram-Clayton Ltd, a TVS group company, has declared August 16 and 17 as non-working days for its Padi plant.
Lucas-TVS, a manufacturer of auto electrical parts, has already announced two non-working days at its Padi unit on the same days in view of the slowdown in the vehicle sector. The company said it is examining the situation for further decisions.
Vehicle sales in India fell 19 per cent in July to 18.3 lakh units on the back of the economic slowdown and weak consumer sentiment. All sectors, including passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles and two-wheelers, reported a double-digit decline in sales.
Auto production also witnessed a decline of about 11 per cent at 10.88 million units in April-July 2019, against growth of about 17 per cent in the same period last year.
Large inventories of 30-45 days with dealers have forced many major manufacturers to cut production, according to analysts at CARE Ratings. With the monsoon wreaking havoc in several States, hopes for a recovery in demand in the coming months, during the festival season, have also diminished."

“System stock reduction through retail focus and aligning production will continue to be our approach, while cautiously monitoring the market in these challenging times,” he said, adding as a result, retail sales are estimated to be ahead of wholesale by over 25 per cent in August.

31,2019-09-01,Tata Motors,"August anguish: Auto sales skid further
 The auto industry seems stuck on the slow lane as the August sales numbers indicate. Impacted by weak consumer sentiment and deferral of purchases, passenger vehicle sales fell during August on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. Severe floods across States also hurt demand, companies said, adding that they are expecting better sales from the festival season.
Market leader Maruti Suzuki India has reported a 36 per cent YoY decline in sales during August to 93,173 units (1,45,895 units). 
The company, which is a market leader in the compact segment, saw the numbers falling to 54,274 units last month compared with 71,364 units in the corresponding month of 2018.
Hyundai Motor India has also reported a double-digit YoY decline in sales (17 per cent) to 38,205 units (45,801 units in the same month last year).
Honda Cars India and Tata Motors, in particular, have reported the most dismal numbers, selling less than half of the units they sold last year in August. 
However, the companies are expecting an improved show during the upcoming festival season.
“Under the challenging market situation, we continued to focus on improving retail sales. Our retail sales were 42 per cent more than offtake, and as a result, the network stock came down by over 3,000 vehicles. 
“This prepares dealers well for the festival season. Our aim is to improve the retail capability,” Mayank Pareek, President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors, said.
 








 
He said marking the onset of the festival season, the company will drive positive sentiments with special offers and several special editions. 
Toyota Kirloskar Motor, which also reported a 24 per cent YoY decline in sales during August (10,701 vs 14,100), said that with the recent announcement of sops by the government, the demand may pick up from the current month.
“The measures announced by the Finance Minister recently to boost the auto sector including cheaper car loans, improving liquidity through credit expansion of public sector banks, deferring the one-time registration fees, higher depreciation for all vehicles and lifting the ban on purchase of new vehicles in government departments are likely to spur some demand. The latest FDI reforms, which will boost local manufacturing, also come as a positive move to propel growth in the industry in the long run,” N Raja, Deputy Managing Director, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, said.
In the commercial vehicle segment too, companies including Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors have reported a decline in sales."

Speaking at the annual convention of Society of Indian automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), Butschek, however, said he was cautiously optimistic about a recovery from the current situation on the back of measures announced by the government.
“Let’s actually take it in a very dramatic way and let’s conclude, the Indian Automotive Growth story is about to collapse,” he said. Later on clarifying his statement on the sidelines, he said, “I have seen the statistics published by the entire automotive industry in the first quarter, then the continuing statistics provided on wholesale in the month of July, August. I didn’t say it has collapsed, it’s about to”.

Low economic activity leading to subdued demand, triggered by the liquidity crisis and the increase of the axle load regulations for commercial vehicles and uncertainty in the minds of consumers have severely hurt the sector, he added. Stating that automobile manufacturers are taking steps to overcome the challenge by adjusting production to demand, Butschek said, “Block closure has become the word of the year“.
Welcoming the recent steps taken by the government, Butschek hoped for things to turn around, although the road ahead is still challenging. “I am cautiously optimistic that the worst is behind us,” he said, however, added that there were lot of uncertainties related to BS-VI emission norms transition and how it could impact overall demand.
He said the recent slew of measures announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will help the auto industry. Yet, he said, “in order to get out of the current crisis and not miss the festive season, we require clarity from the government, here and now, on GST and scrappage policy”."

There is no confusion, and no reason for confusion regarding internal combustion engines and electric vehicles, as ICE and EV will coexist at least for another decade or even beyond, said Guenter Butchsek, CEO & MD, Tata Motors Ltd. Tata Motors is working on multiple products with the intention of making EVs mainstream and aspirational, he said.
He added that he personally doesn’t know “why it is so difficult to give the message that ICE and EV are not each other’s enemies” and that it can peacefully coexist for at least another decade, and that this message has not come across clearly yet. “We need to make people understand that this is not a conflict as far as mobility is concerned. It is just two different sides of the same coin,” he reiterated.
“We don’t shy away from the need that the faster adaptation of the electric is a question of the ecosystem and it requires the private sectors’ commitment to build this ecosystem and this is what we are doing as a venture, as a player: connecting aspirations,” said Butchsek.
 Tata Motors intends to offer a comprehensive range of EVs and other ecosystem solutions using Tata Motors’ in-house capabilities, coupled with Tata Group companies’ expertise and ongoing collaboration with other ecosystem players, said Butchsek. These products would be globally contemporary and set a high standard for electric vehicles in India, he added.
“Electrification is a much larger play and it goes beyond automotive. Sometimes, I actually feel it is the smallest part, when it comes to it, because it requires the development and set-up of a comprehensive ecosystem, and this is the larger playing.” he said, adding that in order to have a cost attractive electric proposition, a higher local content is needed. Localisation of components will have a positive cost impact, he said.
With the recent FAME 2 incentives and GST reductions, electric vehicles have become more affordable and are poised to achieve mainstream adoption, he said.
Apart from the confusion regarding the question of ICE and EV, he pointed out that there is also the question of the continuance of diesel vehicles post the transition to the BS-6 emission norms, set to be enforced from April 1, 2020 onwards. Taking into consideration the high acquisition cost of lower displacement diesel vehicles (below 1.5 litres), its share will possibly be reduced, he said. 
He also said that a reduction in the GST rates, which the industry has long been demanding, will surely have a positive effect, drawing a parallel to how it helped back in 2008, when the industry was privy to a slowdown."

 In a bid to speed up adoption of electrical vehicles, Tata Motors on Thursday unveiled a new technology platform aimed at finding solutions to concerns such as range, power, durability, safety and charging infrastructure. 
Called ‘ZIPTRON’, this soon-to-be-introduced EV powertrain technology will power a range of Tata electric cars, starting with a new launch in Q4 of FY20. The ZIPTRON technology will primarily serve the personal segment. Currently, Tata Motors does not cater to the personal segment as far as EVs are concerned. 
“With this technology, we hope to usher in a new wave of eMobility in India and accelerate faster adoption of EVs, supporting the government’s vision,” said Guenter Butschek, CEO & MD, Tata Motors. 
Every vehicle made using the ZIPTRON technology will at least have a range of 250 km, said Shailesh Chandra, President - Electric Mobility Business & Corporate Strategy, in order to address the issue of range anxiety that EVs are otherwise saddled with. The battery, which accounts for the “single biggest cost of an EV”, will have a warranty of eight years, along with the motor, he said. Vehicles developed on this platform will also be capable of fast charging. To address the safety concerns surrounding EVs, these vehicles will conform to the IP67 standard — “the highest standards as far as waterproofing and dusting is concerned”, he said. 
“This is how we intend to break the barriers that exist today and make EVs desirable for indian consumers and make it a mainstream choice,” said Chandra. 3.3 million passenger vehicles were sold in the country in 2018, said Chandra, on account of an increase in personal disposable income and low penetration, but, out of this, only 2,027 vehicles sold were EVs. “This means that we are at very early stages of the evolution of electric vehicles,” he said.
The reasons he identified for the low share of EVs in the overall number of PVs are concerns over its range, power, durability, safety and charging infrastructure. Customers are accustomed to the range that conventional vehicles offer, and the consequent range anxiety that emanates from this becomes a constraint. 
As for power, the kind of EVs that Indian consumers have been exposed to as of now are known to be sluggish with low performance, said Chandra. The battery, which accounts for the single biggest cost for an EV, and concerns over its durability, as well as the safety of EVs during extreme weather conditions are some of the other reasons, he said. The time taken for charging as well as the dearth of charging infrastructure are other factors, said Chandra.
ZIPTRON has been designed in-house, while also utilising the company’s global engineering network, and this technology has also been tested across 1 million kilometers. ZIPTRON also utilises smart regenerative braking to charge the battery while on the drive. 
Talking about the business case for developing EVs, Chandra said: “From our perspective, when you are talking about investment in EVs, I am not going to develop immediately till you cross a certain level of demand development in the country into a dedicated platform — till it does not give immense sense to a consumer, or it gives enough benefits to the consumers...There’s a clear piggybacking strategy on investments which are already made. These are small incremental investments, but delivering a value proposition for the customer, as far as this is concerned,” adding that it is a robust business case for EVs the company has.
Chandra said that the fleet segment only constitutes 10 per cent of the total industry, whereas 90 per cent of the industry caters to the personal segment. “Electrification in the country cannot be driven by not addressing the 90 per cent...Whatever personal segment (EV) options were there in the market, they did not address the barriers. Therefore, this 90 per cent needs to be addressed with the right attributes and we really see a market for it going forward. 
“The second reason is that if you just focus on fleet, there is a danger that the personal segment would start associating an electric car with taxi and that would be very bad for electrification, for the country...It is possible to make (personal) electric vehicles very attractive. And that is our intention when we launch the first product (in Q4 of this year),” said Chandra."

24,2019-10-04,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors shifts track with retail as its new mantra 
Guenter Butschek still remembers how the system of reporting wholesale vehicle sales numbers was a bit of a novelty to him when he moved to India four years ago.
“If there is something I found strange from my international experience, when I first came to India, was the wholesale reporting as I am not used to it,” admits the CEO & Managing Director of Tata Motors. 
From his point of view, wholesale has nothing to do with the market situation or even a true reflection of it. “On the contrary, it camouflages market reality and you do not realise that there could be a problem (someday),” adds Butschek.
His worst fears have come true now with the prolonged slowdown in the auto industry except that the Tata Motors chief will still have reasons to feel pleased. Over the last few months, the company has been focussing on retail as part of an endeavour to be transparent and supportive of its extended ecosystem of suppliers and dealers.
According to Butschek, he had been “chasing my guys to report retail” which they said could only be provided by the dealers. “My point was that I would still appreciate it since this would mark a beginning and we would become more credible in the process,” he says. 
After all, publishing official retail figures is pretty much the norm overseas quite unlike India where it is about how many units can be pushed “into the courtyard of the dealer”. It is Butschek’s view that what finally counts is “what has been given to the customer and literally operated in the market”. There are just no two ways about it, he insists. 
Has this been one of the contributory factors for the present slowdown where surplus stocks have choked the pipeline? After all, nearly 300 dealerships have closed down over the last couple of years and the liquidity crunch has done little to alleviate the situation.
Butschek agrees that there is problem for sure though he does not quite subscribe to any reference to ‘crisis’ since it “is an extremely powerful word which comes with a host of negative associations”. The truth, however, is that demand has fallen and the slowdown has been longer lasting than any similar situation in the past with “nobody expecting it to last this long”.
The required adjustment by the industry has come a little too late too, says the Tata Motors chief. The fact that the business is generally reported as wholesale with the accompanying market rankings as a result have only ended up skewing the script. “This works well so long as the market is very strong and the stocks will eventually be in customers’ hands quickly without too much of a gap. Now imagine if the same demand situation is declining. When do you actually start adjusting your wholesale and change your push principle to a pull principle?” asks Butschek. 
This was precisely when Tata Motors changed tracks and opted for retail as the better alternative to wholesale reporting. Its MD recalls how the decline in Q2 (July-Sept) last year had caused stocks to pile up across industry. This was when the banking crisis and NBFC volatility happened even while companies were hopeful that demand would pick up.
“We thought the crisis would not impact the industry and were confident about the festive season,” continues Butschek. That boom did not happen and Tata Motors went in for a block closure at its Sanand plant in November even though it did not make too much noise about it. After all, there was no point being perceived as cautious and pessimistic. 
December 218 saw a slight recovery and prompted automakers to replenish stock levels since Q4 (Jan-March) is traditionally strong. This, however, did not turn out to be the case even though March was better with a slight recovery and “we thought the worst was behind us”.
The beginning of the new fiscal (April-June) is traditionally not so strong but still ended up being way below industry expectations. This was also the time when Tata Motors announced in the beginning of April at its dealer conference in Dubai that the time had come to shift focus from wholesale to retail. 
Butschek was absolutely categorical that it was impossible to continue with pushing and it was time to move to pulling while keeping dealers in the loop constantly on replenishing stocks. “Obviously, if the vehicle does not stay too long with dealers and keeps moving to customers, it is fine but in a decline we need to make sure that this line of command does not break,” explains the Tata Motors MD. 
It is a no-brainer that demand does not start with production but with retail. Hence, pumping vehicles into the network in order “to keep the metal going” was not going to help anyone’s cause. The better option was to unleash the cash by moving to retail while talking to dealers on volume expectations.
“It is an educated discussion quite unlike the past when stocks were pushed incessantly. Now it is a huge change in mindset from our side where we talk of dealer volume expectations and so on. We understand the demand structure and plan for the future,” says Butschek.
He concedes that the downturn accelerated the thought process and today the Tata Motors team is in line with the new mantra of retail being the way forward. It assures more transparency and the company believes that it makes sense to “play with an open card”. 
The bigger challenge though is to have all stakeholders come onboard which means other vehicle manufacturers should also be ready to embrace this idea. Apparently, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has been apprised by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) given that there is a huge gap between the sales reports put out by each of them. “We must move to retail since this is a truthful reflection of on-ground reality. Beyond the change in statistics, this will be a huge transition in credible information,” says Butschek. For this to happen, FADA, SIAM and ACMA (Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India) should be on the same page eventually.
“To take the bull by the horns, we at Tata Motors had to shift to retail from wholesale,” he adds. Even if the company was the first to do so, the real change will happen when others also follow suit. “We are definitely positive and the purpose of this switch will only guide us better,” says Butschek. 
It is also his firm view that everyone within the ecosystem will have to help each other in order to bring sanity and credibility all around. According to him, suppliers will also gain immensely from the viewpoint of planning better instead of coping with drastic order reductions overnight.
“Wholesale is the wrong mechanism and you cannot choke the dealer with stocks,” he says while pointing out that it is important to continue with retail even when the recovery happens. “It is about mirroring the ground reality of the market and the earlier this happens the better it is for all of us,” says Butschek."

Tata Motors decided to position its brand Harrier, as #AboveAll
   -  PAUL NORONHA


It was a little over a fortnight ago when Tata Motors tuned into ‘The International Day of Sign Language’ on September 23.
The idea was to spread awareness about the adoption of sign language as a means of communication and encourage equality. The company decided to vocalise its call to action for its brand Harrier, positioned as #AboveAll.
The campaign has a video showcasing the story of a family that hires a deaf-mute housekeeper and how the couple positively encourages her by stepping up to learn the sign-language along with her to communicate.
Launched in association with digital agency WATConsult, the digital and social media agency from Dentsu Aegis Network, #LanguageOfHumanity aims to create awareness on the importance of considering sign language and stimulate the feeling of inclusivity.
Rajiv Dingra, Founder and CEO, WATConsult, says Tata Motors has always had a progressive approach towards the growth of society at large. “On International Day of Sign Language, the brand wanted to inculcate the #LanguageOfHumanity. The video subtly aims to spread the word and takes ahead the brand’s philosophy of positioning its flagship product, Harrier, #AboveAll in its true sense,” he adds.
According to Vivek Srivatsa, Head of Marketing, Passenger Vehicle Business Unit, Tata Motors, since the Harrier is positioned as an SUV that is #AboveAll, the team decided to use the hashtag and embed it in the brand’s storyline, “pushing the message that the power in the language of humanity is truly #AboveAll.”
Ever since the launch of Tiago, the company has been reinventing its marketing strategies and driving engagement for its brands. “Cars are a high-value, discretionary spend for consumers rather than an impulse purchase. Engagement helps them experience the product capabilities and inspires confidence before purchase,” says Srivatsa.
This was initiated with Tiago when Tata Motors introduced its new design theme and wanted to communicate the evolving brand identity to consumers as well as the “future of our cars and SUVs”. The company teamed up with a popular online content creator a few months into the launch and created a form of finite branded content in ‘Tripling with Tiago’.
‘Tripling’ was released on TVF in 2016 and featured three siblings who are forced to take a road trip together in the Tiago, shown as an essential character in the web series as opposed to just another product placement.
Tata Motors then pushed the envelope further with the Hexa, Nexon and Harrier. In the case of Harrier, soon after its launch, the company created an environment in showrooms to appeal to all the five senses while helping consumers build a sensory relation with the vehicle.
For instance, chocolates, specifically associated with Harrier, could be tasted, while a special fragrance for the cabin smell wafted around where consumers could also listen in to a curated audio playlist and literally breathe in the experience.
According to Srivatsa, though traditional print ads and TVCs (television commercials) do their bit in building the customer’s intent to buy a car, “experiential and engagement marketing initiatives have enabled us to build credibility and positive word of mouth for our products.”
Engaging with consumers at all levels has got the company rolling out other engagement marketing tools. The Tata Motors Experience Centre (TMEC), Hexa Experience Centre (HEC) and Nexon Skill Arena (NSA), have all played a pivotal role in strengthening the brand connect with consumers.
The HEC, simulated an outdoor environment, bringing out the true capabilities of the car. For the NSA, conducted across 10 cities, the team designed a first-hand experience of the Nexon’s power, versatility and other capabilities."

At a time when the global automotive industry is facing considerable headwinds with sales slowing or sliding down in most of the major car markets of the world, it takes a lot of foresight and some daring to pump in fresh funds into creating a new design and engineering centre. That’s what Jaguar Land Rover has done at Gaydon in the UK, where its future cars will be conceived. Jaguar’s next generation XJ and Defender which will be launched next year may not benefit from the swanky new facilities. But, many of the next range of cars will be electrics or hybrids and will be designed, prototyped and developed at the vast new site.
The Gaydon site forms part of Jaguar Land Rover’s Destination Zero mission; JLR claims it to be an ambition to make societies safer and healthier, and the environment cleaner. The company’s focus is on achieving a future of zero emissions, zero accidents and zero congestion – across its facilities, and through its products and services. The site is home to almost 13,000 highly-skilled engineers and designers who are developing the current and next generation Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles.
We in India will also witness the launch of future electrics coming from JLR, including the I-PACE electric crossover and a range of new hybrids from Land Rover. Globally, JLR wants to offer electric options for every model by next year. Speaking at the official inauguration event late last month, Ralf Speth, CEO of JLR, said, “Megatrends like urbanisation and sustainability are fundamentally changing the automotive industry. At JLR, we not only participate, but want to shape future mobility. Our vision is for a world in which zero emission vehicles, public transport and self-driving pods will form one smart integrated and networked transport system.”
To meet the new ‘Destination Zero’ targets, the product creation centre brings design, engineering and production purchasing under one roof for the first time in JLR’s history. The site is 4 million m² big, equivalent to almost 480 football pitches. It delivers more than 50,000 m² of additional workspace which has been designed to encourage collaboration throughout the entire vehicle development process – from sketch to showroom. It includes the new Jaguar design studio, co-locating Jaguar and Land Rover design for the first time. JLR says that the new offices are rated in the top 10 per cent of most sustainable non-domestic buildings in the UK. Up to 20 per cent of its energy will come from almost 3 000m² of photovoltaic solar panels on the roof, and the remainder from 100 per cent renewable sources.
Jaguar Design is made up of designers from across the globe and from a range of industry backgrounds, including fashion, watch-making, sports and gaming. The design processes utilise industry-leading technology, including custom-made clay modelling machines allowing 20 models to be worked on at once, virtual reality (VR) systems and an 11-m K digital display wall known as ‘The Electric’. The floor area of the new Jaguar Design Studio measures over 12,000m2 – an increase of around 33 per cent compared to previous spaces in Whitley.
The main studios are named Studio 3 and Studio 4, taking inspiration from the numbers of the Le Mans-winning Jaguar D-types of 1957 and 1956 respectively, as well as paying homage to studios 1 and 2 at Whitley, which was the home of Jaguar Design from 1985. The naming approach is continued in the meeting rooms, with half named after iconic Jaguar models and the other half taking their names from important people in Jaguar history, including founder Sir William Lyons, designer Geoff Lawson and the actor Steve McQueen.
Studios 3 and 4 house a total of 10 clay modelling plates, each measuring 20-m long and capable of accommodating two clays, with a load capacity of 4.5-tonnes. For the first time, designers can now place interior and exterior models next to one another to improve synergy and collaboration between the two disciplines. Each plate is fitted with floor-integrated machine rails to allow double-sided processing of models by the 3+2-axis Kolb Concept Line CNC clay milling machines. The advanced system can switch between measuring and milling. The plates also feature floor-integrated lifts for the clay models. These are capable of providing continuous height adjustment, to enable the most ergonomic working positions for Jaguar modellers.
The studios are fully temperature controlled to ensure clay remains in the ideal state to be worked on by the 46-strong team of sculptors, while lighting is provided at exactly the right brightness and colour temperature. Models can easily be taken outside to be viewed in natural light and from a range of distances and angles. In total, the new Jaguar Design Studio has 906m2 of glazing, including three full-length skylights which flood the studio with natural light.
VR plays an increasingly important role in Jaguar Design with digitalisation teams appearing at every stage of the process from sketching through to launch animations. A VR rig enables designers and studio engineers to test ideas in the virtual world much faster and more efficiently than before. From the early conceptual stage, the Computer-Aided Surfacing team convert the design sketches into digital 3D models while the in-house Design Visualisation and Animation team works closely with designers and data teams to render and animate the sketches and 3D models.
The new Jaguar Design Studio will place greater importance on advanced material technologies, too. Focussed on sustainability, JLR says that the colour and materials team have more space and technology to investigate and test new resources that continue to demonstrate luxury and tactility for the next generation of vehicles."

18,2019-10-20,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors range-bound with positive bias 
Here are the answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
I wish to buy the stock of Tata Motors at current levels. What are its prospects?
Shanmukh Swamy
Tata Motors (₹136.7): The stock of Tata Motors is in a downtrend across long- and medium-term time- frames. But in the short term, the stock has been in a sideways consolidation phase in the wide band between ₹110 and ₹140 since mid-August.
Within this range, the stock took base at ₹112 last week and started to trend upwards. The breaching of the key moving average has strengthened the bullish momentum. There has been an increase in daily volume over the past two months.
Witnessing buying interest, the stock jumped 12.7 per cent last week accompanied by good volume. There has been an increase in weekly volume over the past two months. The stock trades well above its 21- and 50-day moving averages.
The daily relative strength index (RSI) has entered the bullish zone from the neutral region. Moreover, the weekly RSI has entered the neutral region from the bearish zone. Other indicators in the daily chart are also charting upwards. The stock now tests a key resistance in the band between ₹140 and ₹150. An emphatic break-out of this barrier will pave way for an up move to ₹170 and then to ₹200 in the medium term. Key resistances beyond ₹200 are at ₹220 and ₹240 levels.
You can consider buying the stock in declines with a long-term stop-loss at ₹110. On the other hand, if the stock fails to move beyond ₹150, it could remain range-bound between ₹110 and ₹150 for a while. Immediate supports are at ₹125 and ₹115. But a plunge below ₹110 can drag the stock to a new multi-year low. The stock has significant long-term resistances beyond ₹240 at ₹300 and ₹350.
What are the prospects of Karur Vysya Bank at the current price, for the next one to two years?
M Kannappan
Karur Vysya Bank (₹56.4): The stock is in a downtrend across all time-frames — long, medium and short term. Since early August, the stock has been in a sideways consolidation phase in the band between ₹54 and ₹64, with a downward bias.
 








 
However, the indicators and oscillators in the daily as well as the weekly charts show signs of positive bias. Therefore, only a break-out of this range on either side will depict the next leg of move for the stock.
Traders/investors should avoid taking fresh positions at this juncture. A fall below ₹54 can pull the stock down to ₹50 and then to ₹45 in the medium term.
On the upside, a strong rally beyond ₹64 can take the stock higher to ₹70 and then to ₹80. Investor with an appetite for low risk appetite can buy above ₹70 levels.

Tata Motors consolidated net loss narrowed to ₹216 crore during the second quarter of the current fiscal year, from the year-ago period’s net loss of ₹1,048 crore. 
The company’s total revenue from operations was ₹65,431.95 crore (₹71,981.08 crore), down 9.09 per cent.
The Board of Directors of TML approved a preferential allotment of ordinary shares and warrants to the promoter, Tata Sons, for an aggregate consideration of around ₹6,500 crore subject to shareholder approval, the company said. 
While Jaguar Land Rover’s performance improved, the market slowdown impacted India business. 
The benefits from the recovery in China and Project Charge, the restructuring programme that began earlier this fiscal, has been offset by decline in the M&HCV (medium and heavy commercial vehicle) and the stock reduction in India, it added.
 “The industry has been grappling with a long and sharp slowdown. Growth continues to be impacted by subdued demand, higher capacity from the new axle load norms, liquidity stress, low freight availability, weak consumer sentiment and general economic slowdown. The sharp market decline over the last few months has impacted our Q2 performance as well which is disappointing,” said Guenter Butschek, CEO and MD, Tata Motors. 
The performance in this quarter has been fundamentally highlighted by the turnaround in JLR and the performance delivering a significant improvement from what it was before, said PB Balaji, Group CFO, Tata Motors Ltd, while adding that at the same time, the company was privy to a sharp market decline in India.
Jaguar Land Rover improved its performance this quarter and delivered a well-rounded performance, the company said. “In particular, the improvement in China on the back of better operational metrics is reassuring. Project Charge is well ahead of plans and has delivered £2.28 so far. The product offensive continued with the launch of the New Defender which has received an excellent response,” it said.
For the financial year ending 31 March 2020, Jaguar Land Rover continues to expect year-on-year improvement and to target a 3-4 per cent EBIT margin with cash flow increased over last year, it added.
Butschek said with the onset of festival season, it is seeing initial green shoots this month with better retail sales in passenger vehicles."
15,2019-10-25,Tata Motors,"JLR drives Tata Motors home
Tata Motors has recorded losses at the consolidated level in five of the last six quarters. But two things stand out in the three months ended September 2019.
One, the losses have narrowed substantially to just ₹217 crore, compared with ₹1,049 crore a year ago. And, two, Jaguar Land Rover ( JLR) has returned to profitability.
The downturn in domestic auto sales did no good to the standalone business, which posted a loss of ₹1,282 crore. But what helped is the sharp improvement in performance at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) thanks to a recovery in China and other cost control efforts. Jaguar Land Rover posted a profit (before tax and exceptional items) of £156 million (approximately ₹1,420 crore) during the quarter.
JLR’s topline grew 8 per cent year-on-year to £6,086 million (₹55,400 crore), thanks to launches/facelifts and better offtake in China. JLR’s China retail volumes jumped 24.3 per cent even as the industry sales dropped 6 per cent. Steps taken by the company in the last few months, such as resetting inventory levels, redrawing its engagement with retailers and simplifying its incentive programmes to provide greater benefits have paid off. JLR was also helped by benign material costs, lower depreciation and fixed marketing expenses as well as favourable foreign exchange rates.

 Tata Group, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), has approached carmakers including China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. and BMW AG as it seeks partnerships for the beleaguered British automotive business, people with knowledge of the matter said.
India’s largest conglomerate has said it’s open to finding partners for JLR to save on costs and share the burden of investing in electric vehicles.
The deliberations were at an early stage and Tata could still approach other potential partners, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. It wasn’t immediately clear how receptive Geely and BMW were. “There have been no talks with Tata or JLR,” Geely said in a statement. BMW declined to comment, as did Tata.

Any tie-up with a Chinese automaker could potentially help JLR in that market, where its struggles led to a $3.9 billion writedown earlier this year. Deeper ties between the British luxury brand and BMW would build on an existing collaboration to develop engines and electric-drive technology, though the German carmaker’s former chief executive officer in August ruled out any equity investment.
Scale has become increasingly crucial in the automotive industry as carmakers pool resources to tackle electrification and autonomous driving. The challenge is especially daunting for smaller players such as JLR, which has committed to an ambitious program to offer electric variants for each of its new models from 2020. The British carmaker was an early mover among incumbent manufacturers with the electric I-Pace crossover, introduced last year."

Tata Motors' rating outlook is negative, says Moody's
   -  Bloomberg


Tata Motors’ (TML) operations excluding JLR, in particular, commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles in India, face acute challenges, with sluggish economic growth, weak liquidity, tight financing norms, and low rural income negatively affecting consumer sentiment, Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday, even as it added that the preferential allotment of equity shares and convertible warrants to Tata Sons for a $914 million equity injection is credit positive.
""We view the preferential allotment as credit positive because TML plans to apply the proceeds towards reducing its debt,"" said Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody's Vice-President and Senior Credit Officer, who is also Moody's Lead Analyst for TML. ""The equity injection also reflects Tata Sons' continued support, and will somewhat reduce the pressure on TML's balance sheet, stemming from the weak operating performance of its India business, even as JLR delivers some improvement.""
TML's PV sales volumes declined by 41 per cent in the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2020, while commercial vehicle volumes declined by 29.5 per cent over the same period.
Moody's Investors Service has also assigned a Ba3 rating to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by Tata Motors Ltd (TML, Ba3 negative). The rating outlook is negative, Moody’s said in a statement.
“The proposed notes rank pari passu with TML's existing senior unsecured notes and are, therefore, rated at the same level as these notes and TML's Ba3 corporate family rating (CFR),” it said.
""The Ba3 ratings reflect TML's (1) leading market position in commercial vehicles (CVs) in India; (2) 100 per cent ownership of the premium/ luxury car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc (JLR, B1 negative); and (3) ownership by Tata Sons, which results in a one-notch uplift, reflecting our expectation of continued parental support, when needed,"" said Chaubal.
On 25 October, TML had announced that it will make a preferential allotment of equity shares and convertible warrants to Tata Sons for a $914 million equity injection, of which $548 million will be paid immediately, and the balance over a period of 18 months.
JLR continues to make progress on its cost savings and efficiency plan with the aim to achieve GBP 1.0 billion in cost savings by March 2020, having delivered GBP 0.5 billion up to September 2019, Moody’s said. In addition, JLR has also achieved GBP1.5 billion of its GBP1.7-billion target on capital expenditure and working capital improvements as of September 2019. Looking ahead, Moody's expects JLR's adjusted debt/EBITDA to improve from 10.6x at March 2019 to 6.0x over the next 12 months, it added.
Although TML will likely deliver slightly better volumes in H2 fiscal 2020 as festive demand picks up, Moody's remains sceptical about the long-term impact of short-term government stimulus measures for the auto industry, it said.
In particular, low capacity utilisation levels for PVs, the segment's low profitability (reported EBITDA margin of 0.1 per cent in fiscal 2019 and an EBITDA loss of 21.4 per cent in H1 fiscal 2020), pose a severe drag and key rating concern, it added.
Moody's expects a reversal in working capital in H2 fiscal 2020 and the equity injection from Tata Sons to be applied towards debt reduction, causing leverage to stay in the 5.7x-6.2x range over the next 12 months.
The negative outlook primarily reflects the challenges faced by TML's operations, excluding JLR, from the Indian auto sector's slowing sales due to weak demand, over-capacity and tightening liquidity, it said.
“The negative outlook also reflects the negative outlook on JLR and the execution risks related to a sustained turnaround in JLR's financial performance amid a subdued operating environment, uncertainty around Brexit, and the possibility of US tariffs,” it said.
On what could change the rating, Moody’s said that TML's ratings could be downgraded if JLR's ratings are downgraded; or the performance of its businesses -- excluding JLR -- remain weak amid subdued market conditions, input cost pressures, disappointing new product sales, or a decline in market share, in turn, resulting in weakening earnings and cash flow.
Specific metrics that Moody's would consider for a downgrade include leverage rising above 6.0x and EBITA margins falling below 2 per cent, both on a sustained basis.
Any change to Moody's assumption of support from Tata Sons could also prompt a revision to the one-notch uplift incorporated in TML's ratings, it said.
On the other hand, Moody's said the rating outlook could return to stable if the outlook on JLR's B1 ratings returns to stable; and TML's Indian operations, that have been under pressure for the last two-three quarters, improve significantly; both resulting in an improved trajectory of TML's credit metrics."

8,2019-12-04,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors to hike passenger vehicle prices from January 2020
Tata Motors on Wednesday said it will increase the prices of its passenger vehicles from January 2020, primarily in order to offset the impact of upgrading its portfolio to conform to BS-VI emission norms.
The company currently sells products ranging from hatchback Tiago to SUV Harrier, priced between Rs 4.39 lakh and Rs 16.85 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
“With BS-VI products coming in, prices will increase from January,” Tata Motors President (Passenger Vehicles Business Unit) Mayank Pareek told PTI in an interview here. He declined to quantify the increase in prices, but said the hike next month would be on a higher side as compared to earlier price revisions taken by the company.
“We are working on the calculations...normally if any change happens the prices go up by Rs 10,000-15,000. Now there are two things happening, one is BSVI and there is also pressure from rise in commodity prices,” Pareek said.
BS-VI emission norms in India are slated to kick in from April 1, 2020.
On Tuesday, Maruti Suzuki India announced to increase prices of its models from January to offset rising input costs. Other automakers like Toyota, Mahindra & Mahindra and Mercedes-Benz are also contemplating a similar move.
Hyundai Motor India and Honda Cars India, however, said they will not increase vehicle prices in January, but their products will see price hike when BSVI compliant models are introduced in the market."
7,2019-12-06,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors all charged up with Nexon EV
With barely 10 days to go before the Nexon EV is unveiled, Shailesh Chandra has reasons to be excited. 
“It is going to create a new segment and we have already announced a price bracket of ₹15-17 lakh,” says Chandra, President, Electric Mobility Business & Corporate Strategy, Tata Motors. 
From his point of view, this is a competitive price tag considering that personal segment cars in this range are dearer. Things would be even better for Nexon EV, he adds, if it qualifies for the Centre’s FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicle) 2 scheme which clearly seeks a less than ₹15 lakh (ex-works) price. 
As he explains, the company had targeted this price and has “gone though whatever FAME 2 has directed” it to do including localisation, which is aligned to the phased manufacturing plan. This despite the fact that it is a private segment offering which may not be part of FAME 2.
“Yet, we thought advocacy for the private segment should be a given — that here is someone who has hit the ₹15 lakh price point and meets the localisation norms. If it is not consumed in the fleet segment, why not open it up?” asks Chandra.
Additionally, the fact remains that 90 per cent of car purchases in India are typically done under ₹15 lakh, “which is the appetite of the market”. Hence, he continues, this is the only way a product will be part of the mainstream which, in any case, is the objective of FAME 2. 
Tata Motors is hoping that the Nexon EV creates a huge splash in the private/personal space which takes up a lion’s share of the market. Right now, the penetration of electric vehicles “is not so great”, which is understandable given that it is the fleet segment which has the support of FAME 2. “The propensity to buy in the fleet is higher because of operating costs and total cost of ownership,” says Chandra. It makes sense to this extent, which justifies the Centre’s focus on sops to the fleet segment.
“Yet, private is equally attractive given that 10 per cent of a three million market is fleet and the balance is private,’ he reasons. Even in a low penetration space like private, it means a high penetration in fleet.
“When I have to build electrification as a transformative exercise in the industry, why categorise EV as a fleet offering? On the contrary, it should be something aspirational, and a very compelling case for a buyer,” observes Chandra.
From his point of view, the company has created a package for Nexon EV in terms of world class technology and Freedom 2.0, which means “breaking all barriers regarding range, price, charging, the whole anxiety of technology resale value etc”.
These are the parameters/philosophy around Ziptron, Tata Motors’ electric powertrain technology, where the idea is to bring a car which can enter the mass market and come under the mainstream consideration. “Otherwise, we would be only addressing 5 per cent of the market of over ₹15 lakh,” he says. Even in these pricier products, the focus is “too much” on addressing the anxiety of range even though actual city driving is barely 40-50 km daily. “Even if you deliver a 300 km range car, the user will have to charge the vehicle only once a week,’ adds Chandra. 
He is reasonably confident that two years from now, charging infrastructure should improve. Additionally, as battery prices come down and prices of the internal combustion engine (ICE) increase with BS-VI emission norms, there will be more demand for electric options. 
“The key is to hit the sweet spot: either you give a high range or price but there is a certain optimisation level that the customer wants and this is what we have tried to do with Nexon,” says Chandra.
In short, this is an ideal price point which becomes a lot more accessible to customers. It is also based on research Tata Motors had done with the help of AC Nielsen, where 80 per cent of respondents said they were considering an EV. This survey was carried out a year ago even, before the clamour on EVs began and it was evident that customers were open to the idea so long as it involved paying 25-30 per cent more than their ICE option…nothing more!
Chandra then points out to the Nexon automatic which retails at about ₹12.5 lakh. At 25 per cent higher, its EV sibling will be ₹16 lakh. “The customer will then have the appetite for an EV which has better performance, drivability etc,” he says. 
Beyond this, there is a package and value proposition offered in the form of an eight year warranty which means that even if he/she would want to sell the Nexon EV in four years, it is not a big deal. According to Chandra, the vehicle is the first EV of its kind with “very high performance” that matches all the underlying strengths of a ₹25 lakh car at ₹15 lakh and in a segment which is growing very fast.
This also puts in context the reason to choose a model like Nexon in the electric space since a value proposition will also have to go hand in hand with easier acceptability in the market. Hence, the 25-30 per cent premium over ICE (as gleaned from the AC Nielsen study) would not have worked with a hatchback, at least for now. 
“Maybe three years down the line, it could be conceived when battery prices fall and ICE prices increase with BS-VI/CAFE intervention. There will then be an opportunity to create value for the customer and business which should be sustainable eventually,” says Chandra. 
It is also a no-brainer that if the country needs to build electrification, EVs should not be confined to the fleet segment and perceived merely as taxis. After all, this becomes easily synonymous with ‘cheap’ and could end up damaging the brand.
Hence, reiterates Chandra, there is more reason for the Centre to open up the FAME 2 incentives to the personal segment, too. “It will then take off. Just imagine what this would mean to offerings like the Nexon EV, which would then become a lot closer to the ICE alternative (in pricing),” he says. 
Apart from this, there would be other pluses like good drivability, low maintenance and operating costs. Tata Motors does not intend to open up the Nexon EV to the fleet segment but would be okay with applications like the rental business where there is a private user. 
“This is the way to protect the brand and we are proactively working here so that people can have the opportunity to experiment with it before choosing to buy the Nexon EV,’ says Chandra. Likewise, the company is also open to its use in hotel-airport transfers or for ferrying senior executives within a city.
From its point of view, no car from Ziptron will have a range of below 250 km and this was one of the underlying principles in addition to battery warranty, etc. “Today, I am doing 300 km but will be keen on something more in the next three years to stay competitive,” says Chandra. 
Interestingly, suppliers were not so enthusiastic about electric till about a year ago, which was understandable given their investments on BS-VI coupled with anxieties about the slowdown. As Chandra recalls, they were “very defensive till last year” but the picture has changed over the last three or four months.
“Lots of sentiments change when there is a lot of noise and in electric this has not been lacking in recent times,” he adds good-naturedly. At a more serious level, though, with new launches and more debates on electric, suppliers are now aware that something is happening.
Chandra maintains that there is no need for them to worry in a car market which is slated to grow three-fold to nine million units by 2030. Of this, 30 per cent will be electric, which means three million units (the size of today’s market).
“Still, the balance six million units will be ICE, which means it will be twice today’s levels and hence where is the issue of job losses etc. This is an additional opportunity for every entrepreneur to work on with new skill requirements,” says Chandra. The big change will happen when electric gets into the zone of hatchbacks and its adoption starts increasing rapidly."
6,2019-12-12,Tata Motors,"Tata Altroz Review 
Tata Motors is being bitten by the very bugs that were its allies in the past. Overwhelmed by the hype, and feeling underwhelmed by the cars themselves of a decade ago, customers continue to be wary of buying Tata’s models of today. The stables have been cleaned out and the vehicles on sale now are a bunch of healthy, relatively reliable, well-designed products that have been awarded high ratings for safety by global agencies. Yet, the market’s response has been lukewarm. 
Tata models of the past five years, including the Tiago/ Tigor, the Hexa, Nexon and the Harrier have been pointers to the level of maturity that the brand has reached as a car maker. All of them have featured great design, updated tech, and decent finish quality and build. There are still some areas where Tata cars need to catch up, but with each new model that gap is being bridged. The latest model to join the lineup will be the Altroz, which when launched next month will help Tata fill another yawning gap in its portfolio. I drove the Altroz last week and I think it represents the culmination of a decade of concerted efforts at improving the refinement and dynamics of their cars. It is time to give Tata a second chance. 
 Yes, there are rough edges in the Altroz, but very few of them and mostly in the ergonomics side. In general, there is a sense of everything having come together nicely in the Altroz, starting with the design. The B+ segment (premium hatch) has seen very few recent additions and the Altroz promises to inject some freshness into the category. The design of this new hatch stands out from the current crop, which should work in its favour. The cab forward design that has been a regular from Tata is still very much alive in the Altroz too. But, the design is a nice mix of elements that makes the hatch look like it also has the flavour of a high-set crossover. 
The steeply sloped bonnet starts with the signature Humanity line which we have seen in all of the last five cars from the brand. The nose is extremely prominent thanks to the glossy black band that runs across the top of the bonnet grille and over the headlamps like a brow. To shake off that attention-grabbing feature, it gets chrome under-lipping that runs the width of the grille and wraps around the bottom edge of the headlamps. The chunky front fender with what looks like a large airdam, also houses the cornering fog lamps. The simple, elegantly designed bonnet slab merges into a slim A-pillar and a steeply raked roofline. The bulging wheel arches are big contributors to the crossover hints in the Altroz’s design. Following a family design language, the front window has a kink where the waistline dips right after the quarter glass and rises up to follow a straight line to the rear, helping reduce the blind spot. But the thick A-pillar does take away the advantage. 
The rear of the Altroz features a three-dimensional, layered design. The tail-lamps are sort of bug-eyed protrusions from the body of the car and the fender is two chiseled layers. In the top trim variant that I was testing, there was a glossy black panel adorning the portion of the tailgate between and over the top of the two tail-lamps, to create a sort of matching theme to the front. The rear design makes the Altroz look wide and squat, while the rising belt-line continues to give it crossover traits. The ground clearance is 165mm, though from the pictures it’ll seem like the car is sprung higher. With the rear seats in place, the boot space is 345 litres. Viewed from the side, the windows are nicely framed by the thick, glossy black window graphic trim, somewhat like the Nexon’s white stripe. 
The fit and finish and quality of materials on the outside is really good, with excellently painted panels and consistently tight shutlines. So, the expectations from the cabin are as already heightened as I step in. The competition is intense with cars like the Hyundai i20, in which the cabin feels as good or better than many sedans. So, the Altroz’s cabin has to match these benchmarks. Slipping behind the wheel, I discover that the interior features a pleasing mix of materials and features that are modern and match most, if not all, of the other cars in the segment in terms of quality. The layout of the dashboard is fairly conventional, though the design manages to highlight each of the elements in it. Matt grey panels at the top and glossy silver panels at the front give the dash contrasting elements. Hidden LED ambient lighting gives some more character to the cabin and highlight features like the floating panel at the top of the centre stack, which houses the 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system. 
The seats, the firm cushioning and the fabric upholstery feel good to sit on. Legroom is adequate both at the front and the rear even for tall passengers, though I suspect that the Baleno and Jazz may have a bit more kneeroom. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find a dead pedal in the Altroz. Also, the choice of material for the textured dashboard plastic panels is good, though there is still considerable glare on the windscreen. Fit and finish of the switches, knobs and controls are also good. It was good to note that the Altroz’s cabin also gets all the latest gadgets and features like auto headlamps, auto wipers etc in the top trim variant that I was driving. Instrument cluster features a combination of an analog speedo, and a digital info and rpm-meter. Toggling the menu button on the steering gets you to switch between screens that display real-time mileage, average mileage, distance to empty and an interesting representation of the power and torque in use and available real-time. The sporty flat-bottomed, multi-function steering wheel also felt great to hold and use. A Harman music system, a dual-shelf glovebox and a umbrella holder in the front door panels are some of the other interesting features in the cabin. 
The Altroz is being offered with the petrol and diesel engines that we have already seen in the Tigor and Nexon, but at different output levels. The 3-cylinder, 1,199cc Revotron petrol engine in the Altroz is BS6 compliant, and generates a peak power of 86PS and peak torque of 113Nm. The engine is paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. 
The diesel unit is the Revotorq, 4-cylinder, 1,497cc, turbocharged and intercooled engine. This engine is also BS6 compliant, and without the need for an ammonia tank. In the Altroz, the engine delivers a peak output of 90PS and a peak torque of 200Nm. A 5-speed manual gearbox is the choice here too. Both the engines are likely to get automatic transmissions soon and the choice may be DCTs (dual clutch); whether they’d be wearing a JTP badge is something we are going to have to wait to see. 
The engines are both good choices for the Altroz and both fairly peppy units. The three-pot petrol is the surprise here, delivering a fairly sprightly performance once it gets on the go. The only bit that is a dampener is throttle response which feels a bit muted in the Eco driving cycle and is only a shade better in the City mode. A Sport mode would have been a welcome addition, though I think it is probably being saved for the DCT endowed variant. There is some amount of transmission noise that gets into the cabin and in the diesel variant I drove had a bit of vibration at the steering too. The manual gearbox shift quality is good, though with the tall stick, the throw is fairly long and really quick shifts are it’s forte. Noise levels inside the cabin have been contained. Powertrain noise inside the cabin is not intrusive, and though I could hear the engine even at mid-revs, unlike some of the other gruff 3-cylinders, this one sounds good. Brake setup features discs at the front and drums at the rear, and ABS with EBD is standard fitment across variants. Braking is progressive and the Altroz feels stable under hard emergency braking. 
The ride quality is as good as competitors like the Maruti Suzuki Baleno and Honda Jazz, thanks to a fairly sorted suspension setup. The Altroz feels light and easy to turn at slow speeds and very planted at high speeds with the steering weighing up nicely too. There is no loss of composure or edgy feeling even when it is being pushed at its limits. However, it doesn’t feel as planted and its handling isn’t as confidence inspiring as the segment benchmark - the Volkswagen Polo. The Goodyear rubber that my test mules came shod with had high grip limits, so no squealing even when taking corners at high speed. Both the diesel and petrol versions sported 16-inch rims, but the petrol was shod with wider and slightly lower profile 195/55 tyres. 
The Altroz has been built on a brand new modular platform called ALFA which is likely to spawn more models with different body styles over the next few years, including electrics. While the architecture’s overall strengths look promising based on the Altroz’s performance, it also delivers some structural benefits to the new premium hatch. These include the wide, 90-degree opening of all four doors and the flat (no transmission tunnel) floor at the rear of the Altroz. 
There are minor ergonomics issues inside the cabin that can be overlooked. But, the overall refinement levels of the Altroz will still be a shade lower than the i20 and the Jazz. The Altroz will be offered with four trim variants and customers can customise their cars irrespective of which variant they have chosen. 
The Altroz’s potential for consistent performance and long term reliability looks promising. But, I think to bridge the trust deficit Tata Motors should consider conquest pricing when its first premium hatch is launched next month."

 Tata Motors expects commercial vehicle (CV) business to remain in slow lane for the next few months and witness turnaround only by the second half of the next fiscal, a top company official said.
 With demand expected to remain muted, the company aims to go slow in introducing BS-VI compliant CVs in the domestic market. “My read is that the first half of the next fiscal particularly in CV segment is unpredictable,” Tata Motors CEO and MD Guenter Butschek told PTI.
 The growth in CV industry is related to the country’s economy, he added. “The government has launched various initiatives...all these factors are going to give us a positive outlook in the second half of the next fiscal,” he said. While the transition to BS-VI in passenger vehicles (PV) is on track, the company is going to be slow in introducing upgraded CVs in the market due to low demand, he added.
 “For PVs the transition is going to happen in the next few weeks, in CV segment situation is slightly different not because we are running late but due to a different market situation,” Butschek said. In CV segment, the company is “not actively” going to switch to BS-VI before April 1, 2020, he added.
 “Our read of the market is there will not be too much of a demand ..our BS-VI play starts on April 1, prior to that it is BS-IV products,”Butschek noted. As per SIAM data, CV sales declined by 14.98 per cent to 61,907 units in November as compared with the year-ago period.
 During April-November, CV sales have declined by 22.12 per cent to 5,04,080 units as against 6,47,278 units in same period of 2018-19. In domestic market, the company reported a 29 per cent fall in CV sales to 2,17,130 units in the current financial year as compared with 3,05,395 units in April-November period of 2018-19. 
 Butschek said the company has embarked upon a “mission zero” to see that no BS-IV vehicle is left after April 1, 2020. “By the end of this fiscal, Tata Motors is not going to have a BS IV vehicle left, neither any material which was initially ordered to manufacture BS-IV vehicles..weekly meeting now has become a daily affair,” Butschek said."
3,2019-12-19,Tata Motors,"Tata Group stocks remain under pressure after NCLAT order 
 Shares of various Tata Group companies remained under pressure on Thursday as well, falling up to 2 per cent in morning trade, after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) restored Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons Chairman.
 Tata Power Company fell 1.62 per cent, Tata Coffee declined 1.52 per cent, Tata Metaliks dipped 1.60 per cent, Tata Steel 1.46 per cent and Tata Communications 1.23 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in early trade.
 The scrip of Tata Global Beverages fell 0.89 per cent, Indian Hotels Company slipped 0.62 per cent, Titan Company 0.46 per cent, Tata Motors 0.37, Tata Investment Corporation 0.14 per cent and Tata Consultancy Services stock fell 0.10 per cent.
 However, later some of these scrips such as Tata Motors and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) bounced back and were trading with gains.
 Various group scrips had fallen up to 4 per cent in the previous trade after the order.
 In a big win for Cyrus Mistry, a company law appeals court on Wednesday restored him as executive chairman of Tata Sons and ruled that appointment of N Chandrasekaran as head of the holding company of over $110 billion salt-to-software conglomerate was illegal.
 It, however, stayed the operation of the order with respect to reinstatement for four weeks to allow Tatas to appeal.
 Mistry, scion of the wealthy Shapoorji Pallonji family, had in December 2012 succeeded Ratan Tata as the Executive Chairman of Tata Sons, a post that also made him the head of all Tata group listed firms such as Tata Power and Tata Motors. 
 In an overnight coup, he was removed as the Chairman of Tata Sons in October 2016. Along with him, the entire senior management too was purged and Ratan Tata was back at the helms of affairs four years after he took retirement."

Tata Motors on Thursday unveiled Nexon EV, the company’s first electric SUV for personal buyers which uses the company’s new electric vehicle technology platform Ziptron. 
In September, Tata Motors had announced a shift in its EV strategy with a focus on the personal segment by introducing Ziptron. Ziptron is aimed at finding solutions to common concerns around EVs like range, power, durability, safety and charging infrastructure.
Scheduled to be launched in January 2020, the Nexon EV is expected to be priced between Rs 15 to 17 lakhs. Bookings for Nexon EV will begin from tomorrow onwards(December 20), at a rate of Rs 21,000. It can be booked either through company’s official website or through select authorized dealers.
The company claimed that the Nexon EV delivers a range of more than 300 kms on a single charge. “When plugged into a Fast DC Charger, the Nexon EV will replenish 80 per cent battery capacity within 60 minutes. In addition, the Nexon EV can be charged from any 15 amp plug point,” the company said.
“After introducing our cutting-edge EV technology, Ziptron, we are thrilled to unveil the first EV featuring this technology – The Nexon EV. This is a high performance, connected vehicle that is uniquely suited to address the aspirations of Indian customers and break all barriers for EV adoption. We are confident that this development will mark an important milestone in India’s electrification journey, and further reinforce our commitment towards developing sustainable and responsible mobility solutions for India,” said Guenter Butschek, CEO & MD, Tata Motors.
In October, the company started selling Tigor EV for personal buyers, making it Tata Motors’ first electric car for personal buyers. Until then, it was limited to sales to the Government and commercial fleet buyers.
The car will come with a warranty of eight years or 1,60,000 kms - whichever is earlier - on battery and motor. Nexon EV is equipped with a 129 PS permanent-magnet AC motor powered by a 30.2 kWh lithium-ion battery.
Tata Motors’ new EV will be launched in three variants – XZ+ LUX, XZ+  and XM. It will be available in three colour options – Signature Teal Blue colour, Moonlit Silver and Glacier White. Nexon EV also offers 35 mobile app based connected features."

Tata Motors, which unveiled the Nexon EV, its first electric car on Thursday for personal buyers using Ziptron - the company’s new electric vehicle technology platform - is bullish on the nascent EV market.
The overall EV market can attain a penetration of 10-15 per cent in the next 5-6 years, driven by sales in the personal segment too, said Shailesh Chandra, President – Electric Mobility Business & Corporate Strategy.
Currently, electric cars mostly cater to the fleet segment in the country. Only around 1,500 electric cars were sold for personal use in the last eight months, according to Sohinder Gill, Director General, Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles.
The Nexon EV is expected to be priced between Rs 15 to 17 lakh when it is launched in January.
As more and more products with a value proposition similar to that of Nexon EV enter the market, the electric cars market will also expand, he said. From the first quarter to the third quarter of this year, the EV market has already grown 2.5-3 times, he said. “So, next year, I believe that there is no reason why the (overall EV) market cannot (be) double the size of today,” Chandra told BusinessLine.
 Tata Motors will also be launching another electric car, Altroz EV, next year.
In September, Tata Motors announced a shift in its EV strategy with a focus on the personal segment by introducing Ziptron.
Ziptron is aimed at finding solutions to common concerns around EVs like range, power, durability, safety and charging infrastructure.
Electric cars for personal buyers will see a steep adoption, as the overall market for automobiles is “heavily skewed” towards the personal segment, with the fleet segment taking up just a small fraction of the market, Chandra explained. He said that the fleet segment only constitutes 10 per cent of the total passenger car market, whereas 90 per cent of the industry caters to the personal segment.
If the government extends the benefits under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) and Electric Vehicles scheme (FAME) to the personal segment as well, the potential for electric cars in the personal segment can be even bigger, he said. Currently, FAME benefits are not applicable to personal buyers of electric cars.
Chandra said that the FAME scheme should be extended to the personal car segment as well, when asked about his expectations from the government to propel sales of electric cars for personal buyers.
Tata Motors’ EV strategy centre around creating optimisation parameters, he said.
“Nexon EV is an example of how you optimize performance, range and price, rather than dialling up significantly on one of them,” he said. He said that with this product, concerns around the range anxiety, price and performance are taken care of.
Tata Motors claimed that the Nexon EV delivers an anxiety free long range of more than 300 km on a single charge. When plugged into a Fast DC Charger, the Nexon EV will replenish 80 per cent battery capacity within 60 minutes. In addition, the Nexon EV can be charged from any 15 amp plug point, it said. The car will come with a warranty of eight years or 1.60 lakh kms - whichever is earlier - on battery and motor.
“It is a value proposition which is well packaged to really trigger excitement among consumers. Because otherwise, for any other offering (until now), there was compromise on one (factor) or the other. This (Nexon EV) is the first real package, I would say, which has been thought through from a consumer perspective. It is not a cut-pasted solution. We have attempted to do the right thing, thinking from a consumer mindset,” said Chandra."
