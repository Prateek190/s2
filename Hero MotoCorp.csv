Following the drop in profits in the first two quarters of this fiscal, Hero MotoCorp has continued to put up a lacklustre show in the three months ended December 2018. While sales grew by 7.5 per cent to ₹7,865 crore over the December 2017 quarter, net profits fell by 4.4 per cent to ₹769 crore pre-dominantly due to cost pressures.
Volumes for the company grew by 5.2 per cent during the quarter. But revenue from operations grew at a higher 7.5 per cent, pointing to higher realisations. Average realisations grew by about 2 per cent to ₹43,721 per vehicle. A better product mix from the launch of the Xtreme 200R premium bike in September as well as the XPulse 200T in November could have partly helped the improvement in realisations.
However, this performance could not carry through to the bottom-line. Raw material cost, as a percentage of sales, inched up from 68.7 per cent in the September quarter of last year to 69.6 per cent now.
Even as the company hiked prices by ₹900 per vehicle in October to pass on increase in input prices, operating margin contracted by 180 basis points to 14 per cent in the December quarter.
While taxes too inched up by 14 per cent, it was a 70 per cent increase in other income that prevented the net profits from slipping sharply.
With Bajaj Auto shifting strategy to focus on volumes rather than margins, the company has been posing stiff competition to Hero in its core entry bikes (75-110 cc) segment in the last three quarters. For the nine months ended December, Hero’s volumes in this segment grew only by about 15 per cent, compared with the 60 per cent growth clocked by Bajaj Auto.
As a result, Hero’s market share in entry bikes for the first nine months of this fiscal has slipped to 71.7 per cent against 73.7 per cent registered in the same period last year.
Besides, though scooter sales have slowed so far this fiscal, the industry still shows a 4 per cent volume growth. Hero has fared a lot worse, with volumes dropping by 13 per cent this fiscal.
In the last few months, demand for discretionary items such as new vehicles and durables have waned, thanks to high interest rates, rise in fuel costs as well as tight liquidity among NBFCs which affected lending.
Rural consumers have also been reluctant due to patchy monsoons coupled with crash in farm prices.
Given that the company‘s ride has been bumpy, the Hero Moto Corp stock has lost about 29 in the last one year. To make up for the loss in market share in the entry segment, Hero is improving its product mix in the executive and premium segments.
To regain lost share in scooters, it has recently launched the Destini, in the more popular 125 cc segment.
Prospects for the company could improve if the budget announces measures to boost rural consumption as the company has a strong rural footprint.

22,2019-02-13,Hero MotoCorp,"Hero MotoCorp hits over a week low; may fall further
 Shares of Hero MotoCorp Ltd fall as much as 2.66 per cent to ₹2,725, lowest since Feb. 4
The stock has broken below a support at ₹2,766.70, the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci projection level of the downtrend from December 20, 2018 high to January 31, 2019 low (wave a) 
This suggests, in the near term stock may fall up to the next support at ₹2,647.15, the 38.2 per cent projection level
The stock's price crossed below its Parabolic SAR (stop and reverse) point; and a cross below the SAR point is seen as a signal to close long positions and enter into short position.
The RSI line failed to cross above the 60 points mark during the rally last week, which is seen as a bearish signal
The stock was down 9.82 per cent this year as of last close, compared with the broader NSE index's 0.29 pct fall in the same period"
21,2019-04-28,Hero MotoCorp,"Hero MotoCorp is poised above a key base 
Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
Can I buy Hero MotoCorp at the current price?
TVS Prakash Rao
Hero MotoCorp (₹2,604.1): The stock of Hero MotoCorp was on a long-term uptrend since taking support at around ₹1,450 in 2013 and it recorded a new high at ₹4,200 in August 2017. Subsequently, it changed direction and has been in an intermediate-term downtrend. The medium-term trend is also down for the stock.
In December, the stock encountered a key resistance at ₹3,360 and resumed the downtrend. But a significant support in the ₹2,500-2,560 band has been providing base since January this year. The stock had tumbled almost 5 per cent, witnessing selling pressure in the previous week. It currently hovers above the significant support band.








 
Both the daily and the weekly indicators are showing signs of weakness. An emphatic plunge below ₹2,500 can drag the stock down to ₹2,300 and ₹2,200 in the medium term.
Next key long-term support is placed at ₹2,200, which can cushion the stock. An upward reversal from this support is possible.
Subsequent support below ₹2,200 is at ₹2,000. You can wait and consider buying the stock at around ₹2,300 with a long-term stop-loss at ₹2,000.
On the upside, a decisive rally above the immediate resistance at ₹2,750 can take the stock up to ₹2,900 and ₹3,000 levels. An emphatic break above ₹3,000 will alter the medium-term downtrend and take it up to ₹3,200 and ₹3,400 in the medium term.
To alter the intermediate-term downtrend the stock needs to decisively move above the vital resistance in the ₹3,500-3,550 band.
Such a break can take it further higher to ₹3,800 and ₹4,000 over the long run. Investors with a long-term perspective can hold the stock with a stop-loss at ₹2,000.
I want to buy the share of Amara Raja. What should be my target over the next one to three years?
Sudhin Bathija
Amara Raja Batteries (₹667.5): The stock of Amara Raja Batteries is trending down and currently tests a key long-term support in the ₹650-665 band. A strong tumble below ₹650 will reinforce the downtrend that has been in place since the stock encountered a key resistance at ₹1,050 in 2016.








 
The medium as well as short-term trends are down for the stock. A decline below ₹650 can drag the stock down to ₹600 and ₹550 over the medium term. You can consider buying at lower levels with a long-term stop-loss at ₹540. To alter the short-term downtrend, the stock needs to decisively break above ₹730. Next key resistances above ₹730 are placed at ₹780 and ₹800.
A further rally above ₹800 will change the medium-term downtrend and take the stock higher to ₹850 and ₹900 levels. It needs to conclusively move above ₹900 to bring back bullish momentum and a rally to ₹950 and ₹1,000 is then possible over the long term.

20,2019-04-30,Hero MotoCorp,"Hero MotoCorp falls after March-quarter profit misses target
Shares of Hero MotoCorp Ltd, the country's largest motorcycle maker, fell 3 per cent on Tuesday, their biggest intra-day per cent loss in over two months.
Slowing growth of passenger vehicle sales hurt the company's profit, which missed the consensus for March-quarter profit on Friday.
Two-wheeler demand has weakened post the new insurance norms in September and the cost push from regulatory changes over the next one year will be a further drag for the company, according to CLSA.
The Indian auto industry body said earlier this month, passenger vehicle sales are expected to grow between 3 and 5 per cent in the current FY, after expanding at the slowest pace in five years last year.
CLSA also sees margin headwinds for all two-wheeler makers due to new safety and emission norms, amid weak demand and high competition.
The company's shares have fallen about 16 per cent YTD, as of Friday's close. The stock ended at Rs 2,512.65, down Rs 91.50 (-3.51%) on the BSE."
19,2019-05-02,Hero MotoCorp,"Hero’s new trio brings a breath of fresh air to portfolio 
Hero MotoCorp’s overly commuter focused portfolio of motorcycles always had a couple of bright spots. The Karizma is one of them and the Impulse was one of them. With performance bike buyers maturing and moving on to larger engine displacement motorcycles, Hero’s portfolio needed a unique bike like the Impulse. Unfortunately, it seems to have been a bit ahead of its time; or was a combination of that and ergonomic issues that users faced while riding this off-road style motorcycle. Meant to be a raised, dual-character motorcycle which was part dirt bike, part premium commuter, the Impulse didn’t entirely deliver on its promises, even though it was fun to ride.
A much delayed but welcome commitment to own research and development during the last few years has led to a slew of new products from Hero. While the initial outcomes were mostly facelifts and quality improvements on existing product lines, more substantial changes, product overhauls and completely new platforms are on the way, of which there is none more impressive than the latest platform shared by the trio of bikes launched earlier this week. The new XPulse 200, 200T and the Xtreme 200S share the same engine, gearbox and chassis, but have a fairly different character each based on their positioning. One is an on-road-cum-off-road bike, another a tourer and the third is a sporty, urban premium bike meant for buyers in the entry performance segment. 
Earlier this week I travelled to Bengaluru to test-ride the 200 and 200T, and here are my first impressions.
The most interesting of the trio has to be the adventure, dirt bike style XPulse 200. For a moment there it looks like a ‘Mod’ with over-raised stance, long travel front forks, the upswept exhaust and dual front fenders. But, its finish quality and premium features are clearly market -driven and manufacturer-derived. However, the XPulse 200 isn’t completely clean and fresh. Some of the design features like the fuel tank are traditional, and even attempt to refer back to Hero’s existing bikes, something that is not necessarily the most ideal. But, the rest of the bike is still very purposeful and appealing for its adventure positioning. The stalked hand guards, the retro-design circular headlamps with LED bulbs and the beak-like raised half fender at the front give the XPulse 200 a definite off-road bike air. Unlike the Impulse, which missed a few ergonomic features, this new bike gets all the features that will keep the rider safe and protected even in the rare event that he does take the bike off-road. So, an aluminium skid plate, and half fender for the rear portion of the front wheel ensure protection from the weather and loose gravel, for both the bike and the rider.
The XPulse 200 sports a 21-inch front wheel and 18-inch rear wheel, and 90/90 and 120/80 tyres respectively. The bike thus gets a good, raised stance, though the saddle height is still a manageably low 823mm; and the ground clearance is 220mm (Impulse was 240mm). The XPulse 200, the 200T and the XTreme 200S share the same high tensile steel frame, and the same 199.6cc air-cooled engine in the same state of tune. In fact, most of the brake and suspension parts are also similar with minor variations to suit the character and positioning of the bikes. Cast parts, handlebars and other accessories are a mix of common and unique bits. The XPulse 200 gets a clear plexiglass windshield and a luggage plate with bungee hooks in place of the usual rear grab rail, both of these are practical and also contribute to the adventure bike styling.
With retro-styled bikes making a huge comeback and the undying appeal of a brand like Royal Enfield, urging other bike makers to also explore this genre, Hero’s 200T is probably making its entry at the right time. Almost as long as the 200, the Tourer variant is designed to fit into the character of an easy-riding touring bike that is targeted at young urban riders. It features a shorter wheelbase, lowered height (269mm less) and a lower set saddle height (799mm) too compared to the XPulse 200. The ground clearance is also lower at 178mm. The riding position is still upright and not committed, though it is a tad less comfortable compared to the 200.
The tourer also gets 17-inch wheels at both the front and the rear, though the rear tyre is a wider 130/70, compared to the deeper tread 100/80 at the front. The seat is a fairly flat unit, though it is wide enough and accommodating. The seat cover, though, was a slippery, tightly wrapped skin that left my back side hurting at the end of the 200+km ride. I was told by Hero officials that these were pre-production units and that the final spec includes a ribbed, cushioned seat that will be more comfortable. 
There were a couple of niggles involving the electricals in both bikes during my test ride that I was told was also due to the same reason. Rider ergonomics are similar in both the bikes with the handlebar position, seat height, mildly forward biased foot pegs position and the knee recesses in the tanks of both bikes being very comfortable.
Both the bikes get similar electricals, with the switchgear and even the LCD instrument panel with its display configuration and Bluetooth enabled turn-by-turn navigation features remaining identical. Other hardware that is identical are the brakes, with both the bikes getting 276mm disc brakes with single channel ABS at the front and 220mm discs at the rear – the only difference is the XPulse 200 gets petal discs, instead of the regular circular ones in the 200T.
The engine is also shared, with the 199.6cc, 4-stroke, 2-valve, single cylinder engine producing 18.4PS of peak power at 8,000rpm and peak torque of 17.1Nm. The 200T is offered only as a caburetted version, while the 200 is offered as a fuel injected version. Both use a multi-plate wet clutch and the same 5-speed constant mesh gearbox. The ratios are also identical, though there is a marginal difference in on-road behaviour between the two bikes. There is a marginal difference in kerb weight, and the XPulse 200 is a shade heavier at 154kgs.
The engine will not feel underpowered in either of the two bikes when they are being used in the city. But, out on the highway in the outskirts of Bengaluru, the bikes did feel like they could do with a bit more at top-end. Gear shift quality is good; the clutch is also progressive and false neutrals were rare. 
The bikes are stable even at triple digit speeds, and don’t feel either heavy or over-light to manoeuvre. The riding position and composed handling, while going through potholes or speedbreakers, was actually better on the XPulse 200. 
The 200T was also prone to distracting vibrations at the handlebar and footpegs at lower speeds compared to the 200. So, while the top speed that the XPulse 200 managed was about 120kmph, the 200T topped off at 110kmph, and the vibrations started getting to me earlier in the 200T (by about 90kmph). Apparently that could be because of the XPulse 200’s hand guards behaving like additional bar-end weights and difference in tyres directing away some of the vibrations.
The suspension in both the XPulse 200 and the 200T feature 37mm diameter front forks at the front, with the former getting a longer 190mm stroke. The rear sports monoshocks and while the 200T gets a 7-step adjustable unit, the 200 in keeping with its off-road ability gets a 10-step adjust with a floating piston allowing for a 170mm wheel travel. 
The diamond type rigid frame and box-section swing arm contribute to a fairly rigid, yet responsive handling. Overall on the performance front, for bikes in the premium/entry performance segment, these two new entrants are good.
Hero MotoCorp has announced very approachable prices for the trio of new bikes starting at ₹94,000 for the 200T and going up to ₹1.05 lakh for the XPulse 200 FI."

Xtreme 200S




Xtreme 200S


Hero MotoCorp has launched Xtreme 200S, a full-faired motorcycle with more sporty character and various new elements to the 200cc segment, priced at ₹98,500 (ex-showroom, Delhi).
The new sports bike comes after the Xtreme 200R which was launched during the festive season (second quarter) of last year. It is the fourth motorcycle in the X Series that the company has launched during recent times and is meant to ignite premium customers with distinct aspirations.
Said to be targeted at today’s smart generation that is looking for both — character and comfort — in their daily city ride, the Xtreme 200S comes with an all new aerodynamic fairing for a sporty stance and better wind protection on the highways, the company said, adding that a compact exhaust adds to the sleek appeal.
The motorcycle has a full LED headlamp and tail lights, Bluetooth connectivity, turn-by-turn navigation, chiselled rear cowl design, anti-slip seats and full digital LCD cluster that includes gear indicator, trip meter and service reminder.
The 200cc air-cooled engine is capable of delivering 18.4 PS power and 17.1 Nm torque. The Xtreme 200S additionally comes with 7-step adjustable mono shock suspension for better handling, and 276 mm front disc with single channel ABS and 220 mm rear disc brakes system for added safety.
The motorcycle has 17-inch wheels and 100/80-17 front tyre and a wide 130/70-R17 at the rear, for that better grip and stability and the wheelbase is 1337mm. The Xtreme 200S has a kerb weight of 149 kg and a fuel tank capacity of 12.5 litres. To enhance the sporty appeal, the motorcycle will be offered in three colours — Sports Red, Maple Brown and Panther Black."

India’s car stocks have lost $42 billion in value in the last 16 months, and some analysts say the rout may not be over.
A gauge of automobile companies has fallen 30 per cent since reaching a record in December 2017, and is the worst-performer among the 19 sector indexes in the nation’s equity market this year, even as the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index rallied to a fresh peak last month.
A slowdown in consumption, amid a cash crunch in the banking system, has left carmakers with a pile of unsold vehicles in what was one of the world’s fastest-growing auto market until last year. Little surprise then that Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd are among the biggest decliners on the Sensex this year, notching losses of up to 20 per cent."

15,2019-06-10,Hero MotoCorp,"Hero Splendor iSmart becomes first two-wheeler with BS-VI certification


Representational image




Representational image


The International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT) on Monday awarded India’s first Type Approval Certificate for two-wheelers complying with BS-VI norms to Hero Motocorp’s Splendor iSmart.
The Type Approval Certification involves a manufacturer building a prototype and getting it certified, so that it can commence manufacturing of the vehicle. Hero said that the BS-VI-compliant Splendor has been developed at its facility near Jaipur in Rajasthan.
Dinesh Tyagi, Director, ICAT, congratulated “home-grown” manufacturer Hero for becoming the first in the country to get BS-VI certification. “The BS-VI emission standards are much more elaborate in their scope, and integrate substantial changes to existing emission standards, ensuring cleaner products to the consumer,” he said.
When the 2020 move to BS-VI was announced, there were apprehensions in the industry on whether it would be able to prepare itself for this technological shift. Even now, there are questions on how much the initial price of a vehicle would increase by under the BS-VI regime. Industry experts believed that the rise in cost could be in the vicinity of ₹10,000 for two-wheelers.
As BS-VI regulations raise the bar on NOx emissions, the fuel consumed by the engine increases. Tyagi pegged the increase between 5-12 per cent, based on inputs he received from OEMs. “When you try to control NOx, there is a natural impact on the fuel consumption,” he said, adding that OEMs did request that the NOx limit be considered so as to maintain fuel consumption.
However, they all agreed to look at other methods to improve fuel consumption, such as weight reduction.
Tyagi said that ICAT would invest ₹45 crore on EV specialisation by October this year.
ICAT also has certification services for EVs and has already certified hybrid vehicles such as the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz and Honda Accord. However, Tyagi said that there are significant challenges ahead before India fully adopts EVs.
These include lack of a lithium-ion battery manufacturing base, inadequate charging infrastructure and lukewarm response from customers."

In its commitment to stay ahead of the emerging mobility trends, country's largest two-wheeler manufacturer, Hero MotoCorp on Tuesday said it has revamped its leadership team. Hero MotoCorp has created the ‘Emerging Mobility’ Business Unit to give an impetus to new mobility trends such as Electric Vehicles (EVs), the company said.
As part of this process, Hero MotoCorp has assigned the role of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) to Vikram Kasbekar, while Rajat Bhargava has been given the responsibility to head the newly created ‘Emerging Mobility’ Business Unit. Both of them will continue to report to Pawan Munjal, Chairman, Hero MotoCorp. Bhargava currently heads Corporate Strategy and Performance Transformation and is also Head of Global Business.
Kasbekar, currently the Executive Director – Operations (Plants) at Hero MotoCorp, will be in-charge of the Company’s world-class Research and Development (R&D) facilities - the Centre of Innovation and Technology (CIT) - at the Northern Indian city of Jaipur and the Hero Tech Centre Germany GmbH. He will replace Markus Braunsperger, who will be relocating to Europe after the completion of his five-year tenure.
Research and development
Markus, who led CIT from its days of inception, has been credited with giving shape to the research and development set-up at Hero MotoCorp, forming a global team of engineers and automotive experts drawn from different parts of the world. Under the leadership of Markus, Hero successfully launched close to 40 new models and variants including a series of premium two-wheelers, including the XPulse range motorcycles, the Destini 125 and Maestro Edge 125 scooters.

He also led the Company to a smooth transition from BS-III to BS-IV earlier and to BS-VI now, as Hero MotoCorp became the first manufacturer in India to receive the BS-VI certification for a two-wheeler from the International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT). He also played a key role in setting up Hero Tech Centre Germany and giving Hero MotoSports a major boost.
Kasbekar, who has been with Hero MotoCorp for over a decade and half, brings years of varied technology and engineering experience in manufacturing and large-scale plant operations, Supply Chain and New Model Development.
A process has already been initiated to identify a suitable candidate to be in line to take over as CTO in due course, the company added."

Hero MotoCorp’s exceptional gain came from the reversal of a National Calamity Contingent Duty fund for one of its plants (file photo)




Hero MotoCorp’s exceptional gain came from the reversal of a National Calamity Contingent Duty fund for one of its plants (file photo)


 The country’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer, Hero MotoCorp, on Tuesday reported a consolidated net profit of ₹1,257 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, up 36 per cent from the ₹925 crore reported in the corresponding period last year, on the back of a one-off exceptional gain of ₹737.48 crore.
However, its total income from operations fell 7 per cent from ₹9,030 crore in Q1 FY19 to ₹8,410 crore in Q1 FY20. Its EBIDTA margin for the quarter was at 14.4 per cent, improving sequentially from 13.6 per cent in Q4 FY19.
Hero MotoCorp sold 18,42,920 units of two-wheelers during the period, which is a more than 12 per cent fall year-on-year from 21,04,949 units.
The company’s board of directors has recommended a final dividend of 1,600 per cent, i.e, ₹32 per equity share of ₹2, for FY19, which was approved by the shareholders at an AGM on Monday. The total equity dividend to be paid is ₹770.5 crore (including dividend distribution tax of ₹131.37 crore), Hero MotoCorp said in a BSE filing. 
The company had earlier deposited and created a provision for ‘National Calamity Contingent Duty’ (NCCD), including the applicable cess, for its Haridwar plant while contesting it on the grounds that the NCCD is in the nature of an excise duty and should be covered by area-based exemption. Following a favourable order from the Supreme Court, the provision was reversed as an exceptional item in the latest quarter. The refund applications have already been filed, the company said. 
During the quarter, the group invested ₹12 crore in its subsidiary HMC MM Auto Ltd, taking its cumulative investment to ₹48 crore. 
“The overall economic and customer sentiments continued to be soft during the first quarter of this fiscal and their impact is clearly visible in the performance of the auto sector. The outlook for the rest of the year will be dependent on multiple factors, including the progress of the monsoon and festival season offtake, as well as improvement in liquidity,” said Hero MotoCorp CFO Niranjan Gupta. 
Given the dependence of multiple sectors and millions of jobs on the auto industry, it is imperative for the government to take urgent steps to boost consumption, he observed.
“We would, therefore, reiterate our appeal to the government to bring down the GST on two-wheelers to 18 per cent from the current level of 28 per cent. A reduction in GST will lower the cost of two-wheelers and spur demand, with the consequent growth in volumes offsetting any impact on the government revenue,” he added."

A brokerage says Hero's first-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) at ₹1,158 crore and EBITDA margin at 14.4 percent was largely in line with estimates, as a miss in gross margin was offset by low costs.
The company has posted better-than-expected 38.3 percent jump in after-tax profit helped by a one-off gain. The profit before tax and one-off gains declined 15.4 percent
The CIMB says Hero MotoCorp could be a beneficiary of easing concerns over rainfall and the government's focus on supporting rural customers.

 Leading two-wheeler manufacturers Hero MotoCorp and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI) have reported a double-digit decline in sales last month, hit by lower offtake in a sluggish market.
 The country’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp reported a 21.18 per cent dip in total sales at 5,35,810 units in July, as compared with 6,79,862 units in the year-ago period.
 “The sluggish market environment prevalent in the first quarter has continued in the beginning of the second quarter as well and its impact is visible in the dispatch volumes,” Hero MotoCorp said in a statement.
 The outlook for the rest of the year will be dependent on multiple factors, including the progress of monsoon and festive season offtake, as well as improvement in the liquidity situation, it added.
 Similarly, HMSI reported 10.77 per cent decline in total sales last month at 4,89,631 units. It had sold 5,48,751 units in July 2018."

At a time when the auto industry is going through a tough phase, the country’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer, Hero MotoCorp, in an attempt to boost sales, has started delivery of its scooters and motorcycle at the customers’ doorstep. This is being done at a nominal charge.
The company has started an e-commerce portal — www.HGPmart.com — to offer this facility, and the service is currently available in three cities —Mumbai, Bengaluru and Noida. The company plans to expand this facility to 25 cities over the next few months in a phased manner, it said in a statement on Monday. Hero MotoCorp has developed a simple procedure under which the entire process from booking to delivery is completed in three easy steps, the company said adding that customers need to pay a nominal fee of ₹349 to avail of the service. “We have been the first-mover in the e-commerce space and we are continuing this trend by commencing this new service. The motorcycle or scooter can be delivered at any address of your choice, not just at your home,” Sanjay Bhan, Head of Sales, Aftersales & Parts Business, Hero MotoCorp, said.
Hero MotoCorp has been in the e-commerce space, having partnered with an e-commerce portal to sell two-wheelers online. Last year, it pioneered the two-wheeler spare-parts’ online retail through its official portal www.HGPmart.com. Looking at its success, the company subsequently shifted the online booking of Hero products from its official company Website to this portal, which has since received nearly 4,000 bookings.
“Our new initiative will raise the bar for customer experience in the two-wheeler category. As the youth of today increasingly look for value-added services in every purchase that they make, brands have to step-up their strategic thinking to stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving market environment,” Bhan added.
The company sold 5,35,810 units of two-wheelers in July, down 21 per cent as compared with 6,79,862 units in the same month last year.
The company has developed a simple procedure under which the entire process from booking to delivery is completed in three easy steps."
8,2019-08-14,Hero MotoCorp,"Hero Motors charging up e-bicycles with ₹1,000-crore investment plan
 Hero Motors Ltd aims to be the world’s largest electric bicycle maker in the next 12 quarters, said Pankaj M Munjal, Chairman and Managing Director, Hero Motors Company (HMC). 
Hero Cycles aims to manufacture 500,000 electric bicycles by the end of FY22, with most of the line utilisation planned for exports. 
Hero Cycles is the flagship company of the HMC group and Hero Motors is one of the manufacturing units of the HMC group, which has its manufacturing plant in Ghaziabad, with a production capacity of 8,000 e-bicycles per month. Hero Motors also supplies automotive parts to various automakers. 
“Hero Cycles will be globally competitive and focussed on e-bicycles. We will be identified with e-bicycles...Our focus is on becoming global, dominant players of e-bicycles,” Munjal told BusinessLine
 Hero Cycles’ electric bicycle brand Lectro started selling in India in November 2018. “With over 35 per cent of the population still walking and over 17 per cent using two-wheelers to cover under trips under 5 km, there is a great potential to increase/ induce adoption at the price point Lectro is available at, as compared to most electric vehicles available in India. If EV as a category has to grow and achieve its overall objectives, it has to be adopted by the masses,” said Munjal.
Hero Cycles first started selling Lectro in the UK/EU, after it acquired UK-based Avocet Sports in 2015. It will continue to use the existing distribution network through Avocet Sports to export and sell Lectro in the UK/EU. 
The company is targeting a sale of 45,000 units of Lectro this year, with around 50 per cent to be exported to the UK/EU. Going forward, the company will be looking at exporting Lectro to countries other than the UK, said Munjal.
The company is planning an overall investment of ₹1,000 crore in Lectro, which would involve a phased investment directed towards strengthening its global design, R&D and its manufacturing unit in Ghaziabad. The company has plans to upgrade its manufacturing facility to support global demand, both in terms of quality and volume, said Munjal.
Munjal said that a part of the investment may also be directed towards bringing about a strong retail distribution network. The company also has plans to bring about exclusive stores for retail, though this would be at a later stage, he added. 
“We are also in the process of tying up with existing leading global technology players in the fields of motors, batteries, sensors and other e- components, enabling us to manufacture world class products,” said Munjal. 
Lectro has clocked sales of 7,000 units in India till now. The base variant is available at ₹17,850 and the high-end model at ₹25,350. The company is planning to launch another model soon which is going to be priced at approximately ₹31,000. The e-bicycles business of Hero Cycles has grown at a CAGR of 50 per cent month-on-month for the past three months, he said.
Munjal said that going by the example of Europe, the electric vehicle revolution in India can start with e-bicycles. “The inclusion of electric bicycles in EV is a strong indicator of its acceptability by the government and the expectation for its adoption by masses by incentivising and subsidies. The lower GST rate (on e-bicycles, from 12 per cent to 5 per cent) after (its) inclusion (as an EV) is also a big plus. All other electric mobility solutions (cars and bikes) are expensive as solutions and hence, electric cycles will be a strong bridge between motorised vehicles /electric cars and bikes,” said Munjal. 
Munjal said that if e-bicycles are also recognised under the government’s Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India -II (FAME- II) scheme, it would be an important move from the perspective of manufacturing and the subsidies under it would imply lower an MRP for e-bicycles."
7,2019-08-16,Hero MotoCorp,"Hero MotoCorp plants to remain shut for 4 days till Aug 18 
 The country’s largest two-wheeler maker, Hero MotoCorp, on Friday said its manufacturing plants have been shut for four days till August 18 as part of an annual routine and also to adjust production in line with the current market demand. 
In a regulatory filing, Hero MotoCorp said its manufacturing facilities will be closed from August 15 to 18, 2019.
“While this is part of the annual holiday calendar on account of Independence Day, Raksha Bandhan and the weekend, it also partly reflects the prevailing market demand scenario,” the company added. 
Hero MotoCorp further said production planning is a matter of advance monitoring of the market dynamics and prudent demand forecasting. 
“This helps us to plan our production well in advance, thereby enabling us to stay flexible both in terms of volumes and production schedules,” the company said. 
Hero MotoCorp has been reducing its production due to decline in sales. In the April-July period this year, the two-wheeler market leader’s production was at 24,66,802 units, down 12.03 per cent from the year-ago period."
6,2019-08-16,Hero MotoCorp,"Tata Motors announces another temporary shutdown; Hero, too, shuts plant for 4 days 
As an unprecedented slowdown continues to rattle the automobile sector, vehicle and components manufacturers have resorted to temporary factory closures to align production with demand. And temporary workers have begun to get pink slips.
What started as a one-off event is now becoming routine. Yet again this week, some companies, including Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and two TVS group firms have announced temporary factory closures.
Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki Chairman RC Bhargava said over 3,000 temporary employees have lost their jobs with the company. Their contracts were not renewed due to the slowdown, he said while asserting that permanent workers have not been impacted.
Hero said its manufacturing plants will be shut for four days from August 15 to 18 to align production with demand. “Production planning is a matter of advance monitoring of the market dynamics and prudent demand forecasting. This helps us to plan our production well in advance, enabling us to stay flexible both in terms of volumes and production schedules,” it said.
While this has been part of the annual holiday calendar on account of an extended weekend with Independence Day and Raksha Bandhan, it also partly reflects the prevailing demand scenario, it added.
Tata Motors appears to have announced its third factory closure of this month. The automaker is shutting its Jamshedpur unit for two days — August 16 and 17.
“The external environment remains challenging, leading to demand correction. We have aligned our production to actual demand and adjusted the number of shifts and contractual manpower,” said a Tata Motors spokesperson.
If OEMs are resorting to such measures, auto parts suppliers cannot be far behind. Chennai-based Sundaram-Clayton Ltd, a TVS group company, has declared August 16 and 17 as non-working days for its Padi plant.
Lucas-TVS, a manufacturer of auto electrical parts, has already announced two non-working days at its Padi unit on the same days in view of the slowdown in the vehicle sector. The company said it is examining the situation for further decisions.
Vehicle sales in India fell 19 per cent in July to 18.3 lakh units on the back of the economic slowdown and weak consumer sentiment. All sectors, including passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles and two-wheelers, reported a double-digit decline in sales.
Auto production also witnessed a decline of about 11 per cent at 10.88 million units in April-July 2019, against growth of about 17 per cent in the same period last year.
Large inventories of 30-45 days with dealers have forced many major manufacturers to cut production, according to analysts at CARE Ratings. With the monsoon wreaking havoc in several States, hopes for a recovery in demand in the coming months, during the festival season, have also diminished."
