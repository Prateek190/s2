Motilal Oswal
UPL (Neutral)
CMP: ₹576.9
Target: ₹630
 UPL’s revenue (including Arysta) rose 91 per cent y-o-y to ₹7,910 crore (our estimate: ₹8,190 crore) in Q1 FY20. However, on a like-to-like basis (i.e., including Arysta in Q1 FY19), revenue was up 7 per cent y-o-y (volume growth: 5 per cent, price growth: 1 per cent and exchange gain: 1 per cent). Reported EBITDA was up 47 per cent y-o-y to ₹1,250 crore (our estimate: ₹18b; +11 per cent y-o-y on a like-to-like basis). Adjusted PAT declined 13 per cent y-o-y to ₹4.9b (our estimate: ₹810 crore).
Key concall takeaways: i) Maintained guidance of 8-10 per cent revenue growth and 16-20 per cent EBITDA growth for FY20; ii) Debt increased by ₹795 crore q-o-q due to $90 million payout on account of increased working capital in Arysta and $13-14 million payout for Biopen, an acquisition in Costa Rica.
Valuation view: We cut our earnings estimate by 2 per cent/9 per cent for FY20/21 to factor in higher depreciation and interest cost. High debt remains a key concern owing to the Arysta acquisition (significant rise in net D/E from 0.4x in FY18 to 1.8x in FY19). We value the stock at 14x FY21E EPS (about 10 per cent discount to its five-year average trading multiple, mainly due to its highly leveraged balance sheet). Our target price of ₹630 implies a 6 per cent upside."
1,2019-10-01,Phosphorus Limited,"UPL (₹603.7): Buy 
Investors with a shot-term view can buy the stock of UPL at current levels. The stock surged 3.7 per cent accompanied by above average volume on Monday, breaking above a key immediate resistance at ₹587 as well as the 200-day moving average. Moreover, the stock has decisively breached its 21- and 50-day moving averages and hovers well above them. This reinforces the short-term uptrend.
Following a sharp fall in July and early August this year, the stock took support at ₹500 and changed direction triggered by positive divergence in the daily relative strength index. Since then the stock has been in a short-term uptrend.
The daily relative strength index has entered the bullish zone from the neutral region and the weekly RSI hovers in the neutral region with an upward bias. Both the daily and the weekly price rate of change indicators feature in the positive terrain implying buying interest.
The short-term outlook is bullish. The stock can extend the uptrend and knock the price targets of ₹627 and ₹640 in the short term. Traders can buy the stock with a stop-loss at ₹591.
