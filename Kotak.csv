52,2018-01-09,Kotak,"Rs 15 cr bank deposits made post note ban declared benami
Cash deposits of Rs 15.93 crore made in a Delhi bank post demonetisation have been held as ’benami’ property by a special court even as the depositor and the beneficial owner of the stash are “untraceable“.
The deposits were declared ‘benami’ in the ruling in one of the first adjudication cases of the new anti-black money law.
The Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government had brought into force the new Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016, from November 1 last year, as part of its multi-pronged strategy to curb illicit wealth.
The case pertains to one Ramesh Chand Sharma, reportedly a resident of Gali Laltain in Naya Bazar area of old Delhi.
The Income Tax Department, as part of its drive against black funds post the note ban, had conducted a survey at the Kotak Mahindra Bank branch on K G Marg in December last year and found that Sharma, post demonetisation, deposited Rs 15,93,39,136 cash in old notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 in the account of three firms, suspected to be fake.
The taxman found that immediately after the cash deposits were made, “demand drafts were issued to a group of non- descript individuals with a view to alienate the cash.”
The department froze these DDs and attached these funds calling them ‘benami’
The department subsequently sent the order for confirmation to the Adjudicating Authority of the Act, as per the legal provision of this stringent law.
The Authority, sometime back, confirmed the I-T order, making it one of the first five cases of adjudication under this new law in the country till now.
“The material gathered through the survey, search, consequent enquiry clearly leaves no room to doubt that the said amount aggregating to Rs 15.93 crore (approx) in accounts of...is a benami property. The said Ramesh Chand Sharma is the benamidar and the identity of the beneficial owner is not known,” an order by the division bench of the Authority, Mukesh Kumar (Chairperson) and Tushar V Shah (Member-Law), said.
The order, accessed by PTI, said Sharma too has been “untraceable” since the action was launched against him by the I-T Department.
It added that Sharma “consistently remained absent in the proceedings before the investigating officer and also before the Authority in spite of several services (summonses) in accordance with law.”
The tax department’s charge sheet filed in the case states field enquiries revealed that Sharma was “holding this benami property (cash deposits) as a benamidar for some persons who are the beneficial owners of the properties and whose identity is not traceable or is fictitious.”
The department also found that Sharma has once filed an Income Tax Return (ITR) declaring income of Rs 3 lakh for the assessment year 2006-07.
Sharma, as per the I-T charge sheet, never responded to its summonses and his address given in the KYC (know your customer) documents of the bank “resulted in the revelation that no such person ever resided” in the given location of old Delhi.
“Enquiry by the Inspector revealed that nothing was known about such person in the neighbourhood also,” it said.
“The only possible reason for giving a wrong address could be that there was a pre-planned intention on the part of the account holder (Sharma) to engage in such activities after which he did not want any trace of his to be left behind.
“Apparently, his account was utilised by persons who were either not traceable or fictitious to bring their own unaccounted money in the form of demonetisation currency notes back into the banking channel,” the I-T charge sheet, also called prosecution complaint, said.
It added that no one claimed the money even after the taxman attached it as it was black and the person(s) concerned “decided to remain quiet and forego the amount rather than to reveal themselves to the law.”
“It is apparent that Sharma, a man of meagre means could not have the resources to raise such a huge amount,” it said.
After PM Modi’s declaration of the note ban on November 8 last year, the I-T department had warned people against depositing their unaccounted banknotes in accounts maintained by someone else.
Such an act, it had said, would attract criminal charges under the Benami Act, applicable on both movable and immovable properties.
The I-T department is the nodal department to enforce the Benami Act in the country.
The tax department, in a data updated till last month, had said that assets worth Rs 1,833 crore have been attached by it under this stringent new law, for which it issued over 517 notices and made 541 attachments.
The law provides for a maximum punishment of seven years in jail and a fine."

Shanti Ekambaram, President, Kotak Mahindra Bank




Shanti Ekambaram, President, Kotak Mahindra Bank


There is nothing called an unearthly hour when it comes to opening a bank account. This seems to the experience of Kotak Mahindra Bank. Customers are opening online ‘811’ savings deposit accounts from the comfort of their homes even in the wee hours, says Shanti Ekambaram, the bank’s President (Consumer Banking).
She underscored that her bank is experiencing tailwind in the opening of new deposit accounts (across channels — online as well as offline), with the number of accounts added in the first two quarters of FY18 being almost three times the number added in the year-ago period.
In the first two quarters of the current financial year, the private sector bank added 2.5 million accounts. As at September-end 2017, its customer base increased to 10.5 million.
“Obviously, ‘811’ has helped us (expand the customer base). It has given the customer a tool to open a banking account anytime….
“There is a lot of activity (account opening) post 7 pm and right up to 4 am because you can just sit in the comfort of your home and open an account in about two-three minutes (on an average),” said Ekambaram.
Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) had launched the ‘811 account’ on March 29, 2017. It is a online savings account that can be opened by downloading the bank’s app and authenticating oneself with Aadhaar credentials via a one-time password.
The account offers a zero-balance savings account with zero-charges for all digital transactions, where customers can earn 5 per cent on savings account balance up to ₹1 lakh; 6 per cent on balances above ₹1 lakh and up to ₹1 crore.
“It (811) has given a great fillip to our (customer) acquisition strategy. And we are getting customers from all walks of life.
“Roughly about 50 per cent of the customers who have come through this (811) route are from the salaried category. The remaining are professionals (self-employed), retired people, housewives, students, etc,” explained Ekambaram.
After the introduction of 811, the bank’s savings account (SA) deposits as a percentage of total deposits improved to 32.28 per cent as at September-end 2017 from 26.36 per cent as at March-end 2017.
Ekambaram said once the amalgamation of ING Vysya Bank with KMB was completed around September last year, on the consumer side KMB doubled the number of branches, doubled the base of customers, and there was a great opportunity to cross-sell into the bank’s network.
Now, 55-60 per cent of the bank’s incremental business (loan) comes through the branch network and the balance via the direct marketing side. The top KMB official pointed out that incremental business from the branch network was around 40 per cent about two years ago."

Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a 20 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in standalone third quarter net profit at ₹1,053 crore against ₹880 crore in the year-ago quarter.
Net interest income (difference between interest earned and interest expended) was up 17 per cent to ₹2,394 crore.
Other income (including fee and services and others) increased 14 per cent to ₹1,040 crore.

49,2018-02-20,Kotak,"Growth has been satisfactory across all products: Kotak Mahindra Life MD


G MURLIDHAR, MD & CEO, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance Company




G MURLIDHAR, MD & CEO, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance Company


It’s the busiest period of the year for life insurance companies as sales teams try to push their products. Historically, most of the sales of life policies are done during the last few weeks of the fiscal — partly for tax purposes and, of course, the pressure to achieve targets.
Like many other CEOs, G Murlidhar, MD and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance Company, says to his team often, “Keep the faith and be at it.”
That, he says, is done to reiterate the message that the life insurance business is a marathon and not a sprint. His team certainly appears to have taken that to heart and delivered the numbers needed. Premium income for the current year is expected to cross ₹6,500 crore, a growth of nearly 27 per cent over the previous year.
Up to December 2017, individual new business premium grew 38 per cent while renewal premiums grew 27 per cent. The company, which is the seventh largest among the 25-player life insurance industry, has been consistently growing faster than the market during the past few years.
The growth for the company has been satisfactory across all products, Murlidhar said, adding that about 35 per cent of the premium comes from ULIP products while another 60 per cent from traditional products. He said that the company would strive to broadly retain this balance in the coming years with perhaps a slightly higher emphasis on traditional products.
Individual premiums have contributed about 48 per cent and group business 43 per cent of the premium so far this year.
Murlidhar said that the company was looking at growth from both agency and bancassurance channels.
About 35 per cent of business comes from individual agents while about 55 per cent comes from corporate agents (principally banks). And about half of that is through its parent — Kotak Mahindra Bank.
The recurring theme in Murlidhar’s conversation is the need for ‘balance’ in all ways — whether it is in the way the income is earned or spent — and which, he is quick to emphasise, doesn’t come by accident but due to careful planning.
There is constant monitoring to see that there is no risk of being ‘overweight’ on a particular channel or product. The focus on quality has also resulted in improved persistency ratios for its policy sales. The 13th month persistency ratio which was around 66 per cent in 2013 is around 82 per cent now and the effort now is to increase this further.
Asked about the possibility of going for a public offer and listing as some of its competitors have done, Murlidhar makes clear that for the company there is no requirement for capital right now. The solvency ratio is twice the 150 per cent required by regulators. “It is a call for the shareholders to take,” is how he puts it.
Asked about consolidation in the industry and whether the company would be looking at some acquisitions, Murlidhar laughs away the query."

   -  SHASHI ASHIWAL


Private sector banks’ market share will go up significantly and be on a par with that of public sector banks in the next five years, according to Uday Kotak, Executive Vice-Chairman and Managing Director, Kotak Mahindra Bank.
The top banker’s observations come in the backdrop of public sector banks reeling under bad loans. Huge provisioning due to this could constrain their ability to lend, say experts.
“If you look at the numbers, for example, on a delta basis, nearly the entire growth in loans is happening in private sector banking, whose share is growing pretty significantly.
“I am happy to make a statement that in the next five years, the 70:30 ratio will move towards 50:50. This major mega trend in the redefinition of the industry structure is something which is playing out as we talk,” said Kotak.
Replying to a specific question from Nandan Nilekani, Co-founder and Non-Executive Chairman of Infosys, on the recent happenings in banks, “LoUs and what not”, Kotak said: “Indian banking is going through one of the significant challenges as we talk. In the banking business, you must have a focussed approach to ensure that the money you give out comes back.”
“Banking is fundamentally a high-risk business. For example, out of a ₹100 loan given, a bank’s equity is only ₹10, the balance is depositors’ money.”
Kotak elaborated that banking is one single business where errors of commission are far more expensive than errors of omission.
“And in that kind of a business, you have to have fundamental quality of prudence, simplicity, etc., or else this is one of the most difficult businesses in the world,” he said.
Kotak explained that banks and borrowers went into a bout of exuberance with banks putting out a lot of money in 2006-2010 with very questionable underwriting.
Evergreening
“And then between the period 2010-11 till 2018, I think, the game of basically postponing without recognising (bad loans) effectively bloated the loans to disproportionately high levels because we were accumulating the interest (banks were effectively evergreening).
“So, what was originally a ₹100 loan in 2011 has become a ₹200 or ₹250 loan today and this just kept on bloating for a period of seven or eight years. So, we are here now with a huge bloat. And at this stage I am embarrassed to say that we are amongst the top three countries in the world when it comes to levels of stress; and who are our companions — Greece and Italy,” said the Kotak Bank chief.
With the recent fraud coming to light, banking is (to put it in cricket terminology), becoming a tricky wicket, Kotak said, adding that the whole narrative of Indian finance is under a significant catharsis.
SME business
“At this stage, the belief is that a lot of the challenges in the banking system are essentially on the large businesses. I think, we have also a pretty sensitive underbelly of the SMEs business, which has not fully revealed its hand yet,” Kotak said.
“And the underwriting standards in that will also come up for questioning as we go down this path of much faster (loan default) disclosure being required by the RBI. This (revised framework for resolution of stressed assets) will have its implications not only for the big guys but also for the SME sector.”"

DEEPAK SHARMA, Chief Digital Officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank




DEEPAK SHARMA, Chief Digital Officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank


Digitisation has been closely aligned with Kotak Mahindra Bank’s core strategy. In an interview to BusinessLine, Deepak Sharma, Chief Digital Officer, explains how the private sector bank has benefited by adopting digital initiatives and how it has helped customers transact in a transparent manner. Excerpts:
How has Kotak Mahindra Bank’s digital journey panned out so far?
Digital is closely aligned with Kotak’s core strategy and our digital initiatives are focussed on customer and revenue growth, efficiency, customer experience, digital payments, risk management, security innovation and future readiness.
Various tech initiatives and transformation projects are directed towards this.
How much of Kotak Bank’s revenues come from the digital channel and what are the expenses involved?
The bank’s digital channel works as a horizontal layer, thereby creating value for different customer segments and business verticals. While some are direct revenue, cost and efficiency initiatives, others are linked to innovation, security and customer experience.
We track and measure the impact of the initiatives across various parameters which are not necessarily cost and revenue centric.
Most recently, we concluded our maiden payment co-creation programme, where we selected six innovative companies from over 130 entries that we received to work with us in the digital payments space for different segments like SME, modern trade, consumers and rural customers.
The twin objectives of this Kotak Payment Co-creation Programme are to provide an impetus to fintech-bank partnerships and build an ecosystem of collaboration and innovation for start-ups and fintechs in the digital payments space.
What is the time taken for conversion of customers from physical to digital mode?
We saw early success due to the rich features in our mobile banking app, which has over 100 features like banking, payments, shopping, loans, investments, etc.
By educating and on-boarding customers early on to our digital channels, we have seen higher adoption levels, greater engagement and higher number and value of transactions.
As of now, over two-thirds of our customers are digitally active, our log-in frequency is amongst the highest in the industry, and with a 2 per cent share of India’s deposits, we command around 8 per cent of India’s mobile banking transaction value.
What is the level of digitisation now, and what is the target set by the bank?
Kotak Mahindra Bank last week announced its digital-first organic growth strategy that will be driven by its ABCD charter — AI-enriched app; biometric-enabled branch; context enhanced customer experience; and data empowered design.
Our focus is to digitise all processes and make them paperless, frictionless using straight-through processing. Some of our initiatives, such as biometric-based account opening, API-based paperless processing of service requests and robotic process automation are all a part of this journey.
We continue to leverage technology like API, Artificial Intelligence, cognitive OCR, machine learning, design thinking, and data science and analytics to make progress on a transformation journey, wherein over the next couple of years the majority of processes at the consumer bank shall become paperless and straight-through processing.
How much more profitable are digital customers as compared to those who need physical assistance?
A majority of our digitally -ctive customers are omni-channel customers. Such customers are highly engaged and we see higher product holdings and relationship value with such customers.
What has been the bank’s innovations and its engagement with industry bodies like Nasscom?
We started the Kotak Innovation Lab and Fintech partnership programme early on to focus on future tech and value creation. We have completed over 100 POC (proof of concept) and onboarded over 60 fintechs to work with us in areas like lending, robotic automation, payments, artificial intelligence, customer experience and blockchain, among others.
We have also partnered with various accelerators, innovation hubs and VC firms in this process. We have partnered with the Nasscom 10,000 Startups initiative to support and co-create solutions which are relevant for India."

NARAYAN SA, President-Commercial Banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank




NARAYAN SA, President-Commercial Banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank


Narayan SA, President-Commercial Banking, at Kotak Mahindra Bank, believes the government’s decision to increase minimum support price (MSP) of crops is good news for rural India, and it would give a push to rural demand. Narayan, who oversees agri business, tractor and commercial vehicles/construction equipment finance, and emerging corporate group businesses of the bank, shared his views with BusinessLine on a slew of issues. Excerpts:
Does the new minimum support price (MSP) of at least one-and-a-half times the cost of production for all rabi and kharif crops augur well for the rural economy? Will it be inflationary?
The decision to increase MSP to at least one-and-a-half times the cost of production is a welcome move. It augurs well for rural India, making more money available to farmers. This, in turn, will help boost rural demand. Higher MSP will push up the cost and may have a modest impact on inflation. The extent of impact depends on the formula that the government will use to determine the MSP.
Outstanding non-food bank credit stands at ₹82.11 lakh crore and food credit at ₹52,300 crore as on February 2. Do you expect this trend to continue in the next financial year?
With the stabilisation of GST, we expect uptake of credit in FY 2018-19. We have witnessed credit upswing in the services sector and anticipate demand to come from the manufacturing sector on the back of expected nominal GDP growth of 11-12 per cent.
Commodity prices have become volatile much like the financial markets. Where is the commodities market headed?
Agri-commodity prices have been volatile during 2017-18, with volatility ranging from 10-30 per cent, which made it challenging for agri-processors and traders to manage their business. We expect agri-commodity prices to be less volatile in FY 2018-19. Of course, my view is based on the expectation of a reasonably good monsoon.
Growth of commercial vehicles touched an eight-year high in December 2017. Has the tide finally turned positive for the CV market?
We have witnessed a good year-on-year growth in the commercial vehicles segment from December 2017 to March 2018. At Kotak, our disbursements in the sector have increased significantly this year, and our share of the pie has grown in the heavy, medium and light commercial vehicle sectors. Currently, there are about 7 million commercial vehicles on the road, and replacement demand itself contributes substantially to fresh demand every year. Besides, the government’s focus on infrastructure and better connectivity will create additional demand for vehicles.
We expect the sector to grow at 10 per cent next year as well. At Kotak, we are confident of increasing our share by growing more than the market. We have been in the CV segment for long, and so, have built up deep relationships in this business and sound ground-level knowledge. Post-2011-12, we reduced our disbursement, since we believed that things may not pan out well. But in the last two years, we have gone in aggressively into the segment.
What are your views on the Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund with a corpus of ₹2,000 crore? Will it help bring about a structural reform in agriculture markets?
The Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund is a good concept, and will link about 22,000 rural markets to the electronic national agricultural market platform. It will enhance efficiency and ensure better remuneration for farmers. It will, over a period, bring about a structural reform in the markets. The efficiencies following the linkage will eventually result in lowering the inflation.
However, there are issues even now affecting the farmers. There are various reasons for that, such as the number of agri-commodities being so large in India, making it difficult to manage; then there is standardisation, which is a challenge. But we believe that over the next three-five years, these issues should get sorted out. We should give credit to the government for this effort.
Post-demonetisation, the SME sector was the worst hit. Are you seeing a revival in this sector? How will it shape up in the next 12-18 months? Has GST impacted lending to SMEs? Has there been any change in the borrowing pattern? What does your SME book look like? How much growth are you expecting this financial year?
Post-demonetisation and the introduction of GST, the SME sector was impacted the most. There were teething issues immediately after the GST was rolled out, but these are now easing out. We witnessed some stress during 2017-18 in the SME books, which is now showing signs of stabilisation.
Now that GST is on the stabilisation track, the SME industry is transitioning towards the formal and organised sector. We are now seeing the formal SME gaining market share and investing for growth, resulting in demand for additional financing. We are already seeing some of the State-level SME players transforming into regional/national players after GST.
We are looking forward to a robust growth of our SME book during 2018-19. This year we are bullish because all disruptions [positive though] are over. Also, from the lending point of bank, we as a bank, are able to get better information, thanks to initiatives such as GST. We expect to grow above the nominal GDP number of 11-12 per cent. However, resolution of the NPAs need to be speeded up.
At the urban retail banking side, digital banking has captured everyone’s attention — both players and consumers. Are you using digital platform for your SME and agri clients?
Digital has become an important channel in staying connected with customers and offering seamless and quick services. We work with our SME clients on a continuous basis to offer innovative and digital products and value-added offerings. We have introduced cash management system, online banking and online uploading of data, to make the banking experience more enriching and also to improve the efficiency of our clients. Recently, we rolled out the Kotak GST platform, which facilitates them to file quarterly and annual returns and get consolidated reports.
The MFI sector has seen consolidation in the last couple of years, and with the growing interest of banks in it, do you see a significant change emerging in the sector? Kotak Mahindra Bank acquired BSS Micro Finance about 18 months back. Could you share with us your post-acquisition experience?
Microfinance institutions [MFIs] have seen consolidation in the last few months. Many of the mid-sized MFIs have become small finance banks, and some of them have been taken over by existing commercial private banks. The good part of microfinance lending is it makes both commercial and social sense. It helps the overall social cause of the country by making finance available to the lower strata of society.
We acquired BSS Microfinance Private Limited last year, and its financial closure took place in September 2017. Our experience so far has been good.
Our BSS-sourced microfinance book has grown by 50 per cent this year, and is expected to further grow by 50 per cent in FY 2018-19. We are also looking at expanding BSS’ footprint, which has so far been present in Karnataka and parts of Maharashtra, by setting up offices in other States, including Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu."

Nomura says it is a an opportune time for Kotak since Axis Bank has ramped up the NPA recognition process and majority of the bad news is now known.




Nomura says it is a an opportune time for Kotak since Axis Bank has ramped up the NPA recognition process and majority of the bad news is now known.


The time is ripe for Kotak Mahindra Bank to buy Axis Bank, says a report by brokerage firm Nomura Financial Advisory Services. 
On Wednesday, Axis Bank shares were trading down 1.59 per cent at Rs 537.30 after hitting a high of Rs 552 and a low of Rs 534.10 on the BSE in a negative market.  Kotak Bank shares were trading 0.38 per cent or Rs 4.20 higher at Rs 1,117.80 on the BSE at about 12 pm.
The brokerage’s call comes in the wake of Axis Bank CEO Shikha Sharma deciding to cut her tenure to the end of this year.  Sharma was appointed at Axis Bank in June 2009 by then Chairman PJ Nayak. On Monday, the bank in a filing to the bourses, announced that she has decided to cut down her fourth term and quit on December 31, 2018.
“With a very short time left in the CEO’s term at Axis Bank, RBI’s pressure on Axis Bank’s management and with an asset quality clean-up exercise continuing, we believe this is the best opportunity for Kotak Bank to acquire or merge with Axis Bank,” the brokerage said.
A likely deal between Kotak and Axis will make the combined entity the second largest private bank in the country in terms of loans and the largest in terms of branches. 
""Our assessment suggests that Axis Bank will have to look for an external CEO. We believe this presents a great opportunity for Kotak Mahindra Bank to buy Axis Bank, which has got one of the largest liability/retail asset franchises,"" it said in a research report.
""From Axis Bank’s perspective, we believe there will be limited push-back this time for any merger, given the loss of confidence that the regulator has expressed by not approving the renewal of the CEO’s term and a vacuum in top management,"" Nomura said.
Nomura said that it was an opportune time for Kotak since Axis Bank had ramped up on the NPA recognition process and the majority of the bad news was now known. ""Since the time of the last merger talks, Kotak Bank’s stock has outperformed Axis Bank’s by 30 per cent, making the acquisition more reasonable,"" it said.
“In case of M&A, the deal would be highly earnings per share-accretive for Kotak Bank even after paying a meaningful premium to Axis Bank shareholders,” the brokerage added.
Nomura also said Kotak Bank would gain liability and retail asset size enough to rub shoulders with HDFC Bank. Importantly from the promoter’s perspective, the acquisition should help in diluting the promoter’s stake down to the requirements stipulated by the RBI. The RBI requires promoters of private banks to bring down their holding to 15 per cent within 12 years of commencement of operations. The central bank has allowed Kotak Bank’s promoter Uday Kotak to bring down his holding in the bank to 15 per cent by March 2020. Uday Kotak and his family currently hold 30.06 per cent stake in the company.

Sound risk management and governance by the state, the regulator and banks are crucial to ensure that further defaults do not take place in the banking sector, believes Uday Kotak, Managing Director, Kotak Mahindra Bank.
“As reflected by events around us, it is naïve for policy makers to believe that diversified ownership or state ownership is the way to good governance in banking. Banks deal with other people’s money,” he said in a letter to shareholders as part of the lender’s annual report, adding that the main challenge is that directors and managers with no skin in the game are taking decisions on lending and writing off thousands of crores.
“Sound principles of corporate governance and harmonious functioning between government and regulators are the crucial elements for a sound future of banking,” he noted.
Stressing that bankers must imbibe prudence, simplicity and humility in their dealings, he said that conduct is the key to the future.
Kotak remained optimistic and said heightened provisions by banks seem to be a short-term phenomenon at present, one that will be spread out in the next few quarters.
Though banks are going through turbulent times, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is a “silver lining” and a “game changer”, he said.
“It has changed the game from debtor in possession to creditor in possession in case of defaults,” he said.
Outlining the plans for the current fiscal, Kotak said that all business metrics, including loan growth, quality of loan book and the overall parameters in the private sector lender’s core banking business – insurance, wealth management, securities, asset management – and the overall financial services franchise, are well-positioned.
The bank is also on course to achieve the customer base target of 1.6 crore by September 2018, he further said.
He also predicted three trends in the country’s financial services sector, which include subdued growth at public sector banks due to stressed asset growth and capital crunch.
“Over the next five years, private sector banks will increase their industry share from 30 per cent to 50 per cent,” he said."

Indian banks may be investing heavily to ramp up their digital offerings, but most of them are still behind global benchmarks when it comes to their online banking website, according to a survey by market research firm Forrester.
The report said that ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank deliver good online banking functionality and user experience, but other Indian banks are way behind. Poor or missing functionality, weak search, navigation, and error-handling capabilities mean they fail to meet customers’ expectations at times. “Forty-two per cent of Indian online banking customers use branches because some banking activities can only be performed in person. For example, disputing a fraudulent transaction still requires customers to submit paper forms at a branch.
“There is a clear need to improve online banking capabilities to offer more comprehensive, innovative, and enhanced banking features that meet customers’ evolving needs,” the research firm said in its report, The Forrester Banking Wave: Indian Online Banking Websites, Q3 2018.
“Unfortunately, our reviews found that many experiences miss the mark. Indian banks have prioritised investments in mobile banking apps, neglecting online banking and putting future business growth at risk by failing to design services that meet the changing needs of their customers,” it added.
The study is based on detailed analysis of 50 functionality and 30 user experience criteria.
Privacy and security
On security and privacy, the report said that aside from HDFC Bank, most of the banks it reviewed do a poor job of educating customers on security topics such as online fraud.
Self-service features that let customers initiate or complete requests without having to interact with a bank employee are becoming important.
“To boost trust, banks must offer the ability to dispute a transaction, especially in the face of rising electronic transaction fraud. The banks we reviewed in this report fail to fully adhere to the RBI’s guidelines on limiting customers’ liability for unauthorised electronic banking transactions.”"

 Kotak Mahindra Bank will raise up to Rs 500 crore by issuing preference shares on a private placement basis.
 The Non-Convertible Preference Shares (NCPS) Issuance Committee of the board of directors of the bank today resolved to approved the issue of perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (PNCPS) on a private placement basis aggregating to an issue size of up to Rs 500 crore, Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a regulatory filing.
 The PNCPS will offer the allottees a fixed dividend of 8.10 per cent.
 The funds are to be utilised to boost the capital under Basel III norms which are to be adopted fully by Indian banks by March 2019.
 As per the norms, banks are required to shore up their capital adequacy ratios and maintain equity capital at 7 per cent of risk-weighted assets.
 Being implemented in phases since April 1, 2013, India is expected to fully implement Basel III standards by March 2019, three months later than the globally accepted deadline.
 Although banks in India have higher capital adequacy ratio than the minimum total capital requirement under Basel III, their Tier-I or equity capital needs to be shored up to meet the norm."

 Uday Kotak, the founder and promoter of Kotak Mahindra Bank, has pared his stake in the bank to 19.70 per cent from about 30 per cent following issuance of preference shares. The stake dilution of the promoter is in line with RBI’s directive. 
The bank has “approved the allotment of 100,00,00,000 Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) to eligible investors at the issue price of Rs 5 per PNCPS, aggregating to Rs 500 crore pursuant to the issue,” Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a BSE filing.
Subsequent to this issue, the paid-up capital of the bank has increased from Rs 953.16 crore to Rs 1,453.16 crore and the promoter holding is 19.70 per cent of the paid-up capital, it said. Kotak’s holding in the bank prior to the preference share issuance was 29.74 per cent.
The preference shares have been issued through private placement. The promoters’ position in terms of voting rights will remain the same as earlier as banking laws cap voting rights at 15 per cent, irrespective of shareholding. 
RBI had earlier asked promoters of Kotak Mahindra Bank to bring down their stake to 20 per cent by December 2018 and 15 per cent by March 2020 in line with the guidelines for new bank licences released four years ago.
 Kotak had previously sold his stake in May last year. He sold 1.8 crore shares of the bank for a little over Rs 1,687 crore, resulting in dilution of his stake to 29.74 per cent."

The Reserve Bank of India has rejected Kotak Mahindra Bank’s move to dilute promoter shareholding by allotting preferential shares.
“The RBI communicated to us today that our perpetual non-cumulative preference shares issuance does not meet their promoter holding dilution requirement,” Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a regulatory filing. “We continue to believe that we have met the requirement and will engage with the RBI in this behalf,” it added. Sources said the bank may have to look for other ways to dilute the promoter holding.
Kotak Mahindra Bank had, on August 2, issued non-convertible PNCPS on private placement basis to raise ₹500 crore, following which its paid-up capital had increased to ₹1,453.16 crore from ₹953.16 crore. Industry experts had seen it as a novel experiment to pare the stake of the lender’s founder and promoter Uday Kotak to 19.70 per cent from 29.74 per cent. The move had, however, raised eyebrows as preference shares do not enjoy voting rights.
The RBI had mandated the bank to lower the promoter holding to less than 20 per cent by December 2018, and 15 per cent by March 2020.
Though the preference share allotment met the regulatory requirement and experts did not see anything legally wrong with it, there were questions on whether it was the right way to do it."

Uday Kotak




Veteran banker and CII President-designate Uday Kotak, on Friday, underlined the need for an integrated regulatory framework, as the financial sector moves towards an issuer-investor model from the saver-borrower model.
“India is at the crossroads between the bank-led model and intermediation-led model under investor-issuer mechanism, where leverage is becoming infinite, rising risk levels 24x7,” he said at the 9th Financial Markets Summit, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry .
The integration of both these models in the market was imminent, he further said.
“This is an important transition period where the dramatic need for close integration between both these parts is crucial,” he added.
Kotak, who is the Managing Director and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank, also noted that earlier the bulk of intermediation happened through banks or the saver-borrower model, where people saved and deposited their money, which, in turn, was lent by banks with all the checks and balances.
But today, there is a significant transition underway, where the saver-borrower model is getting replaced by an issuer-investor model, both in equity as well as in debt markets, he noted.
He also called for a similar move on the regulatory front and despite the emerging trend of issuer-investor model, regulations are still rooted in the older saver-borrower model.
“Some of the challenges of the transition between the two models are that many entities may be regulated by the format, which is normal for the saver-borrower model, but bulk of its liabilities is in the issuer-investor model,” he said. This, he noted, is especially the case in NBFCs, where regulation is in the traditional regulatory framework, but bulk of their money comes from markets such as mutual funds, insurers and debt papers."

 The Bombay High Court on Monday declined Kotak Mahindra Bank’s plea for a stay on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s December 31 deadline to reduce its promoter stake holding.
This, in effect, would mean that the private sector lender has a little more than 10 days to lower its promoter stake from close to 30 per cent to 20 per cent without facing penalties from the RBI.
The division bench of Justices BP Dharmadhikari and SV Kotwal has directed the RBI to file an affidavit by January 17 on the writ petition filed by the bank against the directive.
In September, the RBI had withdrawn permission to Bandhan Bank to open new branches and had put a freeze on the remuneration of its MD and CEO CS Ghosh after it failed to lower its promoter holding to 40 per cent, to conform with the licensing norms for a universal bank. 
On December 10, Kotak Mahindra Bank had filed a writ petition with the Bombay High Court on the Banking Regulation Act and had sought validation on whether its issuance of Perpetual Non-Convertible Preference Shares (PNCPS) in August met the RBI’s requirements for promoters to lower the ir stake holding.
The RBI had earlier clarified that this did not meet its requirment to lower the promoter holding. It had conveyed this to the bank in August.
As of September 30, the promoter group held a 30.02 per cent stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank, of which, Uday Kotak, Managing Director and CEO, held 29.73 per cent.
Kotak Mahindra Bank’s counsel Darius Khambata on Monday argued before the Court that the issue of dilution of promoter stakes has been going on for a few years and the bank had written two letters to the RBI — one on September 4 and the other on September 24 — seeking clarification.
“However, there has been no reply till date. All that we are now seeking is for the new RBI governor to consider the matter afresh. Until then the deadline of December 31 may be extended for a month,” Khambata pleaded. Appearing for the RBI, senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond and advocate Parag Sharma opposed the plea, pointing out that the reason behind asking for promoter stake dilution is to ensure that voting power is not in the hands of a single group. 
Experts and bankers noted this is the first time any bank has moved court against the regulator. “It is unlikely that the issue will be taken lightly,” said a banker, who did not wish to be named.
“If Uday Kotak and the bank do not comply with the norms by December 31, the RBI must levy penalties similar to those imposed on other banks,” said independent analyst Hemindra Hazari.
Kotak Mahindra shares fell 2.5 per cent on the BSE and closed at ₹1,223.90 apiece.

 Billionaire Uday Kotak, promoter and head of Kotak Mahindra Bank, may be running out of time in complying with the RBI’s shareholding guidelines. 
With just two days left for Kotak to cut his stake worth around $3 billion in the bank, legal experts say the lender could face RBI action similar to what Bandhan Bank saw in September.
Under shareholding norms, Kotak is required to cut his holding to 20 per cent from the current 30 per cent by December 31, and to 15 per cent by March 2020. 
Legal and corporate governance experts say Kotak’s non-compliance could expose minority shareholders to the risk of regulatory punishment. 
In September, for similar shareholding violations, the RBI froze the salary of Bandhan Bank founder and CEO Chandra Shekhar Ghosh and denied the bank permission to open new branches.
In August, Kotak sold ₹100 crore worth of non-convertible preference shares to a few domestic institutions and claimed a reduction in promoter holding to 19.70 per cent. 
The RBI did not approve of this method, following which the bank filed an appeal with the Bombay High Court challenging its decision. 
The High Court, earlier this month, refused to grant any interim relief to Kotak Bank. 
When contacted, Rohit Rao, Chief Communication Officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said: “The bank believes it is compliant with RBI’s promoter dilution communication. 
The RBI has not accepted the bank’s contention. The matter is sub-judice, hence the bank cannot offer any comments on this.” 
The RBI had reprimanded Kotak in 2007, too, for not meeting the deadline to cut his stake to 30 per cent from 49 per cent. 
It had then instructed Kotak Bank to draw up a plan under shareholding guidelines for private banks to reduce the promoter holding to 10 per cent. 
Kotak’s petition shows there were over 30 letters, e-mails and other forms of correspondence between the bank and the RBI, including several seeking deadline extensions.
“It is unprecedented for Kotak Bank to sue RBI . On earlier occasions, the promoter complied with the norms but the current situation leaves minority shareholders unnecessarily exposed to regulatory punishments/restrictions on Kotak Bank for no fault of theirs,” said Anil Singhvi, Chairman, ICAN Investments Advisors. 
Banking sources told BusinessLine the RBI is likely to choose to wait for the final High Court judgment in the matter although there is no stay on any action by the regulator. 
The next hearing in the case is scheduled for January 17."

It is “dil maangey more” (the heart yearns for more) for Uday Kotak, MD and CEO, Kotak Mahindra Bank, when it comes to India’s growth. He feels India is capable of clocking 9-10 per cent growth. Kotak, who is one of India’s ace bankers, says that if the country has to reach where China is today, it has to grow at 9 per cent per annum for the next 20 years. 
In the recent backdrop of corporate governance issues cropping up in the banking sector (read: quid pro quo in giving loans), Kotak observes that banks should have a team that has strong middle-class values and won’t let growth and success go into its head. 
In an interaction with BusinessLine, Kotak said banking is the most dangerous and toughest of all businesses. Excerpts:
What more could have been done by way of reforms in the banking sector in the past 25 years?
Banking and finance are the backbone of India’s economic growth. When we look back 25 years, 1992-1993 was a very crucial moment when India actually took a turn towards reform. We unleashed reforms in the financial sector such as opening up the mutual fund industry, insurance, collapse and then development of the NBFC sector, and the end of development financial institutions as we knew them. A fair amount of reform has happened in broadening the financial sector.
Over the last 25 years, we could have significantly improved the fundamentals of banking. By this, I mean the whole challenge in banking is the challenge of agency, which is banking other people’s money. And how do we build a system that takes care of other people’s money as if it is our own? This is one of the biggest issues in the banking industry which is very highly leveraged, and small mistakes cost a lot.
At some level, this is not just an Indian problem, but a global one. The global financial crisis also happned because of this agency problem. We probably don’t realise the value of prudent, sustainable intermediation, and we try and overburden this process of intermediation; we think if we put more rules, more controls, we will get around it. The fact of the matter is a very simple principle: if I lend money, I must get it back as it is other people’s money. This fundamental understanding of banking is our biggest challenge.
What further reforms are required in the banking sector?
I don’t want to get into what is now a common debate between public and private sector. I am quite okay if you say that you don’t want public sector banks (PSBs) to go in the hands of the private sector. But are we ready to broadbase the ownership of PSBs to below 50 per cent and let them be widely held? Will the public have confidence once that happens, and is the government obliged to make good the money if things go wrong? These are the two key questions. Today, people put money in PSBs because government is the majority owner.
What is your advice to people who want to become entrepreneurs in the financial sector?
Banking is the toughest of all businesses because your margin of error is very small. I ask any new MBA who joins us and comes to see me, a common-sense question. Say, they have ₹10 of their own and borrow another ₹100, which they lend as ₹110. If they lose ₹10 out of this, they are bankrupt as they have to pay back the ₹100 deposits. If they lose ₹5 out of the ₹10, they don’t have enough capital to remain in business. So the margin for error is only ₹5 or less, out of the ₹110. How prudent you need to be!
My rule is simple. There are two kinds of errors human beings can make — errors of omission and errors of commission. Errors of omission are if I did not do something. If I missed investing in Amazon when it was $1 a share, that is an error of omission. In the investing business, error of omission is more expensive. In banking, error of commission is more expensive because, let’s say, if I lent money — which is an error of commission — and it goes well, I get my principal and interest. If I lose money at 10:1 leverage, I get wiped out. Banking is a business where you can not afford errors of commission.
You headed SEBI’s committee on corporate governance. Recently many incidents have come to light in the banking sector where lending decisions were not above board. What needs to be done to ensure these things don’t happen again?
A good bank of the future needs three human qualities. First, no excessive leverage, which translates to the human quality of prudence. Second, no complex products — simplicity. And third is that bankers are not the masters of the universe, so humility. As long as we keep that in mind every single day, we will live. The day we forget these, we have no future. Also, ask simple questions all the time and have a team that has strong middle-class values and won’t let growth and success go into your head. Banking is the most dangerous and toughest of all businesses.
How do you see the economy shaping up, especially as private investment has not picked up?
The Indian economy is currently at a growth path of 7 per cent. If India has to reach where China is today, it has to grow at 9 per cent per annum for the next 20 years. Can we afford to be complacent at 7 per cent growth? Per-capita GDP is even worse because the population is growing faster than China’s. If we want to see a prosperous India in 10-15 years, how do we create a passion for growth to hit double-digit without overheating. We need to create an environment where India’s growth has the capacity to take faster speed without overheating.
What more should the government do to create that kind of a growth trajectory?
I am a believer that there needs to be fair distribution. But I am a bigger believer that the cake must get bigger. And very often, the choice is between growing the cake and distributing wealth. Governments tend to get excessively focussed on distribution of the cake even if it is smaller. So how do we keep our passion for growing the cake and working on distribution of the cake without affecting the growth? It is not easy because the inevitable question comes — is the cake trickle-down happening or is it getting concentrated? And then the pressure of coming back, getting voted, is a very tough one, because to get voted back, you have to distribute more, even if we may end up with a small cake.
Given that banking has become technology intensive, how do you see its future? Do you see disruption by fintech players as a major issue?
Technology is a very important part and is something we embrace deeply. What we have to be careful about technology is three things: on the lending side, technology means modelling. Make sure the assumptions in your model are right, otherwise it will multiply a problem geometrically. Point two is security. Very often, what keeps me awake at night is: “Will I have a bank next morning? What if somebody has stolen all my customers’ money?” We saw that happen in a small way with the Bangladesh Central Bank. Today’s war on security could be a war by a nation against another nation. It could be us as a bank; it could be a system. Third, where do we draw the line on privacy and use of customer information? As somebody said, customers and consumers get misled by free, but they are not getting it free. The other side is getting all your data. My view is fintech players will partner with banks.
What is your view on branch versus digital banking?
Branches are needed for presence. But the density of the branch network is less than before. Banks can become far more effective through the combination of digital and physical presence. We internally coined the word called ‘phygital’. A customer may want to have the comfort that there is a branch somewhere around, but it need not be as close as it was earlier when he/she had to go to the bank branch. Now, they can do a lot of things on their mobile.
Are there more IL&FS and PNB kind of episodes waiting to happen? 
I am a believer that if something does not make common sense, we should ask tough questions early. And, maybe, the system needed to have a greater introspection on the overall structure of IL&FS over the last 10 or 15 years. It goes back to a very important principle: how do you ensure that as you create layers/structures, the effective leverage does not get much higher than what it should be? 
What is you assessment of the NDA government?
My view is that the economy, on an average, would have grown at 7-plus per cent. I believe India has the potential to grow at 9-10 per cent. I would like to see an obsession with governments for a higher growth rate of the Indian economy. And I do believe that this government has focussed on growth. But like every passionate Indian, I will say “dil maangey more”.
What is your expectation from the monetary policy?
I am not going into specifics whether the policy stance will be in calibrated tightening mode or not. I just feel what is the need of the economy. I genuinely feel there is an opportunity for considering a 50 basis points repo rate cut and a 50 basis points cash reserve ratio (CRR) cut. I think India’s macro is better —- oil is lower, inflation is significantly lower. I know the argument that non-oil, non-food inflation is not as low. But finally, we can’t keep shifting parameters. Finally, we are accountable by CPI (consumer price index based inflation). Absolute CPI is low, annd real interest rates are high. So, this is the opportunity.
As far as CRR cut is concerned, there is a significant increase in currency in circulation, which is effectively money gone out of the formal system, back under the mattresses. We are getting into election season. So, currency in circulation will increase even more in the short run. We need to re-balance it by providing more formal liquidity, which comes through a CRR cut."

Pullela Gopichand Badminton Foundation is gearing up to expand its facilities, while setting up a Sports Science Centre and a Research and Development (R&D) Centre.
The Foundation, known to have played a major role in transforming the country’s badminton sport, has teamed up with Kotak Mahindra Bank to develop a world-class training facility and advanced infrastructure and create a platform to train coaches.
“As a part of this engagement with the Gopichand Academy, we will invest about ₹30-35 crore in upgradingfacilities at the academy. Apart from education, we are also looking at providing encouragement to sports,” Dipak Gupta, Joint Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra Bank, said.
Gupta explained that after focusing on education, the bank has begun engaging with different sports and this is one step towards that initiative. “We are also looking at some other sports to engage with and wrestling is top among our priorities,” he said.
Pullela Goipichand, the legendary Indian badminton player, coach and founder trustee of Pullela Gopichand Badminton Foundation, said, “The objective of the Foundation is to train, nurture and guide young talent with the purpose of developing international badminton champions. We will work together towards our shared vision of developing outstanding athletes and coaches.”
Gopichand said the programme entails construction of a high performance training centre comprising of six air-conditioned badminton courts in the premises at Gachibowli in Hyderabad, a Sports Science Centre and the upcoming new training centre.
The sports science centre will get top quality resident nutritionists, physiotherapists and conditioning experts on board for all round development of players and to ensure that the badminton coaching imparted by the academy is at par with global standards.
Gopichand said, “Unlike in some countries, where the progress of a sportsperson is mapped from his/her childhood, we do not have such facilities here. We hope to now create such a facility, where we can monitor their progress from their early stage through to their career.”
“Over the last 3-4 years, Badminton popularity has grown by leaps and bounds and now we have three players in top 10, and about 5-6 players in top 10. And this number will go up with better training facilities and quality coaches. We do not have training facilities for coaches and we plan to bridge that demand,” he said."

15,2019-03-10,Kotak,"RBI-Kotak stand-off: Review panel for ownership norms among key proposals 
 Amid calls for changes to the contentious ownership norms for private sector lenders, the RBI is likely to look into various proposals including setting up of a review panel and making the regulations more friendly towards Indian control of home -grown banks.
 The move is significant as it comes in the wake of the regulator having been dragged to the Bombay High Court by Kotak Mahindra Bank. Its peer Bandhan Bank merged with Gruh Finance, in a deal widely considered to have been driven by the need to comply with the promoter shareholding norms.
“RBI has received at least three proposals and one of them relates to setting up a review committee on ownership norms for private sector banks and all options are being explored, a source said. 
 Other proposals relate to individual cases including granting more time and more possible routes to meet the norms, unlike the review panel one which would have wider ramifications for the entire sector, the source added.
 The common viewpoint on both sites is that the stand-off with Kotak Mahindra Bank needs to be resolved at the earliest as it might be sending a wrong impression to the investor community, including the foreign institutions.
 An email sent to the banking regulator did not elicit a response immediately. Governor Shaktikanta Das had recently declined to answer a specific question on whether the RBI is mulling a re-look at the promoter shareholding norms, citing that the matter is sub0judice. 
 It can be noted that KMB had taken the unprecedented action of dragging the RBI to court last year, days ahead of the December 31 deadline to get the promoter holding down to 20 per cent from the around 30 per cent loomed.
 The Bombay High Court has refused any temporary relief to KMB and the matter is scheduled to come up for hearing on Tuesday.
 The bank had proposed one preference share route to reduce the promoter shareholding in August 2018, only to be shot down by the regulator. 
 In late December, there was also speculation of billionaire investor Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathway entering KMB. 
 Kotak has found support from the right-wing bodies, who have been urging the RBI to not insist on the promoter holding requirements, saying this will naturally increase the foreign investors’ play in the Indian banks. 
The Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), a right-leaning think tank, has said it is high time for a review of regulations and for re-working the model of governance and ownership norms for Indian private sector banks.
 The Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) has also said there was an urgent need for a rethink on the regulatory framework for private bank ownership so that it remains in Indian hands.
“None of us want Indian homegrown banks to go into hands of foreign players,” the SJM had said recently.
 Almost all major private sector lenders have ownership of over 50 per cent by foreign investors collectively. The RBI wants the banks to have a diversified ownership in best interest of governance practices and also limits the voting rights in cases.
 In the last few months, Kotak group has successfully tapped into foreign money like getting a USD 500 million commitment from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) to invest in stressed assets in the country.
 In case of Bandhan Bank, the micro-lender turned commercial bank announced a deal months after facing regulatory pressure for not complying with promoter shareholding requirements.
The RBI had refused to allow the lender from automatically opening branches and had also frozen CEO C S Ghosh’s remuneration.
 The bank responded with the all-share Gruh deal, which brought down the promoter shareholding to 60 per cent, which is still higher than the 40 per cent requirement. In media interactions, the bank management has sounded confident of meeting the 40 per cent level."
14,2019-03-11,Kotak,"Bombay HC to hear Kotak Mahindra plea on promoter-shareholding norms today 


The Bombay High Court will take up for hearing the writ petition by private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank on the issue of promoter-shareholding norms by the Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday.
The court had, on January 17, adjourned the hearing after the RBI senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond sought more time to file the affidavit in response to the writ petition.
The case is being closely followed as it is perhaps for the first time that a bank is approaching the courts on an RBI directive. Many bankers and experts, who did not wish to be named, see it as a direct challenge to the regulator.
At the core is the contentious issue of diluting the promoter shareholding in the bank to 20 per cent by December 31, 2018, from close to 30 per cent at present. The RBI had said the issuance of Perpetual Non-Convertible Preference Shares (PNCPS) by the lender in August last year did not meet its requirements for diluting the shareholding.
Kotak Mahindra Bank had filed the writ petition on December 10 last year on the Banking Regulation Act, and had sought validation on whether its issuance of PNCPS met the regulatory requirements. It is being heard by a two-judge bench of the Bombay High Court comprising justices BP Dharmadhikari and Sarang V Kotwal. It has not given any interim relief to Kotak Mahindra Bank, and had refused to grant a stay on the December 31, 2018, deadline set by the RBI.
Though there has been speculation that there could be an out-of-court settlement, both Kotak Mahindra Bank and RBI have remained silent on the issue and said the matter is sub-judice.
Meanwhile, pressure is mounting on the RBI to review the promoter shareholding norms, although it is unlikely to look into the issue at present.
Another private sector lender, Bandhan Bank, recently merged with Gruh Finance, which has been seen as a means to meet the RBI’s promoter shareholding norms.
On Monday, shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank gained 0.88 per cent to close at ₹1,248.85 apiece on the BSE."

The Bombay High Court, on Tuesday, adjourned the hearing of the writ petition filed by Kotak Mahindra Bank on the dilution of promoter stake to April 1, and refused to give interim relief to the lender against the Reserve Bank of India’s norms for dilution of promoter shareholding.
Harish Salve, the counsel for Kotak Mahindra Bank, offered that until the matter is finally heard, the voting rights may be capped at 20 per cent as the main issue flagged by the RBI is concentration of control, which is exercised by voting rights. The case was heard by a bench comprising justices AS Oka and MS Sanklecha. The suggestion was, however, not accepted by the bench, which pointed out that the matter is not as simple as that.
Salve also pointed out that it is difficult to sell the quantum of shares as directed by the RBI, and that the central bank cannot force the bank’s promoters to sell their shares. The matter was then adjourned to April 1 due to lack of time. This is the second time that the Bombay High Court has refused to give interim protection to the lender against the RBI’s norms for lowering promoter shareholding to 20 per cent from the current 30 per cent. The deadline lapsed on December 31, 2018.

10,2019-03-27,Kotak,"Promoter stake within ‘permissible level’ of original licence conditions: Kotak Bank


Kotak Mahindra Bank has blamed the Reserve Bank of India for shifting the terms and rules of promoter shareholding in private lenders; it said the central bank is now asking the private lender to lower the promoter stake on grounds that are different from the conditions under which it was given a banking licence.
“The licence did not require the promoter shareholding to be reduced to 49 per cent of the paid-up capital of the bank. It is, therefore, clear that 49 per cent was and is the “permissible level” of promoter shareholding in case of Petitioner 1 (Kotak Mahindra Bank),” the bank told the Bombay High Court in the ongoing litigation.
BusinessLine has reviewed a copy of the reply filed by the bank in the ongoing litigation. 
The RBI had asked the bank to cut promoter shareholding to 20 per cent of paid-up capital by December 31, 2018, and 15 per cent by March 31, 2020.
As on December 31, 2018, Uday Kotak, the bank’s vice-chairman and managing director, held 29.72 per cent stake in the bank. The bank, in August 2018, had proposed perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (PNCPS) to cut promoter shareholding to 19.70 per cent, which the RBI rejected.
The bank has challenged the RBI’s contention in the Bombay High Court, which is hearing the matter. Kotak Mahindra Bank told the Bombay High Court that the promoters’ stake in the lender remains within “permissible limits” of the original conditions under which it was granted licence in 2002. Within private sector banks, the rules on ownership, promoter shareholding, and voting rights have changed significantly over the last two decades.
For instance, for all licences issued in 1993, as well as under the 2001 guidelines, promoter shareholding was capped at 40 per cent. 
The 2001 Guidelines on Entry of New Banks in the Private Sector required promoters to dilute their stake in private banks to 40 per cent or below within one year of operation.
This was changed in June 2002 when the RBI decided to raise the maximum limit of shareholding of Indian promoters in private sector banks from 40 per cent to 49 per cent of their paid-up capital “in order to provide a level-playing field”.
In February 2005, in the Guidelines on Ownership and Governance of Private Sector Banks, the RBI stated that “where any existing shareholding by any individual entity/group of related entities is in excess of 10 per cent, the bank will be required to indicate a time-table for reduction of holding to the permissible level. While considering such cases, the RBI will also take into account the terms and conditions of the banking licences”.
The rule was changed when the RBI issued Universal Banking Guidelines, first in 2013, and later in 2016. The new rules now require that the non-operating finance holding company (NOFHC), or the promoter group, shall progressively bring down its shareholding from a minimum of 40 per cent to a maximum of 15 per cent within 15 years.
Kotak Mahindra Bank told the Bombay High Court that the “permissible level” for shareholders in a bank (as was determined in the 2005 Ownership and Governance Guidelines) “would necessarily have to be determined in line with the terms and conditions of the licence”.
“In the case of the Petitioner No 1 (Kotak Mahindra Bank), the licence did not require the promoter shareholding to be reduced below 49 per cent of the paid-up capital of the bank,” it told the court.
Also, when the bank sought the RBI’s clarification on the “permissible level” of promoter shareholding, “the RBI did not respond or provide any guidance, but merely insisted on a roadmap to be provided for reduction of promoter shareholding”, said Kotak Mahindra Bank."
9,2019-03-31,Kotak,"It is about the bank, not promoters: Kotak Mahindra tells RBI 
Locked in a legal battle with RBI over promoter stake dilution issue, Kotak Mahindra Bank has alleged the regulator is “unfairly” creating an impression that the lender was trying to further promoter Uday Kotak’s interest. 
Countering an affidavit filed by the Reserve Bank of India in the Bombay High Court where it has challenged a regulatory directive, Kotak Mahindra Bank said the reply unfairly seeks to create an impression that the promoters’ interest is being furthered through the petition, and seeks to question the locus standi of the petitioners (the bank) in challenging the reduction communications. 
RBI had asked the bank to cut promoter shareholding to 20 per cent of paid-up capital by December 31, 2018, and 15 per cent by March 31, 2020.
As on December 31, 2018, Uday Kotak, the bank’s vice-chairman and managing director, held 29.72 per cent stake in the bank.
The lender in August 2018 had proposed perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (PNCPS) to cut promoter holding to 19.70 per cent, which the RBI rejected. 
The bank has challenged RBI’s contention in the Bombay High Court, which is hearing the matter.
The RBI’s bank licensing rules mandate that a private bank’s promoter will need to pare holding to 40 per cent within three years, 20 per cent within 10 years and to 15 per cent within 15 years.
The RBI has told the Bombay High Court that the bank has petitioned the court, and not the promoters whose shareholding the central bank has asked to be lowered.
The RBI’s decisions seek to regulate the shareholding rights of bank’s promoters, the central bank said. 
“They (the promoters) have no issue with holding being regulated in the manner provided for by the RBI,” the banking regulator had told the Bombay High Court in response to Kotak Mahindra Bank’s petition challenging RBI’s direction to trim promoter shareholding.
In response, Kotak Mahindra Bank has said in an affidavit filed with the court that if that were the case, the RBI cannot take any action against the petitioner (the bank) in relation to these matters (i.e. reduction of promoter shareholding).
The bank also said in such a case, the regulator’s series of correspondence over several years with the bank, and not the promoter, becomes questionable. 
The RBI has wrongly addressed correspondence to the petitioner (the bank) over the years, wherein it has also threatened regulatory action, the bank said. 
If the RBI’s stand that such matters related to or affect the bank’s promoters, then the RBI would have no basis to initiate any action against the bank for not paring promoter shareholding.
Moreover, the bank told the court that RBI’s view runs contrary to its own allegation that failure to reduce promoter shareholding would result in the bank being in serious breach of law.
“The RBI has attempted to unfairly allege that the bank needs to be more independent and not reflect the interest of just one individual or family is mischievous, incorrect, ignores the high standards of governance of the bank,” it added.
The bank denied the allegations and what it termed as insinuations and said it also belittles the impact of the RBI’s unreasonable and arbitrary position on the bank, its shareholders, depositors and public at large.
The bank said reducing promoter shareholding would require raising a huge amount of capital not warranted for its business and growth, which would be detrimental to all stakeholders, including non-promoter shareholders, and disruptive to the banking system.
Any suggestion that the petition is a device to benefit any vested interests is baseless, misconceived and devoid of any merit."

The writ petition filed by Kotak Mahindra Bank on the promoter shareholding norms stipulated by the Reserve Bank of India did not come up for hearing before the Bombay High Court on Monday. 
Though the matter has been adjourned to January next year due to a lack of time, the two parties are likely to request an earlier date for hearing, possibly this week.
“On account of paucity of time, matter stands adjourned to January 9, 2020,” said the Bombay High Court in its order, adding, “If any ad-interim relief or interim relief is operative till today, the same will be continue to operate till the next date. If ad-interim or interim relief is not granted for a limited period, the said order will remain unaffected.”
The case is being heard by a Bench of Justice AK Oka and Justice MS Sanklecha of the Bombay High Court. The Bench had earlier heard the matter on April 1 and had given two weeks’ time to the bank for filing an affidavit of the promoters, setting out the compliance made with the directions of the RBI regarding dilution of their shareholding.
The Bombay High Court had previously refused to grant interim relief to Kotak Mahindra Bank in the case.
The case relates to the issue of diluting promoter shareholding in the bank to 20 per cent by December 31, 2018, from close to 30 per cent at present. The RBI had said the issuance of Perpetual Non-Convertible Preference Shares (PNCPS) by the lender in August last year did not meet its requirements.
Kotak had filed the writ petition on December 10 last year on the Banking Regulation Act, and had sought validation on whether its issuance of PNCPS met the regulatory requirements."

Uday Kotak, Managing Director and CEO, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said the bank has seen “good, stable and sustained” growth.
When asked about the bank’s Writ Petition in the Bombay High Court on the the RBI’s promoter shareholding norms, he declined to comment as the matter is subjudice. “We truly believe we are in compliance with the law of the land in letter and spirit,” he told reporters, when asked about the hearing date being adjourned to January 2020.
Meanwhile, he also said the bank has no exposure to debt-ridden Jet Airways, or the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group firms.
“The bank will remain conservative on the real estate sector as the pain is still not over,” he said.
With the auto sector facing a slowdown and a perceived change in consumer behaviour due to ride hailing apps, the bank will also remain cautious in lending to the auto industry.
For 2019-20, Kotak said he expects loan growth at about 20 per cent. The board of directors of the bank proposed a dividend of ₹0.80 per share of ₹5 face value for 2018-19."

Veteran banker Uday Kotak, on Tuesday, said the turbulence in the financial sector could eventually impact the real economy as well.
“We are in the midst of one of the very significant financial challenges. The next six months are crucial on how India handles the financial sector to take it to safe waters from turbulent waters,” said Kotak, Managing Director (MD) and CEO, Kotak Mahindra Bank.
While the banking sector had benefited from a flush of liquidity after demonetisation, Kotak said this is now moving back to illiquid assets such as land and real estate, leading to tighter liquidity conditions. Cash in circulation is now at a high, he pointed out. Coupled with the long non-performing assets (NPA) cycle after 2011, Kotak said this has become a significant challenge for the whole financial sector. “What happened at IL&FS could be the first signal of the challenge of the financial sector,” he said.
Meanwhile, when asked about the challenges in the non-banking financial companies (NBFC) sector, he noted that there are a lot of players in the market.
While some are doing very well, others are not doing so well, with problems in underwriting and various other issues.
“Solutions in the sector include new equity, combinations and mortality, of which I would like to see more of the first two,” he said. Kotak also said he is watching the auto sector very closely. Passenger car sales have seen a slowdown and though the apparent reason seems to be availability of finance, he questioned if there is also a fundamental structural change in consumer behaviour.
This could possibly be due to ride-hailing apps, he added, while stressing that it is too early to have a definite answer as there are also pockets of unmet demand."

4,2019-06-23,Kotak,"NBFC crisis not a systemic risk: Uday Kotak
A slowing growth in the GDP and the limited fiscal space are some of the challenges that India is facing, and there is a need to take bold steps to reform the financial sector, the real and social infrastructure, remove bottlenecks in different segments and unleash the economy, according to Uday Kotak.
The veteran banker, however, does not believe that the current crisis in some non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) is posing a systemic risk. He stressed the need to repair and nurture the financial institutions.
Pointing to a 10-year cyclical pattern that has marred global financial markets in the last two decades — such as the South-East Asian crisis of 1998 and the global financial crisis in 2008 — Kotak said 2018 witnessed tremors once again in the Indian financial sector.
“I see 2019 and 2020 as the years to cleanse, repair and nurture Indian financial institutions. Both practitioners and policy-makers have the work cut out for us,” he said in Kotak Mahindra Bank’s annual report for 2018-19.
“The major issue talked about is liquidity. However, I see it as the price of liquidity,” said the CEO and MD of Kotak Mahindra Bank. The bank will hold its annual general meeting on July 22.
Kotak, who along with other entities in the promoter group owns, 30 per cent in the bank, received a remuneration of ₹3.24 crore for 2018-19, which was an increase of 10.99 per cent.
Kotak also chairs the new board of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), which is mandated by the government to resolve issues there.
Though concerns on some solvency cases are weighing on the markets, Kotak said: “I do not, at this stage, see this as a systemic risk, and am confident that the policy-makers and regulators will take steps to manage the situation.”
Kotak’s comments come at a time when there are concerns over defaults by various NBFCs and expectations that the government and the Reserve Bank of India will take further measures to address these issues.
He said there is a need to bring down the deposit rates of banks for better transmission, but the high rates of government schemes and the distortion in yields due to differential tax treatment on debt instruments pose a challenge.
He also said with a strong and stable government and the “significant structural, political transformation”, it is now the time to focus on “economic transformation”.
“The slowing GDP growth and the limited fiscal space are some of them (the challenges),” Kotak said. 
He added that in previous years, the challenges of the real sector had impacted the financial sector, but now the reverse is also true."

The Bombay High Court, on Tuesday, disposed of an application filed by a third-party on behalf of deposit holders, who wanted to become party to the writ petition filed by Kotak Mahindra Bank against the Reserve Bank of India on promoter shareholding norms.
The case was heard by a division bench of Justice SJ Kathawalla and Justice Akil Kureshi. The court said there is no locus standi to intervene in the matter, and that the petition does not have any degree of seriousness. Hence, it directed the petitioner to withdraw the case.
The petitioner wanted to become a party to the case alleging collusion between Kotak Mahindra Bank and the RBI, and said there was a large amount of public money involved.
Kotak Mahindra Bank had filed the writ petition in the Bombay High Court on December 10 last year on the Banking Regulation Act, and had sought validation on whether its issuance of Perpetual Non-Convertible Preference Shares (PNCPS) met the regulatory requirements.
Under RBI norms, promoters were expected to dilute their stake in the bank to 20 per cent by December 31, 2018, from close to 30 per cent at present.
The case was adjourned, and the next date of hearing is January 9, 2020.
The RBI had, in June, imposed a ₹2-crore penalty on Kotak Mahindra Bank for not complying with its directions on furnishing information about dilution of promoters’ shareholding.
