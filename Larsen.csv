94,2018-05-28,Larsen,"L&T Q4 net profit up 5% to Rs 3,167 cr 
 Infrastructure giant L&T today registered 4.72 per cent jump in consolidated net profit to Rs 3,167.47 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017-18.
 It had clocked a net profit of Rs 3,024.61 crore in the January-March quarter of the preceding fiscal, 2016-17.
“The consolidated gross revenue in the quarter January to March 2018 totalled Rs 40,678 crore recording an increase of 10 per cent on a year-on-year basis,” Larsen and Toubro said in a statement.
 Its total expenses during the quarter under review grew to Rs 36,198.11 crore as against Rs 33,464.06 crore during the year-ago quarter.
The order intake grew 5 per cent to Rs 49,557 crore during the quarter, it said, adding that international order inflow at Rs 8,678 crore constituted 18 per cent of the order inflow for the 3-month period.
Consolidated order book of the group stood at Rs 2,63,107 crore as at March 31, 2018, with international order book constituting 24 per cent of the total order book.
Infra segment
During the quarter January-March 2018, the infrastructure segment recorded order inflow of Rs 33,455 crore registering a growth of 27 per cent over the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The order book of the segment stood at Rs 1,95,419 crore as of March 31, 2018.
 The company said, “Domestic reforms such as GST, RERA and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code have led to disruptions in the year gone by, though these are expected to lead to sustainable long term growth.” 
These reform measures along with increased flow of funds from multilateral institutions aided by supportive policies such as pursuance of ‘Make in India’ initiative, focus on infrastructure buildout, etc are likely to improve the investment climate in the country, it said.
“With tax revenues estimated to show buoyancy through nominal GDP growth and widening of the tax base, budgetary allocations for infrastructure are scheduled to increase although the short term focus of the government could well be on development of rural India through social welfare schemes,” it said in outlook.
Revival of stressed business through the IBC is targeted at progressive resolution of the twin balance sheet problems and is the first step in facilitating increased credit lines to kick start private sector capex, the company said.
 The order book of the company’s power segment stood at Rs 9,357 crore, a decline of 32 per cent.
 Heavy Engineering order book increased by 13 per cent to Rs 13,523 crore.

93,2018-05-28,Larsen,"L&T consolidated net up 5% at ₹3,167 cr in Q4
Infrastructure major Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) has reported a consolidated net profit of ₹3,167 crore in the fourth quarter ended March 2018, an increase of 5 per cent from ₹3,025 crore in the same quarter of the previous year. 
The company recorded a 10 per cent growth in consolidated gross revenue in the quarter to ₹40,678 crore against ₹36,620 crore in the corresponding period last year. Net profit for FY18 registered 22 per cent growth at ₹7,370 crore. 
The group's consolidated revenue for the year grew by 9 per cent to ₹119,862 crore.
The company expects to achieve 12-15 per cent revenue growth and 10-12 per cent growth in the order inflow during the current fiscal, said L&T CFO R Shankar Raman.
According to him, government reforms such as GST, RERA and the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) are among positive sentiments for the infrastructure space in the country and are likely to improve the overall investment climate in the country.
Public capex
During the year ended March 2018, the company has been focussing mainly on the domestic market from the government sector. L&T bagged fresh orders worth ₹152,908 crore at the group level during FY18 with international orders' share declining to 23 per cent in FY18 from 29 per cent to 23 per cent a year earlier. 
The company's total consolidated order book stood at ₹263,107 crore as at March 31, 2018.
“Despite limited opportunities, L&T has achieved 7 per cent growth in new orders,” Raman said. In November last year, the company has revised its target for order inflow, earlier set at 10-12 per cent, saying the order inflow “would remain flat”.
According to Raman, for FY19, L&T will remain dependent on orders from the public sector as private investments remain elusive.
SN Subrahmanyan, CEO and MD, said the company is becoming dependent on government orders with around 70 per cent of new orders believed to be coming from the public sector.
“It will take another two-three years for the private capex to come up,” he said, adding that, “so far, we are only seeing offshoots of private capex, mainly in the metals space”.
L&T has written off “non-moving” orders of up to ₹16,000 crore from its order book. These orders, according to the company's management, were mainly in the real estate space and across other infrastructure segments.
Infra focus
The infrastructure segment emerged as the leader among other businesses in terms of order inflow for L&T. 
During the Q4FY18, the segment recorded order inflow of ₹33,455 crore registering a growth of 27 per cent over the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The segment secured fresh orders of ₹87,277 crore during the enitre FY18, up by 11 per cent from the year earlier."

   -  BusinessLine


 To remain “an EPC company with developmental orientation”, Larsen & Toubro plans to exit non-core projects as soon as the committed ones are complete, L&T CEO and MD SN Subrahmanyan told BusinessLine. 
For the past several years L&T has been offloading non-core assets. It has earlier this month sold its electric and automation business to French giant Schneider Electric for ₹14,000 crore. It is in the process of finalising sale of its Kattupalli port near Chennai to Adani Ports. 
Asked about other divestments, Subrahmanyan said L&T is looking at the special steels and heavy forgings business and the Kattupalli shipyard as the company has not been able to turn them around.
L&T Special Steels and Heavy Forgings, a joint venture with Nuclear Power Corporation of India where L&T has 74 per cent stake, runs a in Hazira a heavy forgings plant to supply mainly to the hydrocarbon and nuclear power sectors. The JV has invested around ₹1,700 crore in the first phase while the second has been put on hold. In FY17, the company reported a net loss of ₹255 crore on an operating income of ₹118 crore.
“...we don’t see the economy growing in such a way that it will bring many orders into that shop,” Subrahmanyan said. 
Kattupali shipyard, in which the company had invested around ₹5,000 crore, currently has a turnover of around ₹800; it has to be at least ₹2,500 crore to be viable, according to Subrahmanyan. “We designed it to be focussed on naval shipbuilding... so we need to see how the Indian Navy comes out with more orders. Unless some big programmes come, it (the investment) will not be revived,” he said.
Building and selling
L&T plans to exit several infrastructure projects, too, including Hyderabad Metro and 1,400 MW Nabha coal-fired power plant in Punjab.
“We have done our job in terms of EPC, we are operating these assets, we have proved they can be run very efficiently, we have built good leadership and teams there, but we are not a development kind of organisation,” Subrahmanyan said.
L&T recently offloaded five road assets through a private infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) IndInfravit Trust, sponsored by L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd (L&T IDPL). The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Allianz Capital Partners (ACP) earlier this month announced acquiring 30 per cent and 25 per cent of IndInfravit units respectively. L&T IDPL will hold 15 per cent of the units. 
L&T raised around ₹4,700 crore through the InvIT and will continue to look for similar opportunities in the 10 road projects that are under construction."

 L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Limited (L&T IDPL), a subsidiary of infrastructure major Larsen & Toubro (L&T), is looking at expanding its power transmission portfolio by bidding for new projects and acquiring brownfield assets.
“We are currently looking to expand our power transmission portfolio, so we will be happy to lok at purchasing power transmission acquiring assets, including those of PowerGrid corportaion,” Shailesh Pathak, CEO of L&T IDPL said.
The company currently operates the Kudgi Power Transmission Line project in Karnataka and has been recently prequalified for projects tendered by Jharkand under Tariff Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) route, Pathak added.
Funds raising
L&T IDPL last month raised over ₹3,000 crore through private placement of its infrastructure investment trust IndInfravit Trust where Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Allianz Capital Partners (ACP) has acted anchor investors. CPPIV had acquired 30 per cent of IndInfravit units for around ₹2,045 crore and ACP has acquired 25 per cent for ₹ 925 crore. L&T IDPL will hold 15 per cent of the InvIT units.
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) has made investment of ₹2,000 crore in L&T IDPL in 2014.
IndInfravit Trust acquired five operational toll roads of its sponsor, IDPL, which prior to the transaction had 16 road assets in total, out of which two are annuity projects and 14 are toll projects. 
“We have to look for further monetization as time passes. We have just completed two highways , one in Orissa and one in Telangana, the moment two years cash flow behaviour passes, we could put these two projects into the InvIT,” Pathak said.
He added that in the road space, the company will continue exploring all existing opportunities -- from pure BOT (build-operate-transfer) to HAM (hybrid annuity model) and brownfield project. It will also look at participating in the next rounds of government tenders for operational national highways through the toll-operate-transfer (ToT) model.
Eye on margins
“We will be interested in everything provided it makes us money,” Pathak said adding that IDPL is not likely to bid aggressively as the era of “suicidal” bidding for road projects that used to happen in case of BOT tenders floated earlier is over. 
“Witht the IBC it is very diofficult to folow the earlier strategy of bidding to win at suicidal rates and then try to renegotiate, iu think that busioness model is over,” he noted."

81,2018-08-21,Larsen,"L&T: Engineered for success
As a play on the domestic infrastructure theme, led by government spending on key projects, and a revival in capex in segments such as hydrocarbons due to the rise in crude oil prices, engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro (L&T) is in a favourable spot.
Even though capital investments from the private sector are yet to revive in a big way in India, the Government has increased spending significantly on infrastructure projects in several areas, including on roads, ports, metros, irrigation projects and power transmission. Given its entrenched presence in all these areas and proven execution capabilities, L&T is well-placed to benefit from contract awards in all these segments.
Steady inflow of contracts, especially in the infrastructure segment, a solid order book and a favourable mix of domestic and international revenue are key positives for the company.
Additionally, three of its listed subsidiaries — L&T Finance Holdings, L&T Infotech and L&T Technology Services — have delivered robust performances over the past few years and continue to have a healthy outlook.
At ₹1,242, the stock trades at 18 times its likely per share earnings for FY20. This is lower than the three-year average price-earnings multiple of 22.
Investors with a two-three year horizon can consider buying the stock.
 








 
In FY18, L&T’s consolidated revenue increased by 9 per cent over 2016-17 to ₹1.19 lakh crore, while net profits rose by 22 per cent over the same period to ₹7,370 crore. The first quarter results indicate that the company continues to be on a strong revival path, with revenue increasing 19 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹28,300 crore, while net profits improved by 36 per cent to ₹1,200 crore.
Gains from Infra push
The company was set on the revival path in FY18 after overcoming the challenges posed by demonetisation and GST. L&T had an order inflow of ₹1.53 lakh crore in 2017-18, a 6.9 per cent growth over the previous fiscal.
The company’s order book stood at ₹2.63 lakh crore as of March 2018. It rose further to ₹2.72 lakh crore by June 2018, which is 2.3 times its FY18 revenues, thus giving it substantial visibility.
Large projects such as the Hyderabad metro rail facility and the Kannur airport have been commissioned in FY18. It also continues to witness traction in the construction of high-rise office buildings and factories.
L&T continues to win contracts to commission mass transit systems in India and abroad. The company has also won EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contracts from the Railways in the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor project.
The company is focused on EPC projects as far as road construction goes, though most of the contracts awarded by the NHAI are in the hybrid annuity model mode.
L&T also has a healthy geographic mix, with nearly 33 per cent of its revenue coming from international locations. West Asian countries dominate the international revenue streams though.
The company’s hydrocarbon segment, which accounts for over 10 per cent of the order book and caters to the oil and gas industry globally, has witnessed a healthy revival in demand, thanks to the spike in crude oil prices over the last one year and the resultant increase in capex from players in the space.
The Defence segment, where government orders were slow to come by, has witnessed greater traction over the past few quarters. In the recent June quarter, L&T’s Defence engineering segment recorded a 37 per cent growth over the same period last fiscal.
Subsidiaries deliver
L&T’s listed technology subsidiaries have done extremely well on the revenue and margin fronts consistently over the past few years.
L&T Infotech and L&T Technology Services look set to achieve strong double-digit revenue growth in FY19, when the IT industry itself is expected grow by 7-9 per cent, in dollar terms, according to the trade body Nasscom. Both companies have been among the top few mid-tier software services players. With a weak rupee, margins would get a boost. L&T holds over 80 per cent stake in these companies as the profits from these firms will strengthen its own bottom-line.
L&T Financial Services too had a good FY18, with disbursals growing at a healthy space. Net NPAs were down to 2.34 per cent from 5.02 per cent in the previous fiscal, suggesting that it has recovered considerably from the effects of the currency ban. Its assets under management in the investment management business increased by 68 per cent in FY18 to ₹65,392 crore.
These subsidiaries are likely to add considerable value to consolidated financials of the company."

Target: ₹1,530
Key takeaways: a) Larsen & Toubro invested ₹500 crore into L&T Special Steel and Forgings taking its total investments to ₹900 crore; b) L&T invested ₹700 crore into L&T shipbuilding taking its total investments to ₹3,100 crore; c) L&T invested an additional ₹200 crore into Hyderabad Metro increasing its investment to ₹2,200 crore in FY18. With fresh investments being restricted and the company focussing on divestment of non-core assets, we expect incremental investments only for Hyderabad Metro, and to fund losses in L&T Shipbuilding and Special Steel and Forgings.
We maintain Buy with an SOTP-based target price of ₹1,560 (E&C business at 21x FY20E EPS, higher-end of five-year trading band to which we add ₹550 for subsidiaries). L&T remains our top pick in the sector — we believe it is an attractive play on a recovery in industrial and infrastructure capex in India. 
Key risks to our rating: a) Unexpected slowdown in government infrastructure spending; and b) A sharp fall in oil prices."

 The board of directors of engineering giant Larsen & Toubro on Thursday approved the acquisition of six crore shares at a maximum of ₹1,500 apiece. The total buyback will be worth ₹9,000 crore.
The procedure will be completed in 90 days. The L&T board also recommended a dividend of ₹16 per share. The dividend in the previous year was ₹14 per share. 
In a BSE filing, L&T said the price for the buyback will be determined by the board or a committee. It will be at a premium on the daily average of the closing prices on the NSE for the two-week period prior to the board meeting, and will be capped at ₹1,500 per share.
The board’s decision was ratified by the investors at the company’s AGM on Thursday. L&T Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director SN Subrahmanyan told reporters after the AGM that the buyback is a positive indicator of the economy and the company. 
The L&T stock settled at ₹1,352.50 on the BSE, up 2.3 per cent from the previous close. In intra-day trade, the stock had touched a high of ₹1,363.90 and a low of ₹1,320. 
Shares of L&T have risen 9 per cent ever since the company announced its intention to buy back shares on Saturday (August 18).
The buyback, the first by L&T, would constitute 4.29 per cent and 4.7 per cent of of the total paid-up equity share capital and market capitalisation of the company, respectively."

The 73rd AGM of engineering giant Larsen & Tubro (L&T) today witnessed some unpleasant scenes with an irate group non-executive chairman AM Naik summoning security marshals to evict shareholders who questioned him for getting the company’s land to set up a cancer hospital in his granddaughter’s memory.
The drama began when Uday Dixit, a shareholder and an ex-employee of L&T, which is the only large company majority-owned by employees, questioned the rationale for the board to allow Naik to set up a super specialty cancer hospital at the Powai campus in memory of Nirali, Naik’s granddaughter who died of the dreaded disease as a child.
It may be noted that while announcing the hospital Naik had said it was “his monument and legacy to L&T”. Dixit and a few other shareholders said the land allotted for the proposed hospital was supposed to be a manufacturing facility of the company till 2019.
“The land belongs to the collector who has given the licence to the company for manufacturing till 2019. How can you demolish it? We are not fools. How can the structure be demolished before 2019 and build a hospital and residential units? Let shareholders know,” Dixit said.
To this Naik said L&T had paid the money for the land and so it belongs to the company.
To calm down the tempo, Managing Director and Chief Executive SN Subramanyan intervened saying, “we have done it as per the rules and regulations of the company as well as per the government norms. The hospital is not only for employees but also for the general public. “We have taken all the necessary permissions and so there is nothing illegal. Moreover, the land will continue to belong to L&T. We have all the documents and I am answering you with all responsibility,” Subramanyan said.
As the shareholders continued to interfere during the replies, Naik lost his cool and asked Dixit and others to shut up, angering the shareholders who demanded to be heard.
 
Marshals called in
Following this Naik called security marshals, saying “this is a shareholders’ meeting and not a forum for your individual grievances. Where is the security? Let others talk and if anyone interrupts unnecessarily, throw them out.”
Another shareholder wondered why Naik, who retired last September should continue to call the shots. “At 75, tell me Mr Naik, why can’t you sit at home and play with the kids.” This forced Subramanyan to intervene again and told the shareholders that “Naik has been with this company from nowhere to whatever he is today. And I hope all of you benefited during his tenure including four bonus issues and now a buyback and dividend. Now at 75, he has retired and is only a non-executive chairman.”
Some shareholders also did not like the ₹9,000-crore share buyback announced saying they will not wish to give up their shares and suggested that the company go for a rights issue.
One shareholder said he stands to lose if he gives up his shares for the money. “I would want to keep the shares for my future generation as I have been possessing L&T shares which originally belonged to my parents. If I retain them, I may earn higher returns in future.”"

“As part of our strategy, strengthening our SME lending business is a key focus area for us. The supply chain finance business is a fast growing area and we wish to increase our presence in this space.

L&T Finance’s supply chain vertical provides working capital finance to entities that are suppliers to large industrial manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The company, with a combined customer base of about 800, also provides channel finance and inventory finance to dealers.
“This move is in line with L&T Finance’s dual objective of concentrating on our core strengths and retailisation of our overall lending book.

72,2018-09-05,Larsen,"L&T shareholder moves NCLT, alleging fraud in employee fund 
Uday Dixit, a shareholder and former employee of L&T whom the company’s top boss AM Naik had ordered to be removed from the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) last month, has approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) alleging fraud and mismanagement of employee welfare fund and assets of the company.
Dixit has claimed in his petition that the top management of L&T, including Naik, are guilty of fraud on shareholders and employees of L&T. The petition before the NCLT claims that L&T had deducted a sum from the salaries of its employees, including his, between 2003 and 2008, including his, without taking due consent. The Employee Welfare Foundation, which was registered as a trust, was converted into a private limited company and its funds were used to avail loan from ICICI Bank and purchase 15.73 per cent stake of L&T held by Grasim between 2003 and 2005.
The petition says, even though a Memorandum of Settlement regarding wages scale and other payables to workers was signed and given to the workers by the company’s union, the same regarding the contribution of ₹2,000 per month in the form of deductions from the payables to the employees was never reflected in the settlement.
In response to queries sent by BusinessLine, the L&T spokesperson said, “Petitioner has been filing frivolous and baseless cases against L&T and its management in the past few years. Courts have already dismissed five of these cases including the Supreme Court in September 2013 and Bombay High Court in March 2018. L&T will suitably respond to the petition in the NCLT.
“The company is well within its rights to take appropriate legal action against any party wilfully maligning its reputation. As the matter is sub judice, we do not wish to comment on the specifics of the case.”
According to Dixit’s petition, employees were verbally informed in a general meeting of the union that some amount would be deducted from their salaries and equity shares of L&T for the deducted amount would be issued to the employees. However, employees were given shares of the Employee Welfare Pvt Ltd company.
There were more than 35,000 employees of L&T and through the foundation they were the largest shareholders of the company after the government.
“I have been trying to get answers to these questions from Naik, which is what I was trying to raise in the AGM. L&T has filed defamation cases against me in States including Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Bihar even though I am a long-time Mumbai resident,” Dixit told BusinessLine."

L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad Limited today commissioned a 16 km stretch of elevated metro, thereby completing one full stretch of the three corridor metro network.
With the commissioning of the stretch between Ameerpet and LB Nagar, the Hyderabad metro now has operational network of 45 km, making it the second longest metro line after New Delhi. Earlier, in November 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had commissioned a 29 km network across two corridors.
Flagging off the metro train and travelling in the rail, ESL Narasimhan, Governor of Telangana, called upon people to move away from personal transport and take to environment friendly metro rail network.
Later, he bicycled from Khairatabad station to Raj Bhavan along with KT Rama Rao, State Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development.
Narasimhan said, “I have travelled in many metros around the world and Hyderabad metro is one of the best. I hope that Hyderabadis will make full use of this world class facility and this will help make it a world class city.”
While the Governor called upon the concessionaire L&T to complete the stretch connecting Hitec City, the IT hub of Hyderabad by December 15, some right of way issues may delay the completion of this stretch by about couple of months, sources explained.
Cost hike
The Rs 14,132 crore Hyderabad metro rail, which is being developed under the public, private partnership (PPP) model, with the Centre pitching in with a viability gap funding (VGF) of Rs 1458 crore and the Telangana State Government investing about Rs 3000 crore for development of land acquisition and related infrastructure and right of way.
Following delays in right of way, the project cost is projected to shoot up by over Rs 3000 crore, which the concessionaire and the Government would have to sort out. Of the 72 km elevated metro rail across three dense corridors, two corridors will be fully completed by early next year. And the third corridor between Secunderabad and Old City, is likely to be delayed further, as a stretch of about 6 km that runs in the Old City beyond the Musi river is likely to be delayed, as it still faces right of way issues.
The Minister said “This was not just another metro in the making but a rejuvenation project for the world class city. While it has already received Platinum rating by the Indian Green Building Council, once its gets fully commissioned, it will transform the public transport network in the city.”
NVS Reddy, Managing Director of Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited, said, “Hyderabad metro is the second largest metro network after Delhi and the world's longest metro network under the PPP mode projects. It is a robust mass transit system which is being used to transform the city into a people friendly green city.”
KVB Reddy, MD and CEO of L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad Limited, said, “The metro marks the beginning of seamless commuting in Hyderabad. The inauguration of the 16 km stretch is another significant milestone in our endeavour.”"

Infrastructure major Larsen & Toubro has announced that its heavy civil infrastructure business has orders worth Rs 7,489 crore which includes two packages (1 and 4) of Mumbai Coastal Road Project developed by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai.
The work order involves the construction of parts of the Rs 15,000-crore coastal road project from Princess Street Flyover to Baroda Palace, including an underground tunnel, passing below Girgaum Chowpatty, Malabar Hills and Priyadarshini Park, the company said in a statement.
Package 4 involves the construction of a 3.93 Km stretch of coastal road from Princess Street Flyover to Priyadarshini Park. The scope of work includes construction of up and down ramps from Marine Drive connecting to the underground road (twin) tunnel which will pass below Girgaum Chowpatty, Malabar Hills and exit at Priyadarshini Park connecting to the Package 1 of the project.
Package 1 involves the construction of a 3.82 Km long, 8-lane highway over reclaimed land from Priyadarshini Park to Baroda Palace, including interchanges at Amarson Garden and Haji Ali. The Haji Ali interchange will be a multilevel interchange inside Haji Ali bay providing connectivity to the existing Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan Road.
According to L&T, the project involving sea front development would be the first of such kind in India. Earlier this year, another infrastructure major Hindustan Construction Company through a joint venture with Hyundai Development Company has emerged as the front-runner in the tender for Mumbai Coastal Road Package-2. 
The Rs 7,000-crore contract for the 17 km Bandra-Versova sea-link, which will eventually become a part of the total coastal road project and that is handled separately by Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation, was recently awarded to Reliance Infrastructure.
In addition to the coastal road packages, L&T’s Heavy Civil Infrastructure has also received a major variation order from the Irrigation and Command Area Development Department, Government of Telangana, for the Medigadda Barrage Project.

RITES Ltd has started leasing locomotives to construction major L&T, which uses them to haul material for building the dedicated rail freight corridor. RITES, the only player in the wet leasing space, offers train engines with drivers and maintenance.
RITES, a government-owned publicly listed consultancy company with expertise in transport and engineering space, has supplied almost 50 locomotives to various customers. These are provided on long-term lease with the contract reviewed every two years.
Besides L&T, its customers include the port trusts of Dhamra, Paradip and Visakhapatnam, and power and steel plants.
“We are the the only player providing high horse power (HP) locomotives on wet leasing, that is providing engines to customers with drivers and maintenance. All are diesel locomotives of 2,300 HP or 1,350 HP. The use them for shunting purposes,” Rajeev Mehrotra, CMD, RITES Ltd, told BusinessLine.
“Forty-six locomotives are already running, three more will be added soon, and some more orders are being placed. We have around 20 customers. These are long-term contracts, which are normally entered into for two years and renewed,” said Mehrotra, adding that L&T is also using leased the locomotives for construction of the Western Freight Corridor.
RITES will use the Chennai Port to ship the trial order of a locomotive and a set of diesel multiple unit (DMU) coaches to Sri Lanka. These are exports, not on lease.
“The first train engine of 3,000 HP, which is a prototype as per customer requirement, was shipped from Diesel Locomotive Works, Varanasi, about ten days back.
“The Integral Coach Factory, Chennai, also delivered one diesel multiple unit trainset of 13 coaches earlier this week,” said Mehrotra. The engine was taken from Varanasi to Chennai travelled on a truck by road.
“RITES’ order book includes ten locomotives, six DMUs and 160 AC and non-AC coaches to Sri Lanka over the next two years. These exports are against a line-of-credit from India to Sri Lanka,” he added.

Thanks to recent gains in its stock, the outlook for Larsen & Toubro has turned positive. The stock now finds an immediate support at ₹1,312, and only a decisive fall below ₹1,225 will alter the current bullish outlook. If the current trend sustains, the stock could climb to ₹1,625 and then to ₹1,800. We expect the stock to maintain the positive momentum. 
F&O Pointers: L&T witnessed a rollover of just 5 per cent to December series, signalling that investors are still cautious. However, option trading signals a positive bias, as puts added open positions while calls saw unwinding of positions.
Strategy: Traders could consider a calendar bull-call spread on L&T, using ₹1,420 strike. Traders should sell the current month ₹1,420-call and simultaneously buy ₹1,420-December call. These options closed with a premium of ₹8 and ₹35.40, which means one has to shell out ₹10,275 as the market lot is 375 shares per contract. The maximum loss one can suffer in this strategy is the premium paid (₹10,275) and this will happen if L&T closes below ₹1,420 at the time of December expiry.
However, profit is unlimited if the stock remains weak in the current series and rises sharply next month. Exit the position if loss mounts to ₹7,200 or at a profit of ₹12,000. Hold the position for at least three weeks. This strategy is for traders who have a risk-taking ability.
Follow-up: Though last week’s position on Bharti Airtel turned negative, we advise traders to hold till expiry."

 In a regulatory filing to stock exchanges, L&T Saturday said Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has asked it not to proceed with the buyback.
 “Since the ratio of the aggregate of secured and unsecured debts owed by the company after buy-back (assuming full acceptance) would be more than twice the paid-up capital and free reserves of the company based on consolidated financial statements”, the buyback offer is not in compliance with the Companies Act and SEBI norms, the regulator said in a letter to the company.
 Reacting to the development shares of the company opened on a weak note at Rs 1,275, then fell further to Rs 1,275, down 3.28 per cent over its previous closing price.
 “We estimate that the scrapping of the buyback could impact our return on equity (ROE) estimates by 150-165 basis point over FY20/21F,” Japanese brokerage major Nomura said in a research note.
 The shares witnessed a similar trend on the NSE as well, where the stock opened at Rs 1,279, then touched a low of Rs 1,273.45, down 3.37 per cent over its last close.
 L&T had proposed to buy back up to 6.1 crore shares from shareholders at a price of Rs 1,475 per equity share, aggregating to Rs 9,000 crore. The offer was open to those holding equity shares as on October 15.

Mindtree founders too asked their senior managers to stay focussed on work and not bother with what’s going on with regard to the hostile takeover bid, sources said. “Overall it is only an emotional battle for now. It is a parent trying to protect,” said a senior manager at Mindtree.
In the telecon with CEO, emotions were running high among senior managers as they were worried about their roles if L&T succeeds in acquiring a larger stake. However, as of now, all of the senior managers are showing commitment to management but the overall sentiment is that of “what does it mean to me or the employees?”
The takeover bid was an emotional issue not only for the management but also for the employees. There is no immediate visibility or threat of attrition at the senior managers level but everything depends on how this develops in the next few weeks to months, said a senior company official, who was on the call but did not want to be identified. Feelings are mixed among employees and senior management. The current strategy is on getting shareholders’ commitment and focus on work, he added.

Subrahmanyan said VG Siddhartha, Founder of Cafe Coffee Day, and a 20.3-per cent stakeholder in Mindtree since its inception, approached the firm a few months back to sell his stake in Mindtree and saw L&T as the best fit.
“About six years back I am told the present management of Mindtree, founders, approached the management at that time at L&T and said ‘Can you buy our stake’. We did not show interest for two reasons, Siddhartha was not supportive at that time and second, I think we didn’t have the bandwidth to do it,” Subrahmanyan told BusinessLine in an interview.
“Today we are much different, we have also evolved and grown over the period of time. It was through a mutual friend that Siddhartha whom I knew long time back came and contacted me and said SNS, I have 21 per cent, would you like to take a look at it. We were neutral at that time because we had not thought about anything like that. But then he kept on persuading me and pursuing... at one points of time, when somebody comes three-four times... one started looking at it,” Subrahmanyan said.
L&T then met with Mindtree management a few times and tried to convince them about the acquisition but emotions got the better of them and they did not agree to the proposition, he said.
He said L&T will pursue the acquisition and ensure that it gets at least 26 per cent stake in Mindtree.
“Once you go into it, I can’t be an investor, we are not, we need to have some 26 per cent and over a period of time acquire more and our intention is to keep that company absolutely independent,” Subrahmanyan said.
L&T made a ₹10,733-crore bid on Monday with a three-pronged strategy that includes paying ₹980 a share for a 20.3 per cent stake with Siddhartha; buying 15 per cent from the public; and making an open offer at ₹980 a share post the approval of Siddhartha’s stake buy that could take 30-40 days. If the plan goes ahead, that’ll get L&T 67 per cent equity in Mindtree for ₹10,733 crore.
The promoter group holds a 13.3 per cent stake in Mindtree, leaving them with little option to counter the L&T offer. They’ve already lost the opportunity to buy out Siddhartha’s stakes.
L&T is among the top players in most of the sectors that it’s present in, with the exception of IT services where it is not even among the top five. The company hopes that the acquisition will allow it to move up the ladder and get access to larger deals, which are currently dominated by a select few.
Meanwhile, Mindtree’s co-founders went on the offensive, saying that if L&T proceeds with its hostile bid, clients and employees will walk away without any hesitation.
“A hostile takeover by Larsen and Toubro, unprecedented in our industry, could undo all of the progress we’ve made and immensely set our organisation back,” the promoters of MindTree said in a statement which was read out at a press conference jointly addressed by co-founders Krishnakumar Natarajan, Subroto Bagchi and Rostow Ravanan.
The co-founders also seemed upset at Siddhartha selling his stake. Expressing surprise at the decision, CEO Ravanan said, “A shareholder cannot put a company at risk.”"

Shares of IT services company Mindtree Ltd and conglomerate Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) fell on Tuesday after L&T said it agreed to buy a fifth of Mindtree and aimed for a much bigger stake via market deals and an open offer.
The Mindtree stocks ended lower by 2.03 per cent in the BSE index Sensex at Rs 943, while the stock of L&T Ltd ended lower at 1,356.75 down 1.6 per cent.
L&T said it would buy a 20.32 per cent stake in Mindtree from coffee baron V G Siddhartha and companies related to him - Coffee Day Enterprises and Coffee Day Trading.
Mumbai-based L&T said it placed an order with its broker for an on-market purchase of up to 15 percent of Mindtree's shares at 980 rupees each. It is looking for an additional 31 percent stake from Mindtree's public shareholders at the same price.
“The attempted hostile takeover bid ... is a grave threat to the unique organization we have collectively built over 20 years,” the promoters of Mindtree said in a statement. “We don't see any strategic advantage in the transaction and strongly believe that the transaction will be value destructive for all shareholders.”
However, some analysts were slightly more optimistic given the deal did not involve the integration of Mindtree into L&T. “While a hypothetical 'delayed' merger will have different dynamics based on its contours, it should not be as negative as an immediate merger for the combined firm,” said Sudheer Guntupalli, an analyst with Ambit Capital in Mumbai.
The conglomerate will pay Rs 980 per Mindtree share, valuing the stake at 32.69 billion rupees ($477.1 million), L&T said late on Monday.
If the deals go through, L&T will be spending up to 107.3 billion rupees to buy around 66 percent stake in Mindtree, L&T said in an investor presentation on Tuesday, adding that it would fund the transactions entirely. Mindtree will continue to operate as an independent listed entity post the acquisition, L&T said.
L&T already owns a 74.8 per cent stake in IT consultancy firm Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd. L&T's deal is at premium of 1.8 per cent to Mindtree's closing price of Rs 962.50 on Monday. Local media reported about the potential stake deal over the weekend."

 The promoters of IT company Mindtree have vowed that they would unconditionally oppose the attempted hostile takeover bid by Larsen and Toubro, and dubbed it a grave threat to the organisation. “A hostile takeover by Larsen and Toubro, unprecedented in our industry, could undo all of the progress we’ve made and immensely set our organisation back,” the promoters said in a statement Tuesday.
The attempted hostile takeover bid of Mindtree by Larsen & Toubro is a “grave threat” and “value destructive” to the organisation collectively built over 20 years, the promoters said pledging to “unconditionally oppose” the hostile takeover attempt.
In the statement, the promoters -- Krishnakumar Natarajan (executive chairman), Subroto Bagchi (co-founder), Rostow Ravanan (CEO) and Parthasarathy N S (executive vice chairman and COO) -- went on to outline the move’s potential “negative consequences to corporate culture, client relationships, employee retention.”
“We don’t see any strategic advantage in the transaction and strongly believe that the transaction will be value destructive for all shareholders. Our collective success depends on building and nurturing relationships with our clients and partners,” it said.
They added that “this unexplainable transaction will bring disruption to those relationships and impair Mindtree’s ability to differentiate itself in the market and continue to deliver client value and great shareholder return.”
Promising their full commitment to long-term vision of building an independent company, the statement by promoters said that they firmly “believe it is in the best interests of our shareholders...and our organisation overall to continue opposing this takeover attempt.”
Mounting the country’s first hostile takeover bid in the IT sector, infrastructure giant Larsen and Toubro on Monday made an offer to buy up to 66 per cent stake in the Mindtree for around Rs 10,800 crore. L&T has entered into a deal to buy Cafe Coffee Day owner V G Siddhartha’s 20.32 per cent stake in Mindtree and has also placed an order with brokers to pick up another 15 per cent of the company shares from the open market. Subsequent to these deals, L&T would make an open offer to buy additional 31 per cent stake through an open offer."

For a company that thwarted a takeover bid in the late 1980s, life has come a full circle for L&T as it girds to acquire IT services firm Mindtree. BusinessLine met L&T CEO SN Subrahmanyan (SNS) and R Shankar Raman (RSR), Wholetime Director and Chief Financial Officer, to understand why the deal matters. Excerpts:
Way back, L&T itself was a target of a takeover. Now the role has reversed. Is there a change in how L&T looks at takeovers or is everything fair in business?
SNS: About six years back I am told the present management of Mindtree, founders, approached the then L&T management and asked, “Can you buy our stake?”. We did not show interest for two reasons: Siddhartha was not supportive at that time and second, I think we didn’t have the bandwidth to do it. Today we are much different, we have also evolved and grown over the period of time. It was through a mutual friend that Siddhartha, whom I knew for a long time, came and contacted me and said I have 21 per cent would you like to take a look at it. We were neutral at that time because we have not thought about anything like that. But then he kept on persuading me and pursuing... at one point of time, when somebody comes three-four times... I started looking at it. So I did an analysis, we all went into all the details, we consulted people, we consulted our chairman, board, and we found it worth looking at, that’s when we got serious. This was rather hostility from that side rather than from my side that persuaded us to look at it.
We did have a dialogue with Mindtree management a few times, we did try to convince them, in the meeting they sounded convinced, but they would go back and have a different view.
RSR: Please do remember, back then a family was trying to own a professional organisation. Here is the case of two professional organisations trying to find the balance to sail together.
Watch: L&T CEO and CFO speak to BusinessLine
But did you look at other IT services? Is takeover a right route, why not M&A or acquisition?
SNS: We were not looking out. We were interested in tuck-in acquisitions and we continue to do that. It is a persuasion of a major shareholder which made us look into it. That’s the way we went upon it.
Once you go into it, we need to have some 26 per cent and over a period of time acquire more and our intention is to keep that company absolutely independent, run it as an independent company.
Does this deal help you to catch up with the big 5 in the Indian IT space?
SNS: If you see all of our businesses, we are either number one or number two. In IT we are far behind, we are 8th or something like that — both IT (L&T Infotech) and technology (L&T Technology) services put together.
Scale does matter in the world; otherwise clients don’t respect. So if we can move to six or five, it brings some respectability, as I keep saying, we’ll get a front seat at the NASSCOM meetings.
Secondly, please understand, when you grow up to $1 billion, your aspiration goes to $2 billion. And you can’t do $2 billion the way you did $1 billion — you have to step up. It means taking bigger contracts. If you are to get invited to $50-100 million contracts, you need to have a balance sheet to do it.
But if you don’t have connect with the existing management, how do you plan to work that?
SNS: When I first met my wife, I ran behind her, even today I call it love marriage, she calls it arranged marriage. We have been together for 31-32 years. That’s life. We will try to overcome hurdles as it comes, our intention is to be nice, good, our intention is to embrace.
Mindtree’s management point is if L&T needs scale, why not to build it?
RSR: If there is an opportunity for me to create value to Mindtree shareholders, to L&T shareholders, it makes a lot of sense for me to look at this opportunity closely... Now, the reactions this has generated come out of uncertainty, and mind is unstable when you are not sure how to adjust, these kind of immediate reactions come. These things will settle down.
SNS: We have not told the Mindtree management, “You are removed, we are going to merge.” I offered the management when we had private dinner multiple times and Krishnakumar is an iconic gentleman, I have greatest respect for people who start business and develop it because I’ve not been able to do that.
Globally, there is a trend that founders tend to exit once it gets acquired by somebody else...
RSR: You can’t appropriate talent and technology to x number of individuals. The successful leaders are those who institutionalise capabilities. I would be very worried if the company, after 20 years, is going to be dependent on some five individuals. The clients need to be very worried.
So in case you won’t be able to get around 50 per cent, would you still invest?
RSR: That is a done deal and no going back on that. What we are now supposed to do as a responsible company — build on it. We are not there looking for a seat at the table. And in most of our subsidiaries we own excess of 50 per cent. This is something that will not happen overnight. And, we are in for a long haul. We will gain respect. I am sure one day we will sit and talk about this as a case study of how two professional organisations can come together."
54,2019-03-20,Larsen,"Partly synergistic offer for Mindtree if merged with L&T
As the tussle for a controlling stake in Mindtree initiated by the engineering conglomerate L&T gets hotter, the management of the latter has reportedly indicated that even after taking a controlling stake, the software firm would operate as a standalone entity, at least as of now.
Be that as it may, if the company is eventually integrated with L&T Infotech at some point in the future, the latter is likely to find it beneficial, though only from a purely verticals’ synergy perspective — given that the key segments do not overlap. Another positive for L&T Infotech could be that the focus on digital offerings is very strong in the case of Mindtree.
But there are likely to be challenges on the financial and operation fronts, as L&T Infotech enjoys much better performance metrics and superior financials than what Mindtree does.
Mindtree’s key vertical is hi-tech & media (that contribute around 39.4 per cent of revenues), as that was the main segment in which the company started operating. In the case of L&T Infotech, BFSI (banking, financial services & insurance that account for 46.9 per cent of revenues) is the key sector of operation. Segments such as retail, manufacturing and consumer packaged goods (CPG) also could have synergies.
L&T Infotech has presence in energy & utilities, while Mindtree exited the segment a few years ago. In travel & hospitality, Mindtree has a fair execution track record. Thus, there is limited overlap in terms vertical spread and client base.
Mindtree derives nearly half its revenues from digital services, while for L&T Infotech the proportion is 37 per cent. Thus, L&T Infotech would be a beneficiary of Mindtree’s digital execution capabilities.
L&T Infotech enjoys a much higher scale of revenues than Mindtree, having crossed the $1-billion threshold a while back. Mindtree is yet to touch that mark (expected to this fiscal). L&T Infotech enjoys an EBITDA margin of 23.5 per cent, which is comparable with that of top-tier IT companies, while Mindtree’s margins hover around 15-16 per cent levels. Net margins, too, are much more impressive in the case of L&T Infotech.
Operationally, the utilisation rate for L&T Infotech is a high 83 per cent, while for Mindtree it is about 76.4 per cent. It thus appears that L&T Infotech maintains a much smaller bench strength; Mindtree, on the other hand, appears to have a larger proportion of unbilled resources. A higher utilisation rate also partly explains L&T Infotech’s superior margins.
Attrition is higher for L&T Infotech, indicating that Mindtree may have a better employee retention strategy than the former.
Despite the disparities in financials and operational parameters, the market views Mindtree as a premium catch. The trailing 12 months’ price-earnings multiple for Mindtree is at 21 times, while for L&T Infotech it is 20 times.
A merger, and a combined entity that mirrors L&T Infotech’s operational and financial profiles, may be a tough ask for the foreseeable future."

The Mindtree board has decided to defer a decision on its buyback plans following division among its members on whether the firm should bring in a white knight to stall L&T’s takeover bid or go ahead with its stated plan. In a filing to the exchanges, the company said that following detailed discussions, the meeting has been adjourned to a future date. p2"
52,2019-03-25,Larsen,"To thwart L&T bid, Mindtree founders seek wider counsel


 The co-founders of the beleaguered software services company, Mindtree are learnt to have reached out to Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani and former CFO Mohandas Pai to seek counsel on the next course of action they should take.
It is also learnt that there is also a possibility of taking their help in identifying investors who could act as white knight for the co-founders to thwart L&T’s takeover bid.
On March 20, Mindtree deferred its decision to buyback shares, as the board was still evaluating the possible options going forward. The new date for the Board meeting is March 26.
One of the reasons for this deferment, followed by reaching to the IT head honchos, has to do with looking at alternative options to counter the bid from L&T, according to sources in the know. The founders were also seeking the head honchos’ help in reaching out to PE firms or use their investment arms to invest in Mindtree. Both Nilekani and Pai have investments through either their family office or investment firms.
They have talked to them also regarding whether they can be the “white knight” or bring in one which would inspire confidence amongst other institutions who want to invest in the company but are kind of wary now, according to another source close to Mindtree.
The founders who hold 13.32 per cent in Mindtree are seeking a way to block L&T’s open offer at ₹980 per share, in addition to acquiring another 31 per cent, thereby acquiring a 66 per cent stake for a total of ₹10,733 crore. Their attempts to block the transaction through a buyback (which could push up the cost of acquisition as buybacks happen with a premium to existing investors) is unlikely.
As per Section 26 (2-d) of Substantial Acquisition of Shares & Takeover (SAST) Regulations of SEBI, after the public announcement of an open offer, the board of the target company shall not implement any buyback or make any change to the capital structure, unless the approval of shareholders is sought through a special resolution,” Shriram Subramanian, MD at InGovern Research Services, a proxy advisory services firm told BusinessLine. In the event of a buyback, L&T can block it through a special resolution.
Meanwhile the Mindtree Board, which apart from the founders consists of independent directors are looking at ways to ensure that Mindtree’s stand is not emotional or sentimental and done with a focus on its future and growth prospects.
 “The decision should not be emotional and the whole Board wants to be involved in the decision as the founders have made their stance clear,” said a source.
On March 20, some of the founders made an emotional appeal saying that this poses grave threat to the company and said that they do not see any strategic advantage and believe that this will be value destructive for all shareholders.
 Mindtree shares closed at ₹940, marginally up while L&T shares closed at ₹1,377, down 1.2 per cent."
51,2019-03-26,Larsen,"No buyback from Mindtree: Board
 
Mindtree board on Tuesday has decided not to proceed with a buyback of equity shares of the company hours after L&T posted its open offer to buy Mindtree shares. The Mindtree board has invited views from the directors on the unsolicited offer made by L&T for the equity shares of the Company, Mindtree said in a statement to BSE.
""After detailed deliberation and discussion, the board, at its meeting today, decided to immediately constitute the Committee of Independent Directors (IDC) in the interest of all stakeholders to provide their reasoned recommendation in respect of the unsolicited offer by L&T for the consideration of the shareholders,"" the statement said. All the Independent Directors will be Members of the IDC, and the IDC has elected Apurva Purohit, Lead Independent Director, as the Chairperson of the IDC and spokesperson.
The IDC will consider and evaluate all aspects of the unsolicited offer, taking into account all relevant facts, circumstances, data related to the company and industry and the interests of all stakeholders involved. Mindtree may still consider a counter open offer to foil L&T's bid to acquire the company. However, nothing in this regard was stated by the board.
Meanwhile, L&T has appointed Axis Bank and Citigroup Global are managers to its open offer to buy Mindtree shares at Rs 980 a piece. The issue will open on May 14 and close on May 27. L&T will acquire 5.13 crore equity shares of Mindtree for a total consideration of Rs 5,030 crore."
50,2019-03-27,Larsen,"Takeover drama 
With Larsen & Toubro (L&T) announcing an open offer to acquire a 31 per cent public shareholding in Mindtree, the melodrama over this takeover seems to giving way to a more reasoned response. Mindtree, which was toying with a share buyback plan to undermine this bid, has now dropped this idea and has set up a committee of independent directors to evaluate the offer. Hopefully, with this development, the L&T management and Mindtree promoters will cease their war of words on this issue and leave the decision to Mindtree’s public shareholders, who are the only entities who should be taking a call on the merits of this offer.
Mindtree’s founders have been vociferous in their opposition to L&T’s ‘hostile’ takeover bid, ever since L&T signalled its intent to acquire control after snapping up a 20.4 per cent equity stake from VG Siddhartha — Mindtree’s largest shareholder. L&T, which has two software services firms under its fold, sees the Mindtree acquisition as a good way to scale up its presence in the asset-light services space. It has cited the complementarity of its software portfolio with Mindtree’s as the key motivation for this takeover bid. Mindtree’s promoter shareholders, in contrast, have made no bones about the fact that they see L&T as a highly undesirable suitor. While the Mindtree promoters’ passion for the business they have built from ground up is understandable, the truth is that they have little locus standi to decide on behalf of Mindtree’s shareholders with a mere 13.3 per cent shareholding in the company. The founders are in fact doing the company more harm than good by making emotional appeals to Mindtree employees to ‘save the tree’ from L&T’s attempts to ‘chop it down’. Should L&T succeed in its open offer, a hostile workforce could render a seamless management transition difficult.
Now that the open offer has been announced, it is important that the Mindtree promoters distance themselves and allow the committee of independent directors to make objective recommendations to other shareholders. L&T, on its part, needs to lay all its cards on the table on its strategic plans for Mindtree. For public shareholders to take an informed decision, they will need to know if L&T plans to operate Mindtree as an independent entity or merge it. As long as this acquisition bid adheres to SEBI’s Takeover Code, there is no case for any regulatory intervention in the affair. In the past, takeover attempts at India Inc have often been foiled by promoters with large equity stakes over-ruling the minority and roping in white knights to thwart the acquirer. But with the promoter stranglehold on India Inc loosening, the market for corporate acquisitions is now poised for take-off. Regulators must do their best to encourage this, as a vibrant market for corporate control keeps promoters on their toes, promotes healthy competition for good assets and unlocks value for minority shareholders when a business is undervalued."

Engineering and construction conglomerate L&T is following the path of global giants such as GE, Siemens and ABB to go beyond infrastructure and offer industrial Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to help improve the efficiency of industrial units with the help of digital technologies.
It is launching a new initiative, L&T-Nxt, which will focus on artificial intelligence, IoT, virtual reality, augmented reality, geospatial solutions and cybersecurity, and leverage the experience that L&T has garnered over the decades. L&T-Nxt has been identified as a select initiative in L&T’s five-year strategic plan.
With this move, L&T intends to enter the elite group of global MNCs that not only build large infrastructure projects but also help other manufacturing and engineering companies improve efficiencies with the help of digital technologies. GE, for example, started ‘Industrial IoT’ back in 2012 and now expects the global potential of the business to be around $225 billion by 2020.
In India, IoT can present an opportunity of up to $12 billion. Industrial IoT is expected to represent a larger share of the market than consumer IOT, according to a report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India and Deloitte.
“When you use digital, you can ensure people are trained in skills quickly with the help of augmented reality and virtual reality tools. Other technologies use sensors to improve efficiencies in manufacturing plants,” JD Patil, Senior Executive Vice-President (Defence Business) and Member of the Board, L&T, told BusinessLine. “We have been doing this in-house so far to improve our efficiency but whenever we speak to customers, we see they are looking at efficiency enhancement as well. That’s where we thought we need to get our domain knowledge and digital experience that we’ve mastered internally and offer it as an additional offering.”
Patil said the company has been working to build these technologies for the past three or four years and already has a team of about 200 people. But now they’ll be expanding rapidly.
“Couple of thousand is what we’ll be looking to hire as of now. But in two years time, we could have a different number. There’s a huge amount of interest we’ve seen in the market for a holistic solution. One would build depending on the quantum of business,” Patil said.
L&T’s two listed IT services companies — L&T Infotech and L&T Technology Services — already offer several of these services to global clients. However, Patil said the new unit will remain independent of the two IT companies within the group and would look at not just services but also building out digital platforms for large manufacturing units, building hardware and software for them and also offering consulting services.
“LTI and LTS will continue to work with existing customers. The new unit will remain an independent unit. If we win a big contract, within L&T, we share each other’s resources. We obviously pay for that,” Patil said.
“Couple of thousand is what we'll be looking to hire (for L&T-Nxt) as of now.”

47,2019-04-07,Larsen,"Hostile takeover of Mindtree by L&T: What investors should do?
P Saravanan/V Gopal
Larsen and Toubro (L&T) is all set for a hostile takeover of Mindtree. L&T has already entered into an agreement with VG Siddhartha (founder of Café Coffee Day and one of the early investors in Mindtree) to buy his 20.30 per cent stake in Mindtree at ₹980 per share.
It has also placed an order with its broker for on-market purchase of up to 15 per cent of shares in Mindtree. But, the other promoters of Mindtree — Krishnakumar Natarajan, Subroto Bagchi, NS Parthasarathy and Rostow Ravanan — who hold 13 per cent stake are fighting hard to retain control of the company. Is L&T’s bid advantageous to the share holders?
Under a hostile takeover, one company (acquirer) acquires another company (target) by making a tender offer directly to the target company’s shareholders. When the board of directors of the firm that is being acquired oppose the takeover bid, it is called as hostile takeover.
Currently, L&T is sitting on huge cash reserves of ₹15,000 crore and is on the lookout for acquisitions. Sometime ago, L&T had planned a share buyback, which was stalled by the regulators for various reasons.
So, the company now wants to utilise the cash reserves by acquiring Mindtree.
In acquiring Mindtree, L&T sees synergies with L&T Infotech, its listed group company in the IT space.
This acquisition is expected to expand its IT service business and increase value for L&T Infotech’s shareholders.
But why are the Mindtree promoters opposed to the takeover? It is a classic case of promoters or founders not being able to give up their emotional connect with the company. This is a common feature among many first-generation entrepreneurs. Promoters view their companies as their creation. Primarily, this is an emotional reaction to the deal. However, recently Mindtree formed a panel to evaluate the open offer and the deal will most likely go through.
L&T’s plans of using its cash reserves for an acquisition in a non-core business, raises questions about judicious capital allocation. Shareholders might have concerns on whether their (shareholder) value can be enhanced by buying a non-core business. Alternatively, by acquiring Mindtree, L&T may be looking to smoothen the cash flows of L&T Infotech by increasing the scope of their offering in the infotech space. If L&T can handle the cultural issues of the takeover and are able to manage the product portfolio, the shareholders may actually gain.
Public shareholding in Mindtree is more than 80 per cent. As L&T is making an open offer for about 45 per cent of shares, institutional shareholders will play a major role in its success.
The choice now with retail shareholders is whether to accept and sell their shares in the open offer or not. L&T is making an open offer at ₹980 per share.
To conclude, L&T is offering a good exit opportunity to Mindtree shareholders as the valuations are on the higher side.
However, for L&T shareholders, they must keep in mind that an engineering and construction conglomerate is increasing its exposure to non-core businesses with the additional risks of integrating Mindtree and hostility from its promoters.

 Larsen & Toubro (L&T) on Thursday said it has purchased Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation Ltd’s (TIDCO) 3 per cent stake in its subsidiary L&T Shipbuilding Ltd for Rs 32.74 crore.
“The company has purchased the entire stake held by Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (TIDCO) in L&T Shipbuilding Ltd (LTSB), a subsidiary company, on April 10, 2019. TIDCO held 3 per cent stake in LTSB. The same has now been acquired by L&T, to make it a wholly owned subsidiary,” L&T said in a BSE filing.
L&T said it acquired TIDCO’s stake pursuant to exercise of a put option which TIDCO had on Larsen & Toubro Ltd which is the promoter of L&T Shipbuilding as agreed with TIDCO at the time of inception of L&T Shipbuilding.

45,2019-04-15,Larsen,"Will Mindtree fourth-quarter results impact L&T’s open offer?


Independent directors of Mindtree should ensure that the company presents the true picture while announcing the quarterly numbers and resist any move to influence the open offer made by L&T, proxy advisory firms say. Mindtree will announce fourth quarter results on April 17. 
“Irrespective of any merger, acquisition or open offer independent directors are duty-bound to approve or suggest in the best interest of the company and one that fits the law and governance standards,” said J N Gupta, former ED SEBI and founder promoter, Shareholder Empowerment Services, a proxy advisory firm.
“In the case of Mindtree, if the independent directors are under any pressure to act in a certain manner, they must resist and just approve what fits the law and is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,” Gupta added.
 “It is not the question of presenting a good or bad picture of a company to influence the open offer. The independent directors must be clear that a fair picture is presented,” Gupta added. 
Larsen & Toubro will offer ₹980 a share to buy additional 31 per cent shares in Mindtree in an open offer, scheduled to start on May 14 and close on May 27. 
Mindtree shares closed at ₹978 a share on Monday on the BSE. 
If the company announces a good set of numbers, in line with the growth seen by TCS and Infosys, its share price could rise above the L&T offer price.
“The board of directors, the audit committee, and of course, the auditors of Mindtree, must be particularly alert to ensure that the revenue recognition during the January-March, 2019 quarter is appropriately done,” said an accounting expert.
“Considering the nature of the open offer and the current pricing being close to the open offer price, the fiduciary obligations of the board and the audit committee becomes very critical,” the expert added. 
An Indian IT outsourcing entity may undertake preparatory activity and incur costs before getting into a steady state of providing the outsourcing service. It may also receive fees for such activity. 
Under the Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 115, this may not qualify for upfront revenue recognition since the customer may not separately benefit from such activity. 
Consequently, revenue for such fees may be deferred, including related incremental costs subject to recoverability. 
These rules are more stringent and leave lesser room for manoeuvering than before in the hands of the management, the expert added."

L&T Infrastructure Debt Fund (L&T IDF), a subsidiary of L&T Finance Holdings Ltd (LTFH), has entered into an agreement with private equity fund Apis Partners to raise $110 million in lieu of a 25.1 per cent stake.
Of the total investment, 70 per cent is growth capital for L&T IDF, while 30 per cent would be used to purchase shares from existing shareholders, the company said in a statement.
Apis Partners will make the investment through one of its funds, Apis Growth Fund II. LTFH, an infrastructure refinancing firm, is part of engineering and infrastructure conglomerate, Larsen & Toubro Group.
“The fund’s investment will support the company in its mission to facilitate infrastructure growth, a critical factor for the development of industry, agriculture and trade in emerging markets,” Matteo Stefanel, co-founder and Managing Partner at Apis Partners said, adding, India is projected to be the fastest growing infrastructure market over the next five years.
The fund’s investment in L&T IDF will support the growth of its loan book focused on infrastructure projects in India, strengthen its capital structure, and further its technology and digitisation strategy. This long-term partnership will support the company in accessing low-cost international sources of funds, which will be utilised to refinance operational infrastructure projects in India, it added.
L&T IDF provides long-term refinancing to private sector and public-private partnership infrastructure projects across sectors such as alternative energy projects, solar and wind, and highways.
“The India infrastructure market offers significant growth opportunities for specialised re-financiers such as ourselves.

The project cost, which has increased to ₹18,975 crore, will require additional funds of ₹2,600 crore
   -  Nagara Gopal


 Construction major L&T, the concessionaire implementing the ₹16,375-crore Hyderabad metro rail project through an SPV, is faced with a cost overrun of about 16 per cent due to project delay and delay in securing the right of way in the Old City segment. 
The project cost, which has increased to ₹18,975 crore, will require additional funds of ₹2,600 crore and L&T will have to pump in additional equity of ₹800 crore. 
Of the three corridors, two have been fully completed, and the work on the third corridor connecting Secunderabad with the Old City is now under way. 
However, work on a stretch of about 6 km that goes beyond the Musi river and connects the Falaknuma, is still languishing. 
India Ratings & Research has affirmed the loans of L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) Limited at IND BBB+, Outlook Stable.
In its rating report, the Fitch Group company said, “A significant increase in debt, higher than the original estimated, could further stress the cash flows an impact the debt coverage metrics. 
The sponsor L&T is expected to bridge the additional fund requirement on a timely basis to complete the project within the stipulated timelines.”
According to Lenders Independent Engineer report, there has been no decision regarding the construction of the line that passes through the Old City. Since the project involves a number of specialised global vendors, this delay is seen as adding to cost escalations.
In its report, the rating firm also sought to mention that further delay in project completion, non realisation of transit oriented development by October 2018, lack of clarity on the tie up of funds for the cost overruns, could result in rating downgrade.
As of December 2018, L&TMRHL has injected equity of ₹2,427 crore into the project and the total loan drawn was ₹10,759 crore. It has raised ₹1,000 crore through NCDs as a part of debt and the project received 83 per cent of ₹1,458 crore viability gap funding.
While the SPV is entitled to transit oriented development, the revenue model has gone through a change. As opposed to recurring rental income, it is now a monetisation approach. 
The commercial operations date has been extended by three months from April 2019 to July 2019. 
As per the concession agreement, the project finance package entails the need to provide equity of 21 per cent of the project cost and meet up to 5 per cent of the project cost overrun and also provide cash support during th operation phase. 
Of the 72-km three corridor elevated metro line, thus far a stretch of about 56 km across two lines, including one connecting to the IT hub of Hitec City is ready and the work on the third one line minus the Old City is at advanced stage."

 Infrastructure major Larsen and Toubro (L&T) has acquired 1,168 shares of Mindtree from the open market, taking its overall holding in the mid-sized IT company to 25.94 per cent, according to a regulatory filing.
“Larsen and Toubro Ltd has acquired 1,168 equity shares (with face value of Rs 10 each) of Mindtree Ltd on May 14, 2019,” the company said in a filing.
 The mode of the acquisition was open market purchases and L&T’s holding after the said purchase stood at 25.94 per cent. The latest stock purchase was made at Rs 972 apiece. 
Earlier this month, Larsen and Toubro had purchased around 20 per cent stake of V G Siddhartha and Coffee Day in Mindtree through a block deal for about Rs 3,210 crore, and has since topped that up with share purchases from the open market. 
On May 9, L&T had announced the acquisition of an additional 2 per cent stake in Mindtree. 
In all, the infrastructure major is eyeing up to 66 per cent stake in Mindtree for around Rs 10,800 crore -- marking the country’s first-ever hostile takeover bid in the IT industry. 
 L&T had proposed to buy additional stake in Mindtree through an open offer that was slated to begin on May 14 and close on May 27. 
However, the open offer seems to have been postponed as the engineering major is yet to get a nod on the same from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Reports suggest that the offer could be delayed by a fortnight. Emails sent to L&T on the issue did not elicit a response.

L&T’s open offer to Mindtree shareholders may further get delayed as regulator SEBI is scrutinising the conditions around the open offer. Sources close to the market regulator as well as L&T told BusinessLine that the open offer to acquire 31 per cent of Mindtree shares from the open market is likely to get delayed further.
According to SEBI’s Substantial Acquisition of Shares & Takeovers (SAST) Regulations, a company can trigger the open offer only when it has crossed the threshold of 25 per cent voting rights.
“It is clear that the regulator is looking at whether L&T can trigger an open offer since at the time of making the (open offer) announcement, it held less than 25 per cent in Mindtree, which seems to have grabbed the regulator’s attention” said a source. SEBI did not respond to the comments.
On March 26, L&T had provided a public statement on the open offer to the shareholders of Mindtree.
Mindtree said it has asked for clarification from SEBI on the legality of such an offer.
BusinessLine had recently reported that L&T is expected to mop up 10 per cent more stake only through the open offer route as shareholders of Mindtree expect a sweetened offer. An email sent to L&T did not elicit a response.
JN Gupta, founder, Stakeholder Empowerment Services (SES) and a former director at SEBI in a report said open offer gets triggered only if an order placed with the broker crosses the threshold of 25 per cent voting rights, which L&T did not have at the time of launch of the offer. Mindtree has also written to SEBI seeking clarification on whether this offer is “legally valid”.
Another source said that while it is unclear why the regulator is looking at all these things, one of the reasons could be that it is evaluating all possible scenarios from a legal standpoint before giving its nod, as this could set a precedent for other such takeovers.
Industry watchers point out that the regulator needs to act fast. “The more there are delays, it will have a negative impact on the acquisition itself,” said Shriram Subramanian, MD, InGovern.
In a normal buyout case, an acquirer would acquire shares from the open market and if regulatory approvals are not received, the acquirer would hold the shares with an option to either hold or dispose it. “Whereas in a conditional offer (like this), risks generally get transferred to other stakeholders and the acquirer may not be taking any risks. In the present case, the acquirer may not be taking that risk,” noted Gupta.
Since the time L&T publicly stated its intent to acquire Mindtree, the latter has been vehemently opposing this buyout stating that it will erode shareholder value across both the firms, in addition to destroying Mindtree, which reached the $1-billion revenue milestone at the end of fiscal 2019.
Meanwhile, as L&T awaits clearance for the open offer, it has raised its stake by about 2 per cent between May 20 and 24 by picking up shares worth over ₹316 crore, according to data."

 Infrastructure major Larsen and Toubro on Thursday acquired 25,000 equity shares of Mindtree Ltd, taking its total holding in the mid-tier IT firm to 28.90 per cent, as per a regulatory filing.
 The development assumes significance as L&T has been steadily increasing its holding in the Bengaluru-based tech firm where it acquired around 20 per cent stake of V G Siddhartha and Cafe Coffee Day, recently. L&T, which has been pursuing a hostile takeover of Mindtree, has expressed its intent to ramp-up its shareholding up to 66 per cent.
 “This is to inform you that Larsen and Toubro Ltd has acquired 25,000 equity shares (with face value of Rs 10 each) of Mindtree Ltd on June 6, 2019,” L&T said in a regulatory filing. The shares were purchased at Rs 971.03 a piece from the open market. A rough calculation showed that the company spent close to Rs 2.43 crore for these transaction. Following the transaction, the L&T’s holding increased to 28.90 per cent (or 4.74 crore shares) against the previous 28.88 per cent, it said.

L&T has come up with an open offer to acquire 31 per cent in IT services firm Mindtree for ₹5,029 crore.
The price of the open offer is expected to be the same as before — ₹980 per share — which was announced when L&T became the majority shareholder in the Bengaluru-based mid-sized company by acquiring VG Siddhartha’s 20.32 per cent stake for ₹3,300 crore. The tendering period starts from June 17 and will end on July 12, L&T said in a filing with the exchanges.
By making this open offer, L&T intends to own around 66 per cent in Mindtree. This development comes a month after L&T was scheduled to have made its offer to Mindtree shareholders. So far, L&T has mopped up close to 29 per cent in Mindtree, and with the 31 per cent bid, it will take its total shareholding to 60 per cent.
SEBI’s nod comes at a time when the regulator is learnt to be scrutinising the conditions around L&T’s open offer, which Mindtree promoters had contested.
As per SEBI’s Substantial Acquisition of Shares & Takeovers (SAST) regulations, a company can trigger the open offer only when it crosses the threshold of 25 per cent voting rights. Mindtree had sought a clarification from SEBI on the legality of such an offer, as it believed L&T did not have the required stake.
Once the threshold is reached, the acquiring company must make an offer to the existing shareholders to buy an additional 20 per cent stake in the acquiree company.
Since the news of the open offer first came up, Mindtree has set up a committee consisting of four Independent Directors as per SAST regulations, to weigh in on the offer.

   -  Bijoy Ghosh


 Mindtree — where Larsen & Toubro is in the midst of acquiring majority stake — has exuded confidence that it will deliver a low-teen growth rate in FY20, and promised that the “best of Mindtree is yet to come”.
The Bengaluru-based company described construction major L&T’s unsolicited bid to acquire majority holding in the IT firm as “unusual situation” and said it is fully committed to “handling this issue in a manner that maximises value for all our stakeholders“.
Chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan and CEO Rostow Ravanan, in their message to shareholders in the company’s annual report filed with BSE on Friday, noted that the L&T matter was pending regulatory approvals at the time of penning the message.
 The two top officials said the company is focussed on capitalising on the opportunities and maintaining high-growth trajectory, growing faster than the industry.
“Although the external environment presents a slightly worrisome picture — global trade wars, increasing risk of terrorism disrupting people’s lives, slowing economic growth, and political uncertainty — we are confident that we are better prepared to handle these uncertainties than ever before.
“We estimate that we will deliver a low-teen growth rate in FY20, along with a margin expansion of 100-120 bps,” they said. In March, L&T had said it will buy 20.32 per cent stake in Mindtree from VG Siddhartha and his coffee enterprise for over ₹3,000 crore - marking India’s first-ever hostile takeover bid in the IT space.
 Since then, L&T has steadily increased its holding in the Bengaluru-based tech firm to about 30 per cent. It is currently in the process of an open offer to buy an additional 31 per cent stake. In all, the infrastructure major is eyeing about 66 per cent stake in Mindtree for over ₹10,700 crore.
 The open offer — with an offer price of ₹980 per share — commenced on June 17 and is slated to close on June 28. If the offer is subscribed fully, the engineering behemoth will end up with a 66.32 per cent holding in Mindtree. L&T has secured three board positions at the IT services firm, giving the former a firm control over the company.
Mindtree has been in the spotlight since early part of this year due to the takeover saga, and more recently when its Board in mid-April proposed to pay a special dividend to shareholders, including promoters, that along with regular dividend and tax components would strip the mid-sized IT firm of about ₹530 crore.
In the latest annual report, Natarajan and Ravanan stressed on the importance of rigorous governance standards as essential ingredient to deliver sustainable financial performance.
“You have our unequivocal commitment to uphold the highest standards of transparency and governance in Mindtree,” they said.
 They also admitted that some aspects needed improvement and two such high-priority areas included improving current margin levels which are currently below its expectations, and enhancing gender pay parity."

L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) Limited (L&TMRHL) has planned captive solar plants with a capacity of approximately 8 mega watt peak (MWp) in Metro depots and on station rooftops.
The company expects solar units to meet 15 per cent of the total electrical consumption.
As on date, 3 MWp has been commissioned and another 1 MWp is ready for commissioning.
DVS Raju, the Chief Electrical Inspector to Government of India (CEIG) for Hyderabad Metro Rail Project, inspected the 1MWp Solar Installation at HMR-Uppal Depot and related 0.54/33 KV power evacuation substation.
This plant has been developed on RESCO (Renewable Energy Service Company) model by Ampsolar Generation Private Limited, through a power purchase agreement with L&T MRHL.
Upon successful inspection and grant of sanction from the CEIG, the operational solar plant capacity in Hyderabad Metro Rail premises at Uppal Depot will be 4 MWp. This is expected to generate approximately 18000 units energy per day and shall form 8 per cent of the total energy demand.
DVS. Raju said, “It is a great initiative to tap renewable potential to reduce carbon footprint.”
KVB Reddy, MD & CEO, L&TMRHL said, “This shall be a milestone in achieving sustainability objectives of the project. Installation activities on other sites are in full swing and the metro is expected to achieve 8 MWp capacity of solar installation by the end of the year. With this solar plant commissioning, both Uppal and Miyapur depots shall become power surplus.”
The metro is implementing an elevated network of rails across three dense corridors. About 66 km of the 72 metro will be fully operational by the fourth quarter of the this year, barring the Old City link."

 L&T has reported revenue growth on the back of fresh orders, even as it said that the private sector investments look subdued in the next 15-18 months.
Addressing reporters on its first quarter performance, SN Subrahmanyan, CEO & MD, said: “Don’t see businesses adding capacity even if they want to. Availability of liquidity is a question,” he said.
While the sentiment in the industry is low, L&T’s results have been good, especially since the management had said in the March-ended quarter that it expects a modest start to the first half of 2019-20.
For the first quarter of 2020 fiscal, L&T reported consolidated profits of ₹1,473 crore — a 21.2-per cent increase compared to the ₹1,215 crore it posted in the same period last year. 
Revenues for the quarter grew by 10.2 per centto ₹30,020 crore (₹27,232 crore).
The engineering conglomerate giant, which has interests from infrastructure to software services, bagged new orders worth ₹38,700 crore — a 11-per cent growth. International orders came in at ₹9,005 crore, constituting 23 per cent of the total order flow. 
At operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 20.4 per cent to ₹3,319 crore and margin expanded 100 basis points to 11.2 per cent compared to the year-ago period.
 
The infrastructure segment clocked revenues of ₹18,865 crore posting a 14 per cent year-on-year growth. However, EBITDA margins for the segment went down marginally from 6.8 to 6.4 per cent. 
This, Subrahmanyan said, was due to job mix and seasonality of execution.
Power segment bagged orders worth ₹6,700 crore, comprising a domestic order for a 2x660 MW ultra-supercritical thermal power plant in Buxar, Bihar. This resulted in an increase in the order book to ₹12,933 crore. 
Despite this heavy order book, the power sector clocked revenues of ₹561 crore — a decrease of 48 per cent on a year-on-year basis. 
“We expect sales to pick up from October,” said R Shankar Raman, CFO.
The hydrocarbon business recorded revenues of ₹3,763 crore — a 7 per cent yearly growth. Financial services segment clocked revenues of ₹3,462 crore posting a 13 per cent yearly growth driven by favourable outcome of NCLAT order in connection with IL&FS exposure and growth in loan assets.
Heavy engineering segment’s revenues almost doubled to ₹874 crore. “We saw execution momentum in oil and gas, and fertiliser and petrochemical projects,” said Raman. 
The IT and Technology Services business saw a 15 per cent growth of revenues to ₹3,819 crore, on the back of all round business from L&T Infotech and L&T Technology Services. Also, in the last three months, L&T has upped its shareholding in Mindtree to 60.59 per cent and is set to announce the new CEO on August 2.
Defence engineering segment registered a 33 per cent raise in revenues to ₹965 crore. This segment bagged orders worth ₹443 crore. 
During the quarter, the Competition Commission of India had given the nod for Schneider Electric to buy L&T’s electrical and automation business and the sale is likely to be completed in 12 months This has been classified as discontinued business."
22,2019-08-19,Larsen,"L&T sees growth in desalination projects 
L&T’s water and effluent treatment business is eyeing a slew of desalination and water treatment projects worth $1 billion in the country.
The business, which is undertaken by L&T Construction in partnership with UAE-based Tecton Engineering and Construction, is seeing significant demand mostly from coastal regions. “Coastal regions in India from the South, the East and the North-West are looking at desalination plants as an option to reduce the stress on municipal corporations,” S Rajavel, Head of the Water and Effluent Treatment business, L&T, told BusinessLine. He, however, did not specify the time-frame of these expected projects.
L&T is particularly upbeat about this business as it has been seeing some momentum recently. In the past couple of months, the firm has bagged two such orders. It bagged a contract for a desalination plant from the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC). While it did not disclose the value of the contract, it said the order falls under the “significant” category which ranges between ₹1,000 crore and ₹2,500 crore as per the firm’s classification of contracts.
Similarly, in June, L&T Construction bagged an EPC (engineering procurement construction) order from the Delhi Jal Board for the design, construction, installation, automation, testing, commissioning and O&M (operation and maintenance) of a 477 MLD (million litres per day) water treatment plant (WTP), a 105 ML clear-water reservoir, and a pump house for the Chandrawal command area. The project is part of the Delhi Water Supply Improvement Project and is funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency.
Rajavel believes that many factors are contributing to this upsurge in water-treatment initiatives, which is a $2-billion business for the company at present. “Rising shortage of ground water, rapid urbanisation and expansion of industrial activities have all put a strain on municipal corporations’ ability to meet the water demand,” he said.
With conventional surface-water sources drying up or disappearing over time and borewells getting deeper by the year, sourcing and supplying water have become uphill tasks for corporations and panchayats, he added. Also, L&T considers water resource management projects as one of its key growth areas, something which Chairman AM Naik outlined in the company’s recent annual report.
Some State governments such as Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Gujarat have opted for setting up desalination plants to address water shortage. “From our interactions, States are exploring desalination plants on western coasts,” said Rajavel. Odisha has signed an MoU with Paradip Port Trust (PPT) and the National Institute of Ocean Technology for its first desalination plant with a capacity of 10 MLD.
According to the International Desalination Association (IDA), there are around 18,426 desalination plants spread across 150 countries, touching around 300 million people.
States are also looking at L&T as it has done similar projects abroad, particularly in West Asian countries such as the UAE, Oman and Qatar. As an example, Rajavel points to the completion of a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in the UAE along with its JV partner BESIX. The 375,000-cubic meters per day STP in Jebel Ali (Phase 2) claims to be the biggest in the UAE.
However, some industry watchers have questioned the economic viability of desalination plants, terming it as expensive and not environmentally sustainable, as they are energy intensive."
20,2019-08-23,Larsen,"Broker's call: L&T (Buy)
Motilal Oswal 
L&T (Buy)
CMP: ₹1,287
Target: ₹1,800
To start with, there is no major tax arbitrage on share buyback versus the dividend payout option now. The latest union Budget proposed 20 per cent tax on buyback of shares, thus doing away with the tax arbitrage between dividend payout and buyback of shares. Therefore, it does not make any difference to L&T whether it chooses the share buyback or the dividend payout route to return excess cash to its shareholders. Interestingly, L&T’s earlier decision was based on tax arbitrage (to opt for buyback) as it was considered to be a better way to reward shareholders.
Any announcement on higher dividend payout/dividend may lead to re-rating: In light of the changes in the Budget and SEBI’s amendments, the buyback option doesn’t seem as lucrative as envisaged earlier. However, given L&T’s focus to be a pure-play EPC company and aversion to asset business, we expect the company to either opt for higher dividend or buyback to return excess cash to shareholders. This is also important considering that the company expects to garner gross proceeds of ₹14,000 crore from the sale of its E&A business. Any announcement to increase payout by dividends or buyback may be a re-rating catalyst for the stock."
21,2019-08-23,Larsen,"Post-merger blues
Acquisitions across the world, especially in technology-based companies, are being evaluated on parameters such as synergies, cost reductions, expanding customer base in existing and new markets, incorporation and introduction of new technologies, innovation, and the like. Based on these criteria, investment bankers justify their valuation numbers.
In spite of the due diligence, often many acquisitions fail. The primary reason cited for such failures is the neglect of human resource issues and lack of post-acquisition integration activities. L&T now holds around 60 per cent stake in Mindtree. Owing to the exit of its founders and key leaders, investors obviously are concerned about the future growth of the company.
Characteristics of tech firms: Tech firms are vastly different. They differ from manufacturing or other service firms in terms of their work culture and values. For instance, Mindtree differentiated itself from other mid-tier players by using its culture as a soft differentiator.
In an interview, Mindtree’s co-founder, N Krishnakumar, said: “What we sell is a promise of building a relationship… every firm has critical skills, the customer wants to know will those skills match my need and my organisation’s. Hence, our culture and values are key differentiators”.
What is post-acquisition integration?: This means involving people from both organisations who are in core business activities such as planning, decision-making, selling, etc. Involving people from both sides sends positive signals about the management’s commitment to learn and co-create value which is greater than what either parties could have created individually.
Engaging employees is the most important element of post-acquisition integration and if it is not handled carefully, the impact could be seen in the form of key people leaving the organisation.
Instilling confidence: Mindtree employs around 20,000 people and it refers to them as ‘Mindtree Minds'. The most natural question that comes to an employee following the acquisition is: ‘What will happen to me?’ Creating confidence in the minds of the employees is crucial. And, in attempting this, communication is key.
For employees of the acquired company, there is a threat to their career and livelihood whereas the for those in the acquiring company, it is an opportunity to learn and grow. Apart from employees, clients of the $1 billion software services exporter need to be convinced. Mindtree’s clients across the globe expect assurance and a sense of continuity from the new management.
In a recent interview, L&T head Subrahmanyan said: “AM Naik, Mindtree’s non-executive chairman, has written to each and every client of Mindtree, and assured them of full cooperation and the benefits of the services. And, we have got replies from some of the clients.” This is a befitting example of a well-thought-out communication. As far as the shareholders are concerned, L&T currently does not intend to increase shareholding to 66 per cent as originally mentioned in the open offer. The new management has assured the shareholders that they are going to concentrate on growth and can reap the benefits of L&T's global connections and networks.
Thus, when it comes to post integration, the major challenge for the new management is creating confidence in the minds of three parties — employees, clients, and shareholders. It is evident that L&T recognised these aspects and, accordingly, chalked out its activities.

BL Research Bureau
The stock of infrastructure major Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has been buzzing of late, gaining nearly 5 per cent over the past two weeks. A steady flow of orders has cheered the market. Over the last two months, the company has bagged eight orders totalling about ₹ 13,500 crore across various divisions. In the past week alone, it has bagged two sizeable orders through its power and hydrocarbon businesses.
According to reports , the power division of L&T bagged a significant order from NTPC to set up Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system at Vindhyachal Super Thermal Power Station, in Madhya Pradesh. The division had bagged similar orders in July 2019 for setting up FGD systems at three power plants of Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) in West Bengal. This is thanks to the move of Environment Ministry, which mandated the setting up of FGD systems in existing and upcoming thermal power plants to curtail SO2 emissions.

This apart, the hydrocarbon engineering business too secured a large order from Saudi Aramco for the Engineering Procurement Construction and Installation (EPCI) of 28 offshore fields of the company. Earlier in July, Saudi Aramco had awarded the company with another Mega EPCI project in its Marjan field.
In its earnings call for the quarter ending June 2019, L&T’s management kept their order intake growth guidance at a modest 10-12 per cent year on year, which may translate to an order inflow of ₹ 31,570- 32,000 crore in the September quarter of FY20. Given the orders awarded to various divisions (subsidiaries & JVs) of the company in the last two months, the company has achieved at least 40 per cent of the targeted order inflow for the quarter ending September 30, 2019.
Orders inflow from various segments
Tapping on the current water crisis, the company’s water & effluent treatment business (which the company operates through a JV with Tecton Engineering and Construction LLC, UAE), has bagged an order from the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation for setting up a 100 MLD water desalination plant. It has also secured an order from a major defence PSU for the construction of a strategic project for the Indian Air Force in July.
Though the company do not specify the exact value of the contract, it the orders awarded as significant/ large/ major/ mega, according to the order value involved. Orders worth ₹ 1,000 to 2,500 crore are classified as significant, while those above ₹ 2,500 crore but less than ₹ 5,000 crore are termed as large orders. Mega orders are those involving more than ₹ 7,000 crore and the ones ranging from ₹ 5,000-7,000 crore are categorized as major orders.
Considering the lower end of order size, the eight orders awarded in July and August 2019 — totalling ₹ 13,500 crore — comes to about 42 per cent of the targeted inflow for the September 2019 quarter.
In the quarter ending June 2019, the company reported a consolidated order inflow of ₹ 38,700 crore, recording a growth of 11.2 per cent year on year, taking the consolidated order backlog of the company to ₹ 2.9 lakh crore. The huge outstanding order book mostly comprises of complicated long-duration orders, giving the company revenue visibility for the next 3 to 4 years.
The order inflows declined by 11 and 7 per cent respectively in the first two-quarters of FY18 on account of drop in orders being awarded in the infrastructure, heavy engineering and hydrocarbon businesses, largely reflecting the lull in the domestic economy.
The company thus shifted its focus towards international orders. The growth in domestic order inflows revived in the first half of FY19, though the growth numbers also appeared robust (to 32 and 46 per cent in the first two quarters) on account of a low base. The company’s consolidated order inflows grew by 13.9 per cent and 11. 2 per cent respectively in 4QFY19 and 1QFY20. International orders now constitute 22 per cent of the company’s order backlog."

14,2019-09-08,Larsen,"L&T: Well-engineered - Buy
The Centre’s push towards infrastructure — road construction, electrification of railways and high-speed rail, airport expansion and smart cities — is likely to augur well for infra major L&T’s order flow. Aside from a healthy pipeline of projects providing good revenue visibility, the company’s diversified business and strong financials are key positives. The company has also added several private players, alongside a few overseas ones, to its client base.
The Centre had announced in the Budget a spend of ₹100-lakh crore towards infrastructure over the next five years. However, owing to funding constraints, developments on the ground have fallen short of expectations. Despite the broader slowdown, L&T witnessed a healthy order intake of ₹1.8-lakh crore in FY19, 16 per cent growth year-on-year (consolidated basis), predominantly on account of diversification. In the current fiscal too, the company is off to a good start, bagging orders worth ₹38,700 crore in the latest June quarter.
At a current market price of ₹1,328, the stock trades at a PE of 20.6 times, which is at discount to its five-year average PE of 27 times. Long-term investors can buy the stock at current levels.








 
After a lull in the order book growth from its mainstream transportation segments, the company began eyeing more projects from commercial buildings, including hospitals, construction and mining equipment, realty, hydrocarbon, power and services businesses. The company also went aggressive on tapping relatively newer segments such as defence engineering and water treatment processes. Focusing on hydrocarbon and heavy engineering businesses also helped the company add to its international client base.
The company is on a strong footing in West Asia through its transportation infrastructure and hydrocarbon business. But dealings with the oil-dependent economies have become riskier and volatile in recent times. To mitigate this risk, the company added Africa, Bangladesh, Thailand and Malaysia, among other nations, to its portfolio (in terms of geographies), by focusing on several business segments.
In short, the company had reported an order backlog of ₹2.93-lakh crore in FY19, 21.6 per cent of which pertains to international orders. Infrastructure, hydrocarbon, defence engineering and power segments are the major contributors — comprising 76, 13, 4 and 2 per cent respectively of the outstanding order book. Prominent ones in the outstanding order book include engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) at international airports of Navi Mumbai and Delhi; water desalination plant in Gujarat; metro and smart cities projects at several locations; flue-gas desulfurisation (FGD) and silicon controlled rectifier(SCR) plants at thermal power stations; engineering procurement construction and installation (EPCI) of varied plant and machinery for oil fields in UAE; and power and railway and bridge EPCI contracts in Malaysia, Thailand and Bangladesh.
 










 
In the June quarter too, the company bagged orders worth ₹38,700 crore, recording a growth of 11.2 per cent Y-o-Y. Post announcing its June quarter results, the company revealed further additions to the order book with nine orders from infrastructure, hydrocarbon and power businesses, awarded in July and August. The orders awarded so far in the second quarter of FY20 are worth more than ₹13,500 crore. The existing order book comprises complex long duration contracts, providing revenue visibility for the next few years.
The company’s revenues have been growing at a CAGR of 11 per cent since FY15, while profits have grown at a CAGR of 17 per cent. In FY19, the consolidated revenues of the company grew by 18 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹1.41-lakh crore. The infrastructure business contributes a significant chunk (51 per cent) to the consolidated revenues of the company, followed by hydrocarbon, IT technology services and financial services at 11, 10, 9 per cent respectively in FY19.
The company’s operating income stood at ₹16,325 crore, 38 per cent of which came from the infrastructure business. High-margin businesses like IT and technology services, financial services, heavy engineering and defence engineering contribute a lower 21, 15, 4, 4 per cent respectively to the consolidated operating income. The overall consolidated EBITDA margin hence stood at 11.6 per cent.
Going ahead, Mindtree’s acquisition could drag the company’s earnings. However, L&T’s mainstay infrastructure business can help offset this to some extent.
The company’s management had, in its earnings call, guided for a 12-15 per cent increase in revenues and EBITDA margins (excluding the services business) to remain at the current levels of 10.5 per cent. Given the healthy order intake, the growth guidance doesn’t seem difficult to achieve.
In the quarter ending June 2019, the company continued to post strong numbers. The revenues grew by 10 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹29,600 crore. The consolidated debt-equity ratio is at 1.8 times, putting it in a far better spot than its peers GMR and Ashoka Buildcon that have debt-to-equity of more than 20 times."

9,2019-10-11,Larsen,"L&T Construction businesses bag a slew of contracts 


L&T Construction has bagged a slew of orders for its power Transmission & Distribution and Metallurgy & Material Handling businesses.
These orders have been classified as significant, which means that they are valued in the range of Rs 1,000 crore–Rs 2,500 crore. 
L&T has won an Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract in Mozambique for a 400kV overhead transmission line between the towns of Chimuara and Alto Molocue in Zambezia Province. This link is a part of the Chimuara–Nacala Transmission Project funded by the Islamic Development Bank. The completion of this project will propel the industrial growth of the central and northern provinces, especially the Mocuba and Nacala Special Economic Zones and the megaprojects in the province of Cabo Delgado province, and will eventually facilitate regional inter-connectivity with the United Republic of Tanzania, L&T said.
L&T has also bagged a project for the design, supply and construction of a 220kV substation project from one of the government utilities in the UAE. 
The company also has got orders for modernising the electrical distribution network in the Gurugram Smart City project in Haryana. The existing 11kV overhead distribution network will be converted into an underground cable network to improve the reliability of power supply.
L&T has also bagged an order for the construction of 765kV and 400kV transmission lines in the Kutch region in Gujarat, which has wind energy potential. High capacity transmission systems have been planned to integrate and evacuate the power from this region.
The Metallurgy and Material Handling Business of L&T has bagged an EPC order from NTPC Ltd for coal sizing and transportation through high-capacity, long-distance pipe conveyors from Kerandari, a coal mining project in Hazaribagh district in Jharkhand, to provide uninterrupted coal supply to the nearby power plants."

The Power business of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has operationalised two thermal power units of 660 MW each at NTPC’s Khargone Super Thermal Power project in Madhya Pradesh and Tanda Thermal Power Station in Uttar Pradesh.
The 660 MW Khargone unit is the country’s first ultra-supercritical unit set up on complete engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) basis. Ultra-supercritical units feature steam parameters of 600-degree Celsius and 270 kg/cm2 pressure resulting in higher efficiencies, enabling plants to consume less coal, resulting in lesser emissions in comparison to sub-critical and supercritical power plants.
SN Subrahmanyan, CEO & Managing Director - L&T, said: “Successful completion of full load trial run of India’s first ultra-supercritical power plant unit showcases our robust capabilities in engineering, manufacturing, project management and construction in executing complex mega power projects.”
Further, this has enabled NTPC to add 1320 MW capacity to the national grid and has also demonstrated L&T’s capabilities in executing complex power projects in India, the company said.
Earlier, L&T executed supercritical power projects for Nabha Power Ltd in Punjab, Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd and Madhya Pradesh Power Generation Company Ltd on complete EPC basis. Recently, L&T has started execution of 2x660 MW ultra-supercritical power project for SJVN Thermal Private Ltd at Buxar in Bihar."
7,2019-10-24,Larsen,"Larsen & Toubro shares rise over 2 per cent
 Larsen & Toubro shares on Thursday gained over 2 per cent after the company posted over 13 per cent rise in its consolidated profit after tax for the quarter ended September.
 Shares of the company gained 2.44 per cent to Rs 1,466 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
 On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the scrip rose 2.45 per cent to Rs 1,467.
 The company on Wednesday posted over 13 per cent rise in its consolidated profit after tax at Rs 2,527.26 crore for the quarter ended September 30.
 It had posted a consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 2,230.49 crore in the year-ago period, Larsen & Toubro said in a filing to the BSE.
“The overall PAT at Rs 2,527 crore, including the PAT from discontinued operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, grew by 13.3 per cent over the corresponding quarter of the previous (financial year),” the company said in a statement.
 The consolidated total income during the July-September quarter increased to Rs 35,924.89 crore, over Rs 31,086.59 crore in the year-ago period."
6,2019-10-24,Larsen,"L&T reports stellar Q2 numbers thanks to diversified business
 


The slowdown in economic activity impacted the performance of most companies in the infrastructure and construction space. L&T also saw a 33 per cent YoY drop in its order inflows during the quarter, in its infrastructure segment. This can predominantly be attributed to the company’s heavy dependence on public sector orders (for this segment) and the huge delays in order awarding by the Centre and several state governments.
However, thanks to the large value order wins in hydrocarbon, buildings & factories and power businesses, the overall order inflows were up by 22 per cent YoY.
This takes the outstanding order book of the company to Rs 3.03-lakh crore, which provides a healthy revenue visibility for the coming quarters as well.
The company’s diversification strategy is not just limited to various segments but also across geographies. International orders now constitute 22 per cent of the outstanding order book. Even within the infrastructure segment, the company saw 20 per cent of order inflows from overseas.
The management had, in the last quarter’s earnings call, guided for a revenue growth of 12-15 per cent and expected the EBITDA margin to remain at 10.5 per cent for FY20.
With a 13 per cent growth in consolidated revenue and 12.4 per cent EBITDA margin in the first half of FY20, the guidance seems achievable for FY20.
On segmental basis, infrastructure and hydrocarbon businesses posted healthy margins, led predominantly by good execution progress and realisation of variation claims.
However, the Information Technology and Technological Services (IT&TS) segment saw a drop in EBITDA margin by more than 5 percentage points during the quarter, when it was impacted by Mindtree’s acquisition. While the segment saw a 64 per cent growth in the topline due to the acquisition, additional costs on account of the merger and staffing costs (in Mindtree) acted as an overhang on operational profits.
This, coupled with increased credit costs in its financial services arm, led to a surge in staff costs and sales and administration costs at the group level, of 39 and 30 per cent respectively.
Despite this, the company’s EBITDA grew by 14 per cent YoY. This, combined with a savings in corporate tax rate, helped the PAT spike by 13.3 per cent YoY to Rs 2,527 crore.
The company and most of its subsidiaries, excluding its IT&TS business, have opted to pay lower tax at 25.17 per cent. This has led to a one-time reversal of existing MAT credit (of Rs 794 crore) and Deferred Tax Asset (of Rs 490 crore) in the quarter. Excluding these, the PAT could have been higher.
Also, the debt levels of the company spiked to Rs 1,32,900 crore at the end of the September quarter, up 6 per cent from March 2019. Despite the debt-to-equity continuing to remain at 1.8 times, the increase in debt could spike up the finance costs further.
Despite the lull in the domestic macro environment, the company continued to post stellar performance, riding on its strong and diversified order book. Also, with the Centre trying several measures to revive the lacklustre infrastructure space, the future seems promising for this infrastructure giant. This is given its strong track record, healthy balance sheet and sound liquidity position for further bidding.
Also, in the absence of one-time costs like those related to the merger, profitability is only expected to inch up higher, given the healthy progress in order execution.
At Rs 1,440 a piece the stock is currently trading at 22 times PE, versus its three year average PE of 25 times."
5,2019-10-25,Larsen,"Analysts laud L&T’s Q2 performance 
 The performance of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) during the quarter ended September 30, 2019 has been lauded by analysts.
According to a report by Edelweiss, the growth in core engineering procurement construction (EPC) and infrastructure orders reflect strong execution in the domestic market. The company’s improved operating margin has been underpinned by better infrastructure and hydrocarbon margins.
In a quarter where L&T Group companies (except technology businesses) moved to a new tax regime, its performance has looked up. This, according to analysts, is commendable. The deferred tax rates are 25.17 per cent and Minimum Alternate Tax of Rs 700 crore was written off.
One factor which weighed on its performance was the net working capital requirement. “This continues to be elevated at 23 per cent due to the stretched payment cycle amid a tough liquidity environment, in addition to the vendor support policy,” noted Edelweiss. Orders from ONGC and HPCL in the domestic market and Saudi Aramco from the international market were considered to be positives.
However, analysts voiced concern regarding the slower growth in order book, deferment in decision-making regarding new orders from the private sector, and policy-related issues in segments like power, heavy engineering and defence."

Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) is looking to reduce the holding in its infrastructure unit to as low as 25 per cent and is in advanced talks with investors such as Canadian pension fund OMERS Infrastructure for a stake sale. 
If the deal goes through, OMERS Infrastructure could invest as much as $150 million for a minority stake in L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd (L&T IDPL).
India’s biggest engineering and construction firm said on November 9 that Toronto-based Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will hold 48.99 per cent stake in L&T IDPL on conversion of the Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) allotted to the pension fund giant in 2014 and 2015.
CPPIB invested ₹1,000 crore in L&T IDPL in December 2014 followed by a further ₹1,000 crore in December 2015, against which it was allotted the CCPS that had to be converted into equity by September 30.
On October 18, L&T said it purchased the 2.55 per cent stake held by hedge fund Old Lane in L&T IDPL for Rs47.99 crore, making it a wholly-owned arm.
With the CCPS conversion, L&T now holds 51 per cent in IDPL which it plans to cut to 24-25 per cent, at least two people briefed on the plan said.
The conversion of CCPS allotted to CPPIB paves the way for the entry of more investors into IDPL such as OMERS Infrastructure with whom L&T has been holding talks for some time, one of the persons mentioned earlier, an investment banker, said. 
“It isn’t our practice to directly comment on market speculation and rumours,” a spokesman for OMERS Infrastructure told Business Line in an e-mailed response.
L&T’s comment is awaited.
The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System or OMERS is a pension fund that handles the retirement benefits of all local government employees in the Canadian province of Ontario.
OMERS Infrastructure invests globally in infrastructure assets on behalf of OMERS, one of Canada's largest defined benefit pension plans, with $97 billion in net assets as at December 31, 2018, it said on its website.
OMERS invests and administers pensions for almost half a million active, deferred and retired employees of nearly 1,000 municipalities, school boards, libraries, police and fire departments, and other local agencies in communities across the province of Ontario.
In February this year, OMERS Infrastructure made its first infrastructure investment in India by taking a 22.4 per cent stake for $121 million (about ₹870 crores) in L&T IDPL sponsored IndInfravit Trust (IndInfravit).
CPPIB is also an investor in IndInfravit, picking up 30 per cent of the InvIT’s units for ₹1,120 crore. 
Allianz Capital Partners (ACP), part of insurance giant Allianz, holds 25 per cent of the units of the trust.
“Our investment in IndInfravit aligns with our strategy to diversify our portfolio and generate value for OMERS plan members,” Ralph Berg, Executive Vice President and Global Head of OMERS Infrastructure, said in February while announcing the investment in IndInfravit.
“At the same time, we will participate in the expansion of the Indian economy by investing into crucial infrastructure. Today’s announcement also represents an opportunity to deepen our relationships with Allianz Capital Partners, CPPIB and L&T,” he added."
3,2019-11-17,Larsen,"L&T has allowed us to run Mindtree independently... there has been stability and continuity: Debashis Chatterjee 


Debashis Chatterjee




Debashis Chatterjee




Mindtree is perhaps the first domestic IT services company that went through a hostile takeover recently by L&T forcing the entire founder-led leadership team to quit the company, 20 years after it was set up. In an interview with BusinessLine, the company’s new MD & CEO Debashis Chatterjee shares how the transition has panned out since he took over three months ago and what the future holds for Mindtree. 
 What were the challenges that the company faced after it was taken over by L&T?
My job was to stabilise the organisation and in the process, I must admit we lost some top leaders to other companies. But if you look at the leadership minus two-level, we haven’t lost any. They have been key to the overall transition. Our parent, L&T has allowed us to run Mindtree independently without any interference and left it to me to drive growth and take it to the next level. There are areas which need to be fixed but there has been stability and continuity. Our recent quarter results show that we have not been offtrack. 
 90 days later what do you feel are the areas that need to be focused upon? Has there been any feedback from the clients so far?
 I have more or less met all the strategic clients. We want to grow that relationship further. We have formed a strategic deals team. The team is engaging with the rest of the organisation. It will help me in shaping some large deals going forward. I have most of the clients and they have said good things about Mindtree. It has strengthened my belief that the quality of delivery from Mindtree has been excellent and there is a good ongoing relationship between the two. There is not a single client who has been dissatisfied with Mindtree. I must mention here about the two awards we have won which strengthenmy belief that we are on the right path. Mindtree has been appraised at CMMI V2.0 Level5 for Capabilities in Product Development and Services. Level 5 in the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) V2.0 represents a proven commitment to high-quality software development processes and delivery standards. We are one of the first global IT organisations to have secured this accreditation. We are also the winner of the 2019 ISG Star of Excellence Award, the industry’s first and only recognition program that ranks providers on the quality of their services based on direct feedback from enterprise clients. There were about 400 companies, including tier-one IT services companies, and we won this award. This is a huge distinction for us. 
 Are you looking at making any structural changes in the company as one assumes that new management usually wants to introduce its way of carrying out the operations.
Being a billion-dollar, we must acknowledge and recognise the strengths the company already has. My priority is to accelerate growth. We have been a digital-first company. We want to be the leader in the tech space and help our clients in their digital transformation journey. We also have a future-ready talent pool to propel growth. The transformation that is happening across all segments is all digital and that is a capability that will continue to strengthen further. We hope to see some good results as our engagement with our clients get deeper. I am also building strong leadership under me. 
If one looks at some of the other companies in the same space, issues about cultural fit is assuming a lot of significance especially when an outsider takes over as a CEO or even new management as it is in the case of Mindtree. Have you come across such issues at Mindtree?
It is true that when a new management takes over, there are bound to be some issues about changes in the culture of the organisation. Here, I must tell you that whatever Mindtree has done so far, will continue and it will be strengthened further. I have done several town hall meetings with the employees and I can say with good confidence that all of them are backing us. I don't think there have been any specific transition challenges we have faced so far.
 During the last few weeks, we have seen IT services companies letting go of several employees. In the case of Mindtree, several top executives have quit. Is there a major shake-up happening?
 Some leaders have left the company and at the same time, there will be quite a few from outside who will be joining us soon. We will nurture those with good leadership talent to the next level. We have a good bank of people, especially in the leadership minus two-level who will be mentored and given the opportunity to take up bigger roles. Our attrition levels are lower than the industry's average. We have carried out multiple engagements with our employees and we believe that they have yielded positive results. 
 Going forward, will there be any synergies/partnerships between Mindtree and L&T Infotech?
It is too early to say what will happen but what I can certainly say is that Mindtree will operate as an independent entity. If there are any potential opportunities for creating synergies between the two organisations, we will definitely look at that."
2,2019-11-22,Larsen,"L&T receives self certification go-ahead by Ministry of Defence 
L&T Valves, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Larsen & Toubro, has received the ‘Green Channel Status’ from the Indian government.
A Green Channel Status is given to companies which pass the quality parameters in manufacturing, auditing of its facilities laid out by the government.

Toronto-based Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) is set to become the controlling shareholder in L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd (L&T IDPL) when India’s biggest engineering and construction firm converts the Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) allotted to the pension fund giant in 2014 and 2015 by the end of the month, at least two persons said.
CPPIB invested ₹1,000 crore in L&T IDPL in December 2014 followed by a further ₹1,000 crore in December 2015, against which it was allotted the CCPS.
“CPPIB will become the majority shareholder of L&T IDPL with a stake of 51 per cent or more upon conversion of CCPS by September 30,” a person briefed on the plan said, asking not to be named.
L&T, according to this person, is willing to dilute its holding in IDPL to less than 25 per cent also.
“There are a couple of other private equity investors/funds which are willing to check-in post-L&T dilution. IDPL needs money to bid for new projects. Upon conversion of CCPS, CPPIB will hold at least 51per cent and the new shareholders who will come in will take 24per cent or 25per cent and L&T will retain 24 or 25 per cent,” he said.
As part of the plan, L&T will also buy out the less than 2 per cent stake held by hedge fund Old Lane in IDPL to help offer a larger slice to new private equity investors/funds, the person said.
L&T currently holds 97.45 per cent stake in IDPL.
IDPL has been asked to look for office space outside, in a clear indication that the subsidiary is going to leave its fold, a second person briefed on the plan said. Currently, IDPL is functioning out of L&T’s campus in Chennai.
“Once it becomes a non-L&T company, when it is not controlled by L&T, it will have to move out; it cannot be in the campus. It’s only a matter of time,” the second person said.
L&T could not be reached immediately for comment.
Out of the ₹2,000 crore CPPIB invested in IDPL, it took out ₹1,120 crore in June 2018 to invest in L&T IDPL sponsored IndInfravit Trust (IndInfravit) in return for holding 30 per cent of the InvIT’s units.
IDPL transferred five operational toll roads to the IndInfravit Trust. “After the transfer, it doesn’t have projects now which is worth a big valuation. For the past three years, IDPL is not bidding for new projects. So, whatever is not saleable to IndInfravit Trust, those are the projects lying in its portfolio. Effectively, the valuation of that will be very small, giving CPPIB a majority stake for its Rs 880 crore investment during the conversion of CCPS” the first person explained.
Besides, as and when IDPL develop projects, it is supposed to transfer them to IndInfravit Trust once the execution is over.
“It has to do it; there is no choice because the Trust will lose projects after some time. When the concession period of highway projects ends, they will revert to NHAI/Government. So, those BOT highway projects will fall off from the IndInfravit Trust portfolio. That is why the Trust is buying projects from other developers such as Sadbhav Infrastructure Project Ltd which runs nine road projects,” the first person said.
Logically, it doesn’t make sense for L&T to continue as a majority shareholder in IDPL given its reluctance to invest more money into the unit, he said. “Besides, it doesn’t want to consolidate debt”.
At the holding company level, IDPL had a debt of about ₹357 crore on December 31, 2018. This excludes the debt held by its many subsidiaries."

Emkay Global
L&T (Buy)
CMP: ₹1,276.9
Target: ₹1,559
Over the past year, the Government (Centre and the States) has seen a worsening of fiscal stress, driving a slowdown in public infra capex. As per the September 2019 RBI study on State finances, FY20E State infra spend will fall by 4.5 per cent compared with about 16 per cent CAGR over FY16-19 (not assuming further worsening since the presentation of the State budgets).
While we have argued in the past that a distributed public capex funding model led by Centre, States, municipalities and multi-lateral agencies alike provides cushion against such expansion in the fiscal deficit, we now believe that a near-term continuation of slowdown in order inflows is inevitable as slowing economy has further added to the pain.
Our monthly infra tracker suggests that tenders are still down 41 per cent YTD FY20 as of Nov19, indicating that order activity will likely remain low for H2FY20. Thus, despite a strong order inflow momentum in H1FY20 for L&T, we foresee a potential for lowering the guidance in Q3FY20 to 8-10 per cent growth from the current 10-12 per cent growth in order inflows.
We cut FY21/22E EPS by 4 per cent to factor in near-term concerns on order inflows. Despite the infra order weakness, strong hydrocarbon order backlog will support growth until FY21, in our view."
