126,2018-01-08,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank laggard in recognising NPAs: Moody’s
Days after the third largest private sector lender reported a sharp rise in dud loans, global ratings agency Moody’s today blamed Axis Bank for being a “laggard” and non-prudent in recognising asset quality stress and termed it as a credit negative.
“We believe that the bank has been laggard in recognising its asset quality problems, a credit negative for its credit quality,” it said in a note.
At its earnings update on October 17, Axis Bank, which is rated Baa3 with a stable outlook by Moody’s, reported a 24 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase in NPAs driven largely by a Rs 8,100-crore fresh slippage in the corporate front.
Because of the lower base, it could report a 36 per cent surge in profits as compared to the year-ago period.
The bank expanded its credit costs guidance, which denotes a jump in provisions it expects, by 0.35 per cent and also said it will take at least two more quarters for things to normalise on asset quality front.
“The extent of deterioration in the bank’s asset quality over the next 12-18 months may be more than what we previously expected,” Moody’s warned Today.
It said only half of the nine accounts identified by the RBI for “divergence” find a mention in the bank’s “watchlist” of accounts that can slip into NPA.
Moreover, there is also a trend of continuing material downgrades below investment-grade in its loan book, it said.
“The bank has not been prudent in identifying the extent of its asset-quality issues,” it said.
Elaborating on the non-prudence, the rating agency said the bulk of exposure in the below-investment-grade category was to sectors such as power, iron and steel, construction and roads, which are largely legacy issues, and not caused by recent developments.
“Hence, the continued high rate of downgrades into the below-investment-grade category is a delayed recognition of existing credit issues,” it said.
It said Rs 2,300 crore of loans were migrated to below investment grade in the September quarter and 3.9 per cent of the loan book was now in the below investment grade category of borrowers.
This 3.9 per cent of the loan book is double that of the watchlist, which narrowed down to Rs 6,000 crore as of September from the Rs 22,000 crore in March 2016.
“On average over the past five quarters, around 17 per cent of the outstanding below-investment-grade loans at the beginning of the quarter became NPAs during the quarter,” it added.
The Axis Bank scrip was trading 2.37 per cent up at Rs 483.90 a piece on the BSE at 1336 hrs, as against a 0.09 per cent gains on the benchmark."
125,2018-01-08,Axis Bank,"Slippages down, but weak earnings drag ICICI Bank
Private sector banks have been playing catch-up with public sector lenders, unfortunately even in piling up bad loans. Over the past several quarters, they are doing this at a much faster pace than their public sector counterparts.
Two large lenders — ICICI Bank and Axis Bank — that account for over 70 per cent of the NPA problem at private banks are mostly to blame for the asset quality picture getting gloomier. It was only expected, then, that markets would heave a sigh of relief when ICICI Bank reported lower slippages for the September quarter, even as Axis Bank and YES Bank saw steep additions to their bad loan book.
But unlike YES Bank, which had a strong core performance to offset some of the downside in earnings on account of rising delinquencies, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank reported weak core earnings as well. Also, while both YES Bank and Axis Bank reported huge bad loan divergences (pertaining to FY17) in the September quarter, for ICICI Bank the RBI’s report is still awaited, which raises the possibility of higher slippages ahead.
The RBI’s asset quality review (AQR) exercise, which led to a sharp rise in slippages six-seven quarters back for public sector banks, has been impacting private lenders in a different avatar. The RBI’s Annual Risk Based Supervision (RBS) has led to a steep rise in slippages for most private banks. ICICI Bank had reported divergence of ₹5,100 crore pertaining to FY16, and accounted for it in FY17.
On the face of it, ICICI Bank’s slippages, which have moderated to ₹4,674 crore in the September quarter from the peak of around ₹8,200 crore in the June 2016 quarter, may appear comforting. But the still sizeable additions to bad loans, and around ₹19,000 crore of outstanding accounts in the watchlist, suggest more pain in the coming quarters.
Remember, until the December 2015 quarter, when the slippages first shot up, ICICI Bank’s quarterly delinquencies were in the ₹1,600-2,200 crore range. At over ₹4,000 crore, the latest September quarter slippages (sans divergence) still remain elevated.
For Axis Bank, the asset quality picture is no different. After reporting bad loan divergences of ₹9,478 crore pertaining to FY16, it reported another ₹5,633-crore divergences for FY17 in the latest September quarter. YES Bank has declared sharp divergences (pertaining to FY17) of ₹6,355 crore, in the September quarter.


Core performance


While asset quality woes do not appear to be bottoming out for these players, there is a wide disparity in their core performance.
YES Bank saw a strong traction in loans that led to 33.5 per cent year-on-year growth in net interest income, and the bank still managed a 25 per cent growth in net profit in the quarter, despite a near-trebling of provisions.
For Axis Bank and ICICI Bank, which have a loan book nearly three times that of YES Bank, growth has been lower. ICICI Bank’s loan growth (domestic) stood at 13 per cent y-o-y in the September quarter, while for Axis Bank it was 16 per cent. While the loan growth is still noteworthy, given the general weak credit offtake, it has not translated to core earnings due to reversal of interest income owing to rise in bad loans.
Axis Bank reported a muted 1 per cent y-o-y growth in core interest income in the September quarter. ICICI Bank’s net interest income grew 9 per cent."

Shares of Axis Bank jumped to a 52-week high of Rs 551.55 on Tuesday as the bank will hold a board meeting on Friday to consider raising funds through sale of shares or equity-linked securities.
“A meeting of the board of directors of Axis Bank will be held on Friday, 10th November 2017 at Mumbai, to inter-alia, consider raising of funds by issue of equity/equity linked securities through permissible mode at an appropriate time,” Axis Bank had said in an exchange filing on Tuesday.

The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday vacated an interim order in which it had directed the Bengaluru bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) not to pass any adverse order against a private mall-developing company on insolvency proceedings initiated by Axis Bank.
Justice AS Bopanna passed the order on an application filed by the bank for vacating the interim order passed on August 28 on a petition filed by Lotus Shopping Centres challenging the insolvency proceedings, as well as the constitutional validity of sections 4 to 77, 214, 215, 231 and 238 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016.
However, the court, in its order, observed that as per the judicial pronouncements made by other High Courts and the Supreme Court, the NCLT will have to provide reasonable opportunity of hearing to both the parties before taking a decision on the insolvency application filed by the bank as the proceeding is “adversarial in nature”.
The petitioner-company will have ample opportunity to defend itself before the NCLT, the court observed.
The court made these observations as the petitioner-company had pointed out that the NCLT, as per the IBC, was not required to hear the company’s point of view before admitting the proceedings.
On the contention of Lotus Shopping Centres, which has been classified as “corporate debtor” by the bank, that it will have no right of appeal if the NCLT decides to appoint insolvency professionals in place of company’s board of management, the court said that “any person” aggrieved from an NCLT order can appeal to the appellate tribunal. The court also pointed out that the petitioner-company’s investors too have the right to appeal."

Axis Bank on Friday said it proposes to raise equity and equity-linked capital amounting to ₹11,626 crore from a set of marquee investors, including entities affiliated with Bain Capital Private Equity and the bank’s promoter Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).
India’s third-largest private sector bank, in a statement, said it proposes to issue equity for ₹9,063 crore and warrants for ₹2,563-crore.
Entities affiliated with Bain Capital, and public sector life insurer LIC propose to invest ₹6,854 crore and ₹1,583 crore, respectively, in the instruments, respectively.
The bank proposes to issue 172,630,639 equity shares on a preferential basis at ₹525 per share (at a premium of 2.4 per cent to the SEBI floor price as of the relevant date), and 45,357,385 warrants convertible into equity shares at ₹565 per share (at a premium of 10.2 per cent), adding ₹43.6 crore to the paid-up capital of the bank.
This would mean a dilution of 8.23 per cent for the existing shareholders.
Axis Bank said the funds will bolster the capital adequacy, thereby providing the impetus for the growth of the core business of the bank and its subsidiaries.
The capital-raise is subject to shareholders’ approval at the bank’s EGM on December 8. Once approved, this would be one of the largest private equity investments in the Indian banking sector, the statement said.
Sanjiv Misra, Chairman, Axis Bank, said: “Banking in India is at an inflection point right now. The credit growth trajectory in the country is turning. Axis is well positioned to participate in this development. This significant capitalisation of Axis Bank, and the interest shown by marquee investors, positions us for even greater strength.”"

Bank stocks rose up to 6 per cent after the US-based Moody’s upgraded India’s sovereign credit rating by a notch to ‘Baa2’ with a stable outlook.
Shares of PNB surged 6 per cent, Bank of Baroda soared 5.17 per cent, YES Bank gained 4.16 per cent, SBI (3.91 per cent) and ICICI Bank (3.55 per cent) on the BSE. Axis Bank gained 2.64 per cent and HDFC Bank went up by 1.18 per cent.

“Moody’s upgrade comes as a welcome move in the wake of slew of structural reforms in the economy which are expected to enhance the potential growth in the medium term,” said Upasna Bhardwaj, Senior Economist, Kotak Mahindra Bank.


Moody’s Investors Service has upgraded India’s sovereign credit rating by a notch to ‘Baa2’ with a stable outlook citing improved growth prospects driven by economic and institutional reforms.
“The decision to upgrade the ratings is underpinned by Moody’s expectation that continued progress on economic and institutional reforms will, over time, enhance India’s high growth potential and its large and stable financing base for government debt and will likely contribute to a gradual decline in the general government debt burden over the medium term,” Moody’s said in a statement.
Sovereign rating is a barometer of the country’s investment climate. It gives investors insight into the level of risks associated with investing in a particular country and also includes political risks.
For long, India was rated by other rating agencies at Baa3, the lowest investment grade and just a notch above the junk grade, which has now been upgraded a notch higher by Moody’s."

Axis Securities, a subsidiary of Axis Bank, has become the first-ever broking arm of a bank to take membership of a commodity exchange by registering itself with NCDEX.
In September, Reserve Bank of India allowed banks wishing to undertake commodities derivatives clearing to set up a separate subsidiary for the purpose and adhere to the membership norms laid by market regulator Securities Exchange Board of India.
Banks should also set up internal risk control measures and take board approvals to decide the extent to which they can fulfil pay-in obligations arising out of trades executed by clients and set prudential norms on risk exposure, among others.
Axis Securities is also in discussion with MCX to take its membership, sources said.
The trading volume in commodity exchange is expected to increase with the wide reach of banks broking firms such as Axis Securities besides boosting investors confidence in commodity derivative trading. However, these broking arms are not allowed to trade on their own behalf (proprietary trading).
Samir Shah, Managing Director, NCDEX, said it is a significant moment for the Indian commodity bourses as for the first time a bank broking arm has become the member of the country’s largest agriculture commodity exchange NCDEX. “We expect with Axis Securities already on board and many more in line, the domestic commodity markets will deepen. It will increase the liquidity and distribution which would not only make the process of price discovery more robust, but also provide market participants a more transparent and conducive atmosphere to operate in,” he said.

116,2018-01-09,Axis Bank,"WhatsApp leak case: SEBI asks Axis Bank to conduct internal inquiry
Axis Bank has come under the SEBI scanner for leakage of price sensitive information (PSI). On Wednesday, the capital market regulator asked the bank to conduct an internal inquiry to find out how financial results for the past quarter were leaked on WhatsApp chat groups ahead of their official announcement.
SEBI has set a three-month deadline for Axis Bank to finish its inquiry on all those involved in the process of making and disseminating the financial results. Axis Bank is the first casualty among dozens of companies that SEBI is investigating for leakage of PSI via WhatsApp.
The order passed by SEBI whole-time member G Mahalingam said the message in circulation on a WhatsApp Group was with regard to financial results of Axis Bank for quarter ended June 30, 2017. “The actual results of Axis Bank were announced to the stock exchanges on July 25, 2017 at 16:23 hours. WhatsApp message which gave a very close picture of the results was in circulation on July 25, 2017 since 9:12 AM. It was observed that the figures in circulation on WhatsApp about Axis Bank were either matching in totality or were close to the actual announcements except figures for slippages,” the order said.
SEBI said this could not have been possible without leakage of information from persons who were privy to the information. Figures pertaining to gross non-performing assets (NPA), net NPA, net interest margin, write-off by the bank in the particular quarter and current account/saving account per cent were accurately predicted by the WhatsApp message. But figures with regard to “slippages” (bad loans) were different from what was circulated on WhatsApp. Yet, the WhatsApp prediction that slippages could be mainly from outside the “watch list” matched with the actual results.
SEBI also asked Axis Bank to submit information about the controls it followed for handling unpublished PSI. The order said Axis Bank has informed the regulator that “it has ensured adherence to applicable laws and has adopted adequate processes/ controls to maintain confidentiality of price sensitive information relating to the Bank.”
Axis Bank also submitted that access or communication of such information, is made/done on a need-to-know basis. “Axis Bank also provided the chronology of events relating to preparation and finalisation of its financials (for the quarter)... It was submitted that the process for generation of data started from July 1, 2017 and the financial results were formally disclosed on July 25, 2017.”"

Shares of Axis Bank today tanked nearly 2 per cent after the Securities and Exchange Board of India has ordered the lender to conduct a probe into the alleged data leak.
In its first order in the WhatsApp leak case, SEBI had last night ordered Axis Bank to strengthen its systems and conduct an internal probe to fix responsibility as the initial investigation showed that the leakage was due to “inadequacy” of processes at the bank.

Axis Bank had late last night said that it would work with SEBI on the issue of ‘leakage’ of unpublished price sensitive information and take appropriate action.
It has to complete the inquiry within three months and file a report to SEBI within seven days thereafter, the regulator said, after it found that the company’s results for the June quarter were “either identical or matched closely with the figures” in circulation on WhatsApp prior to an official announcement.

113,2018-01-22,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank: Lower slippages and provisioning aid earnings
A substantial sequential fall in slippages, lower provisioning and marginal improvement in core performance aided Axis Bank’s earnings in the December quarter.
While the positive surprise on the profitability front is welcome, sustainability of asset quality performance, meaningful recovery in the bank’s core net interest income and pace of recoveries and upgrades in NPAs in the coming quarters, will be imperative for the bank to draw investor interest.
There have been several positive developments in the bank’s asset quality in the December quarter. Notably, slippages have halved to ₹4,428 crore in the December quarter, from the previous quarter.
Also, provision-coverage ratio has seen a significant improvement from 60 per cent in the previous quarter to 66 per cent in the December quarter (68 per cent on IBC accounts).
However, sustainability of these trends will be keenly watched.
Given the sharp bad loan divergences pertaining to FY17 reported in the September quarter, steep fall in slippages in the December quarter is not altogether surprising. Also, at ₹4,428 crore, slippages are still at elevated levels, when compared to the June or even September quarters (sans divergences).
Also, while upgradation and recoveries have shot up from ₹1,048 crore in the September quarter to ₹4,008 crore in the December quarter, a major portion of this pertains to two accounts which were declared NPAs in the September quarter (of the nine reclassified as NPAs after the RBI’s annual risk-based supervision).
While the bank has indicated that the focus, going forward, will be on resolution rather than on recognition of bad loans, it needs to be seen how the pace of recoveries pans out.
In the December quarter of last year, loan-loss provisions had grown five-fold. On such a high base, a relatively lower provision in the latest December quarter has led to a 25 per cent y-o-y growth in net profit.
While the fall in bad-loan provisioning has aided earnings, a meaningful recovery in the bank’s core net interest income is still awaited.
Shift in loan portfolio to better-rated corporates and reset of loan rates (lower) pegged to MCLR (marginal cost of funds-based lending rate) have impacted the bank’s net interest margin (NIM).
Hence, despite a strong loan growth of 21 per cent y-o-y in the December quarter, the bank reported a sluggish 9 per cent growth in its net interest income.
Axis Bank recently raised its one-year MCLR by five basis points to 8.3 per cent. As liquidity in the banking system tightens, pricing power may return to banks, leading to a rise in lending rates. This can offer some cushion to margins in the coming year."

Jairam Sridharan, CFO, Axis Bank


Axis Bank reported a 25 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in third quarter net profit as robust upgradation and recovery in loan accounts alleviated provisioning pressure.
India’s third-largest private sector bank reported a net profit of ₹726 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, against ₹580 crore in the year-ago quarter.
Though the operating profit declined 17 per cent to ₹3,854 crore, the bottomline was supported by the relatively lower loan-loss provisioning of ₹2,754 crore (₹3,576 crore in the year-ago period).
Net interest income (difference between interest earned and interest expended) grew 9 per cent to ₹4,732 crore (₹4,334 crore).
Other income (comprising fee, trading profit and miscellaneous income) declined 24 per cent to ₹2,593 crore (₹3,400 crore).
The decline in other income is solely due to a sharp dip in trading income to ₹200 crore (₹1,525 crore in the year-ago period).
The other two components of other income — fee income was up 24 per cent to ₹2,246 crore and miscellaneous income jumped 110 per cent to ₹147 crore — showed a healthy growth.
Powered by robust growth in retail (29 per cent) and SME loans (27 per cent), overall advances increased 11 per cent to ₹4,20,923 crore. Corporate credit grew 12 per cent.
Loan pick-up was visible across lending segments, said Jairam Sridharan, Group Executive and Chief Financial Officer. He also attributed this to strong base effect as loan growth was muted in the year-ago period (due to demonetisation). Going ahead, he expects loan growth to moderate.
Total deposits were up 10 per cent y-o-y to ₹4,08,967 crore. The proportion of low-cost current account, savings account (CASA) deposits in total deposits improved to 49 per cent as at December-end 2017 from 48 per cent as at December-end 2016.
Fresh slippages in the reporting quarter moderated to ₹4,428 crore against ₹8,936 crore in the preceding quarter.
Upgradations and recoveries in loan accounts were substantially higher at ₹4,008 crore (₹1,048 crore in the preceding quarter). Due to this, the loan-loss provision stood lower at ₹2,754 crore (₹3,576 crore in the year-ago quarter).
During the reporting quarter, the bank recovered substantial amount in cash from an IT/ITeS account and also upgraded one account in the steel sector.
On the bad loans front, Jairam said the conversation is shifting from non-performing assets (NPA) recognition to their resolution.
As at December-end 2017, gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) came off to 5.28 per cent of customer assets from 5.90 per cent as at September-end 2017.
GNPAs in absolute terms were lower at ₹25,000 crore against ₹27,402 crore as at December-end 2016.
Axis Bank shares closed at ₹611.05 apiece, up 3.52 per cent over the previous close on the BSE."

Axis Bank on Thursday said it ‘sold down all the buyers’ credit transactions’ undertaken by its Hong Kong branch with Punjab National Bank.
Buyers’ credit is a loan extended by a bank to an importer to finance imports. Banks usually sell down loans/bonds to reduce their exposure.
India’s third-largest private sector bank notified the stock exchanges in this regard in the wake of state-run PNB disclosing that fraudulent and unauthorised transactions aggregating about $1.8 billion were detected in one of its branches in Mumbai.
PNB’s complaint for registration of first information report (FIR) against the accused persons for having committed offences of cheating and fraud, thereby causing a loss to the banks, mentions that two branch officials from the mid-corporate branch at Brady House, Mumbai, issued letters of undertaking (LoU) in favour of Allahabad Bank and Axis Bank in Hong Kong. Axis Bank said it is an active participant in the secondary market for buyers’ credit transactions and it has sold ‘all the referred transactions’.
The bank elaborated that in the normal course of business, it undertakes, through its overseas branches, transactions against LoUs issued by other banks. These amounts are then credited to the LoU-issuing bank’s Nostro accounts.
The private sector bank said it has undertaken such transactions in the past with PNB against their authenticated SWIFT LoUs. PNB appears to be trying to wriggle out of the mess by stating, in a ‘caution notice to all bank chiefs’, that ‘none of the overseas branches of India-based banks have shared with us any document/information made available to them by these Indian companies at the time of availing buyers’ credit from them’."

 Shares of Union Bank of India declined more than 3 per cent in the morning trade after the lender said it has an exposure of Rs 1,900 crore to the PNB fraud case.
The stock fell 3 per cent to touch an intra-day low of Rs 116.50, which was also its 52-week low level on the BSE. Similarly on the NSE, the stock slumped to its 52-week low level of Rs 116.50, down 3.07 per cent over its previous close.
“We wish to inform you that the bank through our foreign branches have been taking exposure with Punjab National Bank (PNB) as counterparty under various Letters of Undertakings (LoU) issued through authenticated SWIFT message,” Union Bank of India had said in a late night filing to stock exchanges.
State-owned Punjab National Bank had on February 14 said it has detected a Rs 11,400-crore scam where billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi allegedly acquired fraudulent letters of undertaking from a branch in Mumbai to secure overseas credit from other Indian lenders. 
While PNB did not name the other lenders, besides Union Bank of India, Allahabad Bank and Axis Bank are said to have offered credit based on letters of undertaking (LoUs) issued by PNB.
Shares of Allahabad Bank also fell to a 52-week low level of Rs 53.10, and Axis Bank fell 1.23 per cent to an intra-day low of Rs 537.05 on the BSE. Meanwhile, the BSE Bankex fell to a low of 28,598.89 points, down 133.47 points in the morning trade.
Besides, Kotak Bank, Federal Bank and IndusInd Bank and heavyweights like State Bank of India and ICICI Bank were also trading with losses.
A fortnight after the scam was first reported, PNB Chairman and Managing Director Sunil Mehta had yesterday said it has the capability to recover the dues from Nirav Modi and promised to take action against all wrongdoers.
As the Enforcement Directorate conducted multiple searches at establishments linked to Modi, seizing diamonds, jewellery and gold worth Rs 5,100 crore and sealing six properties, the Finance Ministry said recovery would be made and nobody would be spared. PNB has already suspended 10 officers and referred the matter to CBI for investigation."

The Reserve Bank of India, it appears, is taking a serious view of violations of various regulations issued by it in the assessment of non-performing assets (NPAs).
It has imposed a penalty of ₹3 crore on Axis Bank for non-compliance with the directions issued by it on Income Recognition and Asset Classification (IRAC) norms.
Bankers say it remains to be seen if the central bank will impose penalties on banks where there has been a divergence between the NPAs and provisions declared by the banks and those assessed during the RBI’s annual financial inspection process.
The central bank observed that the statutory inspection of Axis Bank with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2016, revealed, among other things, violations of various regulations issued by the RBI in the assessment of NPAs.
IOB
Meanwhile, the RBI has imposed a penalty of ₹2 crore on Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) for violating Know Your Customer (KYC) norms. The RBI said a fraud was detected in one of the branches of Chennai-headquartered IOB. It added that the examination of the documents, including the bank’s internal inspection report, revealed non-compliance with the directions issued by the RBI on KYC norms.
“After considering the bank’s reply, oral and written submissions made in the personal hearing.... RBI came to the conclusion that the aforesaid charges of non-compliance with the RBI directions/ guidelines were substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty,” the central bank said."

Non-compliance 
 “The RBI has imposed, on February 27, 2018, a monetary penalty of Rs 3 crore on Axis Bank Limited for non-compliance with the directions issued by RBI on Income Recognition and Asset Classification (IRAC) norms,” it said.
 Regarding the state-owned Indian Overseas Bank, the regulator said in a separate release that a “fraud was detected” in one of the branches of the bank.
 “The examination of the documents, including the bank’s internal inspection report, revealed, inter alia, non-compliance with the directions issued by RBI on Know Your Customer (KYC) norms”, RBI said, while imposing the Rs 2 crore penalty on IOB.

The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) in Mumbai is set to quiz top honchos of private lenders ICICI Bank and Axis Bank for their loan exposure to Gitanjali Group, which is controlled by fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi.
Requests to furnish information on Gitanjali Group have been sent to these banks in the names of the chief executives --ICICI Bank's Chanda Kochhar and Axis Bank's Shikha Sharma, sources close to the development said. 
The questioning is likely to happen on Tuesday afternoon and both the banks can also send their representatives to the SFIO, it is learnt.

The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has summoned ICICI Bank chief Chanda Kochhar and Axis Bank chief Shikha Sharma to seek information on the Punjab National Bank fraud involving diamantaires Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi.
SFIO is a multi-disciplinary organisation under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to investigate white-collar crimes and initiate prosecution. The agency wants to join the dots connecting the irregular issue of letters of undertaking (LoU)/foreign letter of credit (FLC) by a PNBbranch in Mumbai to the companies promoted by Modi and Choksi, and figure out how they had been honoured by Indian banks’ Hong Kong branches to extend working capital to them.
“SFIO has today sought information on the accounts of the Nirav Modi & Gitanjali groups of companies,” Axis Bank said in a statement to the stock exchanges. The bank’s exposure to these entities is about ₹200 crore, it added.
A consortium of 31 banks had extended ₹5,280 crore working capital facility to Choksi’s companies. SFIO sources indicated they may soon summon other banks that are part of the consortium.
ICICI Bank said in a statement that it has no exposure to the Nirav Modi group of companies but noted, “We are working capital lenders to the Gitanjali group of companies along with several other banks in the consortium.” Its exposure to the Gitanjali group, it said, is not the largest among the lenders in the consortium. The bank said it is co-operating with the investigating agencies.
Last week, Punjab National Bank chief Sunil Mehta was called by the Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation to seek details on the LoU/ FLC fraudulently issued by employees of the bank as part of the probe into the ₹12,600-crore scam.
According to a PTI report, senior Axis Bank officials on Tuesday appeared before the SFIO. A team from Axis Bank, led by deputy managing director V Srinivasan and executives from the trade and transactions department, went to the SFIO office after the agency called them."

102,2018-03-19,Axis Bank,"DoT says no new bank guarantee from Axis Bank to be accepted 
 Telecom department has ordered that bank guarantees from Axis Bank should not be taken as the private sector lender had failed to honour a guarantee issued previously.
 The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in a March 16 office memorandum titled ‘non-adherence to contractual obligation of bank guarantees by Axis Bank’ said no new bank guarantee from the lender should be accepted.
 “Axis Bank has failed to invoke a Bank Guarantee issued by them on behalf of Aircel Group of Companies,” DoT said. “This action by Axis Bank is a serious breach of trust and contract with Government of India.” 
 Telecom companies have to routinely furnish bank guarantees to meet their contractual commitments. A failure may result in the government encashing the bank guarantee as a tool to punish the defaulter.
 Typically, a bank guarantee is issued by a bank or any other lending institution promising to make up for a pre-stated sum of money in case of default by the entity on whose behalf it is issued.
 When contacted, an Axis Bank official spokesperson, said: The bank guarantees have been issued by us on behalf of Bharti Airtel.” 
 Listing the reason for not honouring encashment of the bank guarantee, he said, “Payment of the said guarantees, at present, will be in violation of the orders of the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)“.
 Without giving details of the injunction passed or the matter before TDSAT, the spokesperson said: “Once the order is vacated, the bank will be pleased to honour the said guarantees, as per the underlying terms. This matter has been communicated to the Department of Telecom (DoT).” 
 A source who did not wish to be named explained that said bank guarantee was not issued for Aircel but rather Bharti Airtel, in a matter involving the use of Aircel’s spectrum by Bharti Airtel.
 The source said a TDSAT order on a dispute involving Aircel and Telecom Department prevented Axis Bank from making payments on the invoked bank guarantee.
 The order has to be vacated before Axis Bank can make the payment, the source pointed out.
 Meanwhile, the directive of DoT states that the action (failure by Axis Bank to invoke the said bank guarantee issued by them) is “a serious breach of trust and contract with Government of India.” 
“In view of this, you are hereby directed not to accept any new bank guarantee from Axis Bank, including renewals,” DoT added.
 The specific instructions by Department of Telecom (DoT) have gone out to all operators including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular, Reliance Jio Infocomm, Reliance Communications and Aircel amongst others. Multiple people confirmed receiving the said order."
101,2018-03-26,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank’s rating unaffected by not honouring guarantee:Fitch 
 Axis Bank’s failure to honour a bank guarantee due to legal tangles does not amount to a default, and the third largest private sector lender’s ratings will not be affected, global ratings agency Fitch said today. “Axis Bank’s failure to honour a guarantee it issued is not a default and thus, does not affect the bank’s long-term rating,” it said in a note.
The agency has a ‘BBB-’ rating with a stable outlook on the Shikha Sharma-led bank. Fitch said the bank decided not to honour the guarantee because it believed doing so would have “contravened a court order related to a separate legal case.” The agency said its bank rating criteria does not view a bank as having failed if it has defaulted as a result of “legal restrictions” on servicing obligations while it remains solvent and liquid.
It also took note of a communication to exchanges, wherein the bank had affirmed to honour all commitments. Fitch said the issue has arisen because of a legal battle between the now-bankrupt telecom company Aircel and the Department of Telecommunication (DoT). The agency said Axis Bank has informed it that the guarantee was issued to Bharti Airtel, which had an agreement to trade spectrum held by Aircel but the bankruptcy filing led to DoT calling on the bank to cover the amount guaranteed.
“However, an earlier order from the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal prevented Axis Bank from doing so, and thus, revoking the payment under the bank guarantee was the only way the bank could avoid being in contempt of court,” the agency said. 
It added that the bank does not have any other exposure to Aircel and the bulk of its Rs 9,200-crore outstanding non-funded exposure to the telecom sector, including this, is almost entirely to well-rated borrowers. It can be noted that following Axis Bank’s failure to honour the said guarantee, DoT had ordered that bank guarantees from the lender should not be taken, calling it a serious breach of trust and contract with the government.

Axis Bank Ltd was the top percentage gainer on both indexes, climbing over 5 percent, after the country's third-biggest private-sector bank by assets said on Monday its long-time chief executive, Shikha Sharma’s tenure, will step down this year-end.
The Axis Bank board had yesterday curtailed the fourth term of Sharma to seven months following an unusual request from her that she be relieved on December 2018, 29 months ahead of the scheduled term.
Following the announcement, Axis Bank shares opened on a bullish note at Rs 523.10, then surged to a high of Rs 549.50, up 6.1 per cent from its previous closing price. On the NSE, the stock opened at Rs 523, then jumped to a high of Rs 549.70, a rise of 5.85 per cent from its last close.
The board’s decision came amidst RBI raising questions over her re-appointment for the fourth term as MD and CEO of the third largest private sector lender in the wake of mounting non-performing assets (NPAs).
Sharma, who would complete her third term on May 31, 2018, has been heading the bank since 2009. The Axis Bank board accepted her request for a shorter seven-month term (from June 1 to December 31, 2018), subject to the approval of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the bank said in a regulatory filing."

With Axis Bank MD and CEO Shikha Sharma set to step down at the end of the year, her successor will have to deal with legacy issues of non-performing loans.
The bank has not made any formal announcement, but industry sources expect it to bring in an outsider to replace Sharma.
“Management transition needs to now be managed well, failing which there could be near-term challenges to operations and growth…we believe the appointment of a credible successor will be critical for the bank’s performance hereon,” analysts at Macquarie Capital Securities India said in a report.
Sharma was appointed at Axis Bank in June 2009 by then Chairman PJ Nayak. On Monday, the bank in a filing to the bourses, announced that she has decided to cut down her fourth term and quit on December 31, 2018.
Sharma’s three three-year terms at the bank have been both eventful and tumultuous. She oversaw the acquisition of Enam Securities, and was also instrumental in giving the bank a retail focus.
But, Axis Bank, which is the country’s third-largest private lender, was just last month pulled up by the Reserve Bank of India for under-reporting non-performing assets, and imposed a ₹3 crore penalty on it for violating NPA classification norms.
Gross NPAs of the bank at the end of March 31, 2010, when Sharma joined, was just ₹1,318 crore, or 1.13 per cent. This has seen a near five time jump in the last two years. Gross NPAs jumped up to ₹21,280 crore at the end of March 2017, while its profit fell to ₹ 3,679.2 crore. In comparison, gross bad loans were much lower at ₹4,110 crore at the end of March 2015 and profits were higher at ₹7,357.8 crore.
“Her stint at Axis Bank has been for over nine years and it is normal for anyone to face both accolades and problems in such a time period,” noted Rajiv Kishore Dubey, a former banker, stating that Axis Bank has also faced problems of NPAs like other public sector banks due to lending to infrastructure and corporate projects. “How the lender handles the issue of bad loans in the next one year is crucial. The next MD and CEO should be appointed soon so that he has time to settle in before Sharma leaves,” said a sectoral expert who did not wish to be named.

Nomura says it is a an opportune time for Kotak since Axis Bank has ramped up the NPA recognition process and majority of the bad news is now known.


The time is ripe for Kotak Mahindra Bank to buy Axis Bank, says a report by brokerage firm Nomura Financial Advisory Services. 
On Wednesday, Axis Bank shares were trading down 1.59 per cent at Rs 537.30 after hitting a high of Rs 552 and a low of Rs 534.10 on the BSE in a negative market.  Kotak Bank shares were trading 0.38 per cent or Rs 4.20 higher at Rs 1,117.80 on the BSE at about 12 pm.
The brokerage’s call comes in the wake of Axis Bank CEO Shikha Sharma deciding to cut her tenure to the end of this year.  Sharma was appointed at Axis Bank in June 2009 by then Chairman PJ Nayak. On Monday, the bank in a filing to the bourses, announced that she has decided to cut down her fourth term and quit on December 31, 2018.
“With a very short time left in the CEO’s term at Axis Bank, RBI’s pressure on Axis Bank’s management and with an asset quality clean-up exercise continuing, we believe this is the best opportunity for Kotak Bank to acquire or merge with Axis Bank,” the brokerage said.
A likely deal between Kotak and Axis will make the combined entity the second largest private bank in the country in terms of loans and the largest in terms of branches. 
""Our assessment suggests that Axis Bank will have to look for an external CEO. We believe this presents a great opportunity for Kotak Mahindra Bank to buy Axis Bank, which has got one of the largest liability/retail asset franchises,"" it said in a research report.
""From Axis Bank’s perspective, we believe there will be limited push-back this time for any merger, given the loss of confidence that the regulator has expressed by not approving the renewal of the CEO’s term and a vacuum in top management,"" Nomura said.
Nomura said that it was an opportune time for Kotak since Axis Bank had ramped up on the NPA recognition process and the majority of the bad news was now known. ""Since the time of the last merger talks, Kotak Bank’s stock has outperformed Axis Bank’s by 30 per cent, making the acquisition more reasonable,"" it said.
“In case of M&A, the deal would be highly earnings per share-accretive for Kotak Bank even after paying a meaningful premium to Axis Bank shareholders,” the brokerage added.
Nomura also said Kotak Bank would gain liability and retail asset size enough to rub shoulders with HDFC Bank. Importantly from the promoter’s perspective, the acquisition should help in diluting the promoter’s stake down to the requirements stipulated by the RBI. The RBI requires promoters of private banks to bring down their holding to 15 per cent within 12 years of commencement of operations. The central bank has allowed Kotak Bank’s promoter Uday Kotak to bring down his holding in the bank to 15 per cent by March 2020. Uday Kotak and his family currently hold 30.06 per cent stake in the company.

Axis Bank Managing Director and CEO Shikha Sharma has decided to cut her fourth term at the helm and is set to step down from her post at the end of the year. The RBI is understood to have raised questions as to why Sharma was being given a fourth term.
 
In December, the bank’s Board had decided to re-appoint her for three years from June 1, 2018, for her fourth term. It had sought permission from the Reserve Bank of India to let Sharma continue for another term.
The Bank informed the bourses in a filing on Monday that “Shikha Sharma, Managing Director & CEO of the Bank, has requested the Board to reconsider the period of her re-appointment as the Managing Director & CEO of the Bank be revised from June 1, 2018 up to December 31, 2018.”
It added that the Board has accepted her request, subject to the approval of the RBI.
Shorter term
This means that Sharma’s term has been cut down significantly and the lender will have to begin looking for her successor.
Sharma took charge as the Axis Bank chief in 2009. Her tenure has seen Axis Bank go through a period of high growth, but recently, the lender has come under a cloud over the rising level of its non-performing assets. Last month, the RBI had imposed a ₹3 crore penalty on the bank for violating NPA classification norms."

Ever since asset quality woes began at Axis Bank about eight quarters back, the worry for investors has been when the bad loan issue would bottom out for the bank.
With the bank reporting a whopping ₹16,536 crore of slippages in the latest March quarter, the management appears to believe that the NPA recognition cycle is nearly complete.
The sheer size of slippages, the fact that the bank has done accelerated NPA recognition in its low-rated loan book and also taken a one-time impact on account of the RBI’s new framework for stressed assets, does indicate a substantial reduction in the bank’s stressed assets pool.
However, given the sharp bad loan divergences that the bank has reported for two consecutive fiscals (FY16 and FY17), and the uncertainty over the impact of the RBI’s norms requiring banks to report one-day default, asset quality will need monitoring in the ensuing quarters as well.
Clean-up
There are a number of factors that point to a substantial clean-up of Axis Bank’s books. For one, 90 per cent of the corporate slippages (₹13,938 crore) in the March quarter has come from the bank’s BB & below rated book. The low-rated book has now been reduced by 44 per cent to ₹8,994 crore.
Given that about 90 per cent of slippages (on an average) in the past several quarters have come from BB & below rated book, the significant shrinkage in this book is a positive.
Two, 41 per cent of the corporate slippages in the March quarter has come from the troubled power sector. The exposure of the bank to the sector has fallen substantially in the March quarter.
Axis Bank, like other lenders such as ICICI Bank and SBI, that have a higher exposure to stressed sectors, had created a watchlist (key source of future stress in the corporate loan book) in the beginning of fiscal 2017. With the accelerated recognition, the watchlist has become negligible – from ₹22,600 crore as of March 2016 – to ₹428 crore as of March 2018.
There has been a one-time impact of the RBI’s new framework for stressed assets (that essentially does away with all the old restructuring schemes), driving recognition in the bank’s restructured book. These accounts have fallen to about ₹2,000 crore from nearly ₹7,000 crore in the December quarter.
The overall stressed book is now a low 1.8 per cent of customer assets.
Needs monitoring
While a number of reasons point to the bottoming out of the NPA cycle, there are a few points to keep in mind. After reporting bad loan divergences to the tune of ₹9,478 crore pertaining to FY16, Axis Bank had reported another ₹4,867 crore of divergences pertaining to FY17, impacting its performance in the September quarter. The RBI’s annual risk-based supervision in the coming year will need watching.
Also, while the bank has taken a one-time hit on account of the RBI’s circular in its restructured book, the framework requires banks to report even one-day defaults and draw up resolution plans thereupon.
The potential impact where cases may get referred to the IBC on failure of a resolution plan still needs to be seen.
While on the core business front, healthy traction in loans and sound capital base are positives, how the asset quality picture pans out will drive valuations for the stock. After trading at 2.2-2.5 times book two years ago, the stock has been under pressure, with its valuation de-rating to 1.8-1.9 times."

 The buzz about a possible takeover of Axis Bank by Kotak Mahindra Bank grew louder on Thursday after the former reported its first ever quarterly loss in the fourth quarter of FY2017-18. 
Dragged down by a three-fold rise in its provisioning for bad loans, Axis Bank reported a net loss of ₹2,188.74 crore for the quarter to March 31, 2018, against a net profit of ₹1,225.1 crore in the same period a year ago 
 The bank’s share price was down by less than 1 per cent to close at ₹494 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. 
Bad news compounded
The poor quarter compounds the bad news at Axis Bank, which has announced that its Managing Director and CEO Shikha Sharma will step down ahead of her scheduled exit. 
According to top banking industry sources, the bad run for Axis Bank could push it towards a merger with Kotak Mahindra Bank. Nomura Financial Advisory Services said in an April 11 report, “With a very short time left in the CEO’s term at Axis Bank, RBI’s pressure on Axis Bank’s management and with an asset quality clean-up exercise continuing, we believe this is the best opportunity for Kotak Bank to acquire or merge with Axis Bank.”
Axis Bank’s net profits for the full year plunged by 92.5 per cent to ₹275.68 crore from ₹3,679.28 crore in 2016-17.
‘NPA recognition speeded up’
“The results this quarter are a reflection of the bank’s desire to accelerate NPA recognition, and get past the asset quality issues as soon as possible,” said Shikha Sharma. She expressed confidence about growth in retail as well as corporate lending.
“The recognition phase of the NPA cycle is nearly complete,” said CFO Jairam Sridharan, adding that the Bank expects new NPA formation to decline significantly in 2018-19.
Bad numbers
 For the quarter ended March 31, gross NPAs as a proportion of gross advances jumped to 6.77 per cent from 5.28 per cent in the preceding quarter and 5.04 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016-17. Net NPAs jumped to 3.4 per cent of net advances in the fourth quarter from 2.11 per cent a year ago. In absolute terms, gross bad loans increased to ₹34,248 crore in the fourth quarter from ₹21,280 crore in the same period a year ago. Net NPAs also doubled to ₹16,591 crore.
“The bank has recognised slippages of ₹16,536 crore during the fourth quarter.There was an accelerated NPA recognition in the BB and Below book, particularly the power sector,” the bank noted. Sridharan said that 65 per cent of the new NPA in the fourth quarter came from the power, infrastructure and iron and steel sectors.
Axis Bank has also earmarked ₹7,179 crore as provisions and net contingences for the fourth quarter, up from ₹2,581 crore in the same quarter of 2016-17.
One of the largest private sector lenders in the country, Axis Bank has seen its gross non-performing assets soar nearly five-fold since March 2017, along with a steady decline in net profits. 
The RBI had in March imposed a ₹3-crore penalty on the lender for violating NPA norms.
Upbeat on loan growth
Axis Bank, however, remained upbeat about its loan growth of 18 per cent in 2017-18, inlcuding a 12 per cent increase in corporate lending. It, however, said it is unlikley to pursue long-gestation project loans.
The bank will also not be paying a dividend. 
“No profits are available for distribution as dividend... Accordingly. no dividend has been recommended by the Board of Directors for the year ended March 31,2018,” it said in a regulatory filing.

At least four brokerages had cut their price target on the stock. Credit Suisse has cut the price target to Rs 530 from Rs 595. It says “normalised credit costs are unlikely to be <100 bp even in FY20”.
Morgan Stanley says aggressive cleanup could help co retrace some recent weakness. At least 25 of 48 brokerages have rated the stock “buy” or higher, 14 “hold” and nine “sell” or lower; their median price target is Rs 629.50.

The board has also authorised Axis Bank to borrow/raise funds in Indian currency/foreign currency by issue of debt instruments up to an amount of Rs 35,000 crore. 
Axis Bank had yesterday reported a loss of Rs 2,189 crore for the three months to March on an over Rs 16,000-crore addition to the bad loan pile, driven by regulatory changes in impaired assets recognition. The lender shares closed at Rs 538.90 a piece, up 8.97 per cent, on the BSE."
86,2018-05-03,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank losses will not impact ratings: S&P
Private sector lender Axis Bank’s rating will not be impacted due to the high losses it posted in its fourth quarter results, global rating agency Standard and Poor’s (S&P) said on Thursday.
“The results do not affect our BBB-/A-3 rating on Axis because we anticipated higher non-performing loans (NPLs). Moreover, we expect the Indian bank’s financial results to improve over the next two years as it resolves problem loans,” S&P said in a release.
Axis Bank had on April 26 posted a 78.6 per cent fall in profits with a net loss of ₹2,188.74 crore. With a sharp increase in its provisioning, its net profits for 2017-18 had also plunged by 92.5 per cent to a mere ₹275.68 crore.
S&P also gave a thumbs up to the bank’s strategy to enhance risk management and compliance for the new fiscal.
“A smooth transition in leadership when the CEO steps down later this year, and continuity in management, will be important for the bank over the coming year in our view,” it further said.
With the RBI’s new guidelines for recognising stressed assets, the rating agency said it expects banks to post weak financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
“We expect most stressed loans in India’s banking sector will be recognised as non-performing as of March 2018. This will lead to weak financial results over the short term, but is critical to cleaning up bank balance sheets for long-term prosperity,” said S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Michael Puli.
Moody’s Investor Service had also echoed similar thoughts, saying recognition of bad loans by banks will reduce their profitability in the short term but will be beneficial in the long term."
85,2018-05-13,Axis Bank,"A sombre performance by private banks
 
Healthy loan growth, notable reduction in the stressed assets pool, but a sharp rise in slippages owing to the RBI’s revised framework for stressed assets, just about sum up the March quarter results for leading private sector banks. 
At an aggregate level, a modest growth of 11 per cent in core net interest income (despite healthy growth in loans) and more than doubling of provisions, have led to a 30 per cent y-o-y fall in net profit in the March quarter for private sector banks. 
The sombre performance is mostly attributable to two large banks — ICICI Bank and Axis Bank — together constituting over 70 per cent of the total NPAs of all private banks. 
The banks’ relatively higher exposure to stressed sectors and the RBI’s diktat on stressed assets have weighed on their earnings.
Accelerated NPA recognition
What hung as a Damocles sword over banks in the March quarter was the RBI’s circular issued in February on the revised framework for resolving stressed accounts, which was expected to result in a steep rise in slippages and provisioning. Essentially, the RBI has done away with all the old restructuring schemes.
There has been a significant one-time impact of the RBI’s diktat on ICICI Bank and Axis Bank in the March quarter. 
Axis Bank reported ₹16,536 crore of slippages in the latest March quarter. Restructured accounts under SDR, S4A, 5:25 etc, have fallen to about ₹2,000 crore from nearly ₹7,000 crore in the December quarter. 
ICICI Bank reported slippages of ₹15,737 crore in the March quarter, of which about ₹9,900 crore has been on account of the RBI’s new framework for stressed assets. 
The sharp rise in slippages has resulted in an increase in provisioning, impacting earnings for these banks. 
While net profit for ICICI Bank fell by 49 per cent y-o-y in the March quarter, Axis Bank’s earnings slipped into the red, reporting a loss of ₹2,189 crore for the quarter. 
YES Bank, predominantly a corporate lender though, has seen minimal impact of the RBI’s February circular.
 The bank has seen no slippage during the March quarter from restructured book and no impact on the outstanding restructured book (0.16 per cent of gross advances) as of March 2018.
But just like Axis Bank, YES Bank has been under pressure owing to the sharp bad loan divergence pertaining to FY-17 reported by the bank a few quarters back. But given that some of the accounts have already been repaid in full — classified as NPAs, sold to ARC or upgraded as standard — the actual impact of the divergence has been much lower in the latest March quarter.
Nonetheless, given that banks have been reporting divergences over the last two consecutive fiscals (FY-16 and FY-17),asset quality will need monitoring in the ensuing quarters as well.
HDFC Bank, in comparison to its peers, has managed to maintain a steady asset quality. While in absolute terms, gross non-performing assets have increased by 46 per cent y-o-y in the March quarter, given a healthy growth in loans, GNPA as a per cent of loans is still a manageable 1.3 per cent (though management sees some challenges in the agri book).
Healthy loan growth
Given that the overall loan growth within the banking system stood at around 10 per cent y-o-y as of March 2018, the credit offtake for private sector banks has been healthy. 
HDFC Bank reported 18.7 per cent y-o-y growth in loans, led by retail growth of 27.4 per cent. Axis Bank reported a 18 per cent growth in loans in the March quarter, led by retail that grew by 23 per cent.
ICICI Bank’s domestic loans grew by 15 per cent, again driven by a robust growth of 21 per cent in retail loans. 
YES Bank posted a robust 54 per cent y-o-y growth in loans, both corporate and retail business, driving growth."

   -  PTI




In what could possibly be her swan song message, Shikha Sharma, MD & CEO, Axis Bank, told shareholders that deposit mobilisation in the fiscal 2019 could pose a big challenge.
Sharma’s message, which outlines the bank’s performance over the nine years she has been at the helm, comes in the backdrop of a few non-banking finance companies recently raising funds by offering investors attractive yields of up to 9.75 per cent.
“We expect branches to continue playing a crucial role in deposit mobilisation, customer acquisition and providing localised services. Hence, we will continue to make adequate investments in our branch network,” she said.
Sharma observed that private sector banks in the country will continue to gain significant part of the incremental market share. Axis Bank is India’s third largest private sector bank.
Nine years performance
“I am extremely proud of the great franchise we have built and that is reflected in the way in which customers and shareholders have reposed faith in us. Over the last nine years, we have successfully built a strong CASA (current account, savings account) franchise on back of continued investments in branch infrastructure,” said Sharma.
She underscored that the bank’s market share in deposits has grown from 2.6 per cent in 2008-09 to 3.6 per cent at the end of 2017-18, with branch network increasing from 835 branches to over 3,700 branches over this period.
“On the lending side, we have grown our lending book from nearly ₹80,000 crore to around ₹440,000 crore over these nine years, at a compounded annual growth rate of 21 per cent. At the same time, we have achieved significant diversification in balance sheet with the share of retail loans in our loan book rising from 20 per cent to 47 per cent…The retailisation of the Axis franchise has been the bedrock of the Bank’s financial performance, thus improving the quality and sustainability of its earnings,” she said.
Rise in NPAs
During her nine-year tenure, the bank’s bad loans swelled from ₹898 crore as at March-end 2009 to ₹34,249 crore as at March-end 2018. During this period, the ratio of gross NPAs to gross customer assets increased from 0.96 per cent to 6.77 per cent.
“…The Bank has taken significant steps in fiscal year 2018 to get past the asset quality issues of this cycle and the top priority for us in fiscal year 2019 will be to achieve normalisation of credit risk,” said Sharma.
Bidding adieu
As per the bank’s annual report, the current term of Sharma as Managing Director & CEO is due to end on May 31, 2018. The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on December 7, 2017, had re-appointed her as the Managing Director & CEO of the Bank for a further period of three years with effect from June 1, 2018.
However, at the meeting of the Board of Directors held on April 9, 2018, Sharma requested the board that the period of her re-appointment be revised from June 1, 2018 up to December 31, 2018. The Board considered her request and approved the same."
83,2018-06-15,Axis Bank,"Fitch lowers Axis Bank’s outlook to negative, cuts ICICI’s support ratings 
 Global ratings agency Fitch today said ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have “gaps” in their risk control mechanisms and has revised down its outlook on the latter to negative on sour assets worries.
“Both the banks exhibit gaps in risk controls. An ongoing investigation at ICICI Bank on extending a loan with a potential conflict of interest has also focused authorities’ attention on the bank’s governance,” it said in a note. The report also warns that adverse findings may create a “reputational risk”, especially if they point at broader weaknesses in management.
The agency cut its outlook on Axis Bank’s issuer default rating to negative from stable, pointing to the high proportion of NPAs and the limited capital buffers available, despite a recent infusion. It can be noted that a spike in NPAs and provisioning for the same have led the bank, which is searching for a new head after the board agreed to cut short Shikha Sharma’s tenure, to report its first ever quarterly loss in Q4 of FY18.
Commenting on ICICI Bank, the report said, “capital buffers are better even though it has experienced similar financial deterioration like Axis Bank in the previous few financial years.” 
The agency also downgraded ICICI Bank’s ‘support rating’ to ‘3’, from ‘2’, apart from revising down its support rating floor to ‘BB+’, from ‘BBB-’ But the agency has affirmed the issuer default ratings and viability ratings of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at ‘BBB-’ and ‘bbb-’, respectively.
 It can be noted that both the private sector lenders have had a tumultuous time in the past few months. While ICICI Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive Chanda Kochhar is facing allegations of conflict of interest and lack of disclosures, it has been NPAs and the ensuing management change that is dogging Axis Bank.
 Media reports initially said the RBI was unhappy to extend Sharma’s tenure by three years, after which she requested to cut the tenure, which was accepted by the board. Fitch, which has a negative outlook on domestic banks, said the new regulatory NPAs that has accelerated bad-loan recognition, will help improve the health of the banking sector over the long-term.
The report has further said the present NPA ratios make it believe that there has been a full recognition of the legacy problems and the ongoing bankruptcy resolutions can also help positively. “We expect the internal capital generation for the sector, including the two private sector banks, to stay weak in FY19,” it added.
The larger private sector lenders have robust deposit franchises but enjoy less depositor confidence than state-owned banks due to the latter’s government ownership, but this could lead to greater changes in funding costs and liquidity in “an extreme scenario”, the report warns."

 “If the lenders cannot find a solution before the deadline set by the Supreme Court (September 16 2018), then the matter has to be referred to NCLT for a resolution.
 The NCLT in turn may appoint a Resolution Professional and give time for a resolution plan,” the sources told PTI.
 Lanco Kondapalli a 368 MW gas-based plant is operational since October 2000.
 Phase-II 366 MW is operational since December 2009 and Phase-III 742 mw is operational since January 2016.
 While Phase-I is operating with limited gas supplies, Phase II and III are not producing any power due to lack of gas supplies.
 Lanco officials were not available for comment.
 Axis Bank sought in case of strategic investors, sought bids from parties who have net worth of Rs 300 crore as on March 2017 or later.
 It wanted the financial investors with Rs 1000 crore worth of Assets Under Management or Rs 500 crore committed funds available for investment in future on the plants.
 Lanco Kondapalli Power Limited was earlier a subsidiary of Lanco Infratech Limited, which is currently under insolvency proceedings.

Private sector lender Axis Bank, on Tuesday, said it has shortlisted three candidates to possibly succeed its Managing Director and CEO Shikha Sharma who retires at the end of this year.
“In terms of extant Reserve Bank of India norms and the Succession Planning Process of the bank, the board of directors of the bank, at its meeting held on July 9, has recommended the names of three candidates in order of preference for the approval of the RBI,” it said in a regulatory filing to the bourses.
The candidate approved by the RBI will succeed Sharma, whose term expires on December 31, 2018, it added.
Though the lender did not mention the names of the three candidates, sources said that Bank of Baroda MD and CEO PS Jayakumar is seen as the top contender for the post. He has previously worked with CitiBank and was the co-founder and CEO of VBHC Value Budget Housing as well as the co-founder and Non-Executive Promoter Director of Home First Finance Company. Sources said another shortlisted candidate is an external replacement, while the third candidate is likely to be from within Axis Bank.
A decision is expected by next month, giving the successor adequate time for a smooth transition.
Earlier this year, on April 20, the bank had announced that it had appointed global leadership advisory firm Egon Zehnder to recommend a successor to Sharma.
Prior to that on April 9, it had announced that Sharma had decided to cut short her fourth term and leave at the end of the year.
With the lender facing high non-performing assets, the RBI is understood to have asked why she was being given a fourth term.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Axis Bank had posted its first-ever quarterly loss at ₹2,188 crore, with a threefold increase in its provisions for bad loans.
It is expected to announce its first quarter 2018-19 results later this month.

Indian banks may be investing heavily to ramp up their digital offerings, but most of them are still behind global benchmarks when it comes to their online banking website, according to a survey by market research firm Forrester.
The report said that ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank deliver good online banking functionality and user experience, but other Indian banks are way behind. Poor or missing functionality, weak search, navigation, and error-handling capabilities mean they fail to meet customers’ expectations at times. “Forty-two per cent of Indian online banking customers use branches because some banking activities can only be performed in person. For example, disputing a fraudulent transaction still requires customers to submit paper forms at a branch.
“There is a clear need to improve online banking capabilities to offer more comprehensive, innovative, and enhanced banking features that meet customers’ evolving needs,” the research firm said in its report, The Forrester Banking Wave: Indian Online Banking Websites, Q3 2018.
“Unfortunately, our reviews found that many experiences miss the mark. Indian banks have prioritised investments in mobile banking apps, neglecting online banking and putting future business growth at risk by failing to design services that meet the changing needs of their customers,” it added.
The study is based on detailed analysis of 50 functionality and 30 user experience criteria.
Privacy and security
On security and privacy, the report said that aside from HDFC Bank, most of the banks it reviewed do a poor job of educating customers on security topics such as online fraud.
Self-service features that let customers initiate or complete requests without having to interact with a bank employee are becoming important.
“To boost trust, banks must offer the ability to dispute a transaction, especially in the face of rising electronic transaction fraud. The banks we reviewed in this report fail to fully adhere to the RBI’s guidelines on limiting customers’ liability for unauthorised electronic banking transactions.”"

Private sector lender Axis Bank has made a net profit of ₹701 crore in the quarter ended June 30, 2018, recovering from its first-ever loss in the fourth quarter of last fiscal on the back of improved asset quality.
Its net profit was, however, down 43.6 per cent in the first quarter of the fiscal, against ₹1,305.60 crore a year ago.
The country’s third-largest private sector bank by assets had reported a net loss of ₹2,188.74 crore in the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
Sounding an optimistic note, Axis Bank Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Shikha Sharma said the significant acceleration in bad loans after the Reserve Bank of India’s February 12 circular are now stabilising. “We are not seeing any new stress emerging,” she said after the results, adding that there are gradual signs of the beginning of a recovery cycle.
The bank reported an 11.73 per cent increase in total income to ₹15,702.01 crore during the April-June quarter of the current fiscal, compared to ₹14,052.30 crore in the year-ago period. Its net interest income grew by 12 per cent to ₹5,167 crore in the first quarter of the fiscal against ₹4,616 crore a year ago.
Its net interest margin was at 3.46 per cent for the quarter under review.
Other income (comprising fee, trading profit and miscellaneous income) for the first quarter fell by 2 per cent to ₹2,925 crore, against ₹ 3,000 crore during the same period last year.
“It has been a quarter of turning around from red to black,” said Jairam Sridharan, CFO, Axis Bank, adding that the pool of slippages has shrunk significantly. “We are at the last phase of asset recognition in our corporate book and expect one more quarter before recovery,” he said.
The lender’s gross non-performing assets amounted to ₹32,662.40 as on June 30, 2018, or 6.52 per cent of gross advances. While this is higher than 5.03 per cent as on June 30, 2017, it has improved from 6.77 per cent as on March 31, 2018.

Ever since the bad loan issue blew up about three years ago, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank – with relatively higher exposure to stressed sectors – have been dragging the overall performance of private sector banks. Given that these two banks constitute more than 70 per cent of the total NPAs of all private banks, the asset quality performance of these banks has understandably been under focus.
In light of this, Axis Bank reporting a sharp fall in slippages in the latest June quarter, vis-à-vis the massive additions to bad loans in the March quarter, is no doubt welcome. While this was expected as banks had taken a one-time impact on account of the RBI’s new framework for stressed assets, in the March quarter, the steep fall in provisioning alongside, has helped Axis Bank swing back into the black. A one-off realisation of interest from recoveries, has also aided earnings. Given that ICICI Bank reported a loss in the June quarter last week, owing to steep rise in provisioning despite sharp fall in slippages, Axis Bank’s performance comes as a relief.
That said, the sustainability of the improvement in asset quality and net interest income, will be key to drive earnings in the coming quarters. The slight increase in the bank’s lower-rated corporate book, further impact of the RBI’s February circular, and divergence report will also need watching.
Fall in slippages
There are trends on the asset quality front that are heartening. For one, Axis Bank had reported a whopping ₹16,536 crore of slippages in the March quarter.
The gross slippages have fallen sharply to ₹4,337 crore in the June quarter. Two, 88 per cent of the corporate slippages in the June quarter have come from the bank’s BB & below-rated book.
From a peak level of ₹27,411 crore in the June 2016 quarter, the low-rated book has now reduced to ₹10,396 crore. Given that about 90 per cent of slippages (on an average) in the past several quarters have come from BB & below-rated book, the significant shrinkage in this book is a positive.
There are, however, a few things that need monitoring.
While the overall low-rated loan book for the bank has shrunk significantly from levels seen two years back, there has been a slight increase in this book over the March quarter. From ₹8,994 crore in the March quarter, the bank’s BB & below-rated book has inched up to ₹10,396 crore. While this has been due to the downgrading of BBB-rated loan book, which the management believes has normalised, it may need some watching.
Also, after reporting bad loan divergences to the tune of ₹9,478 crore pertaining to FY16, Axis Bank had reported another ₹4,867 crore of divergences pertaining to FY17, impacting its performance in the September 2017 quarter. The RBI’s annual risk-based supervision in the coming year will need watching.
Also, on the core business front, Axis Bank’s net interest income growth has been flat to low single-digit in the past few quarters.
While this has inched up to 12 per cent in the June quarter, it has been aided by a one-time impact of interest realisation from recovery on an IBC List 1 account. Sustainability of this will be critical to drive earnings."

74,2018-08-08,Axis Bank,"Why the run up in private banks may need watching


The fundamental performance of private sector banks does not mirror the market’s exuberance.




The fundamental performance of private sector banks does not mirror the market’s exuberance.


 It is not unknown that private sector banks—with better earnings visibility and a somewhat more resilient show—have been the darlings of the market in the recent past. In the last one year, while the stock prices of PSU banks have fallen sharply, a few private sector banks have continued their strong run. With too much money chasing too few stocks, valuations of some of the private bank stocks are at historical levels.
But interestingly, the fundamental performance of private sector banks does not mirror the market’s exuberance. For one, over the past four quarters, the core net interest income of private sector banks, has been moderating. Slowing loan growth in some of the larger banks, pressure on margins and sudden shocks on the asset quality front have impacted banks’ core income from lending. Two, bad loans have been creeping up too, leading to higher provisioning, impacting earnings. Three, the rise in government bond yields have led to treasury losses, eating into their core income. All of this has led to profit shrinking on a yearly basis for two consecutive quarters for the entire pack.
Core income moderates
While private banks have managed to grow their loan book through market share gains (as their PSU counterparts consolidate balance sheet), strong retail and SME focus and healthy capital base, the growth in core interest income has slipped. From 16 per cent levels in the June quarter last year, growth in net interest income slowed to 12 per cent in the March quarter. While growth has managed to inch up to 14 per cent in the June quarter, a low base and some one-off recoveries in few banks has helped. Sustainability of the trend needs to be seen.
For HDFC Bank, despite the healthy traction in loans, the growth in the bank’s net interest income has slowed in the last two quarters. From 24 per cent YoY growth in the December 2017 quarter, net interest income grew by a slower 17.7 per cent in the March 2018 quarter and by 15.4 per cent in the latest June quarter. For IndusInd, growth has slowed from 31 per cent levels in June quarter of last year to 20 per cent in the June 2018 quarter. From a robust 30-40 per cent growth last year, net interest income growth moderated to 23 per cent in the latest June quarter for YES Bank.
A consistent moderation in growth, not priced into valuations can weigh on stock prices, if markets turn volatile.
Big daddy banks under pressure
Axis Bank and ICICI Bank—two large private sector banks—have weighed heavily on the performance of the entire pack. Core income growth for these banks has in any case been tepid—at flat to low single-digits. Axis Bank’s net interest income growth that inched up to 12 per cent in the June quarter, has been aided by a one-time impact of interest realisation from recovery on an IBC account.
On the asset quality front, after the one-time hit in the March quarter, on account of the RBI’s diktat on stressed assets, slippages still remain elevated for both Axis and ICICI Bank. For Axis Bank, addition to its stressed assets pool remains a concern. For the rest of the private bank universe too, bad loans have been on the rise over the past four quarters.
YES Bank reported sharp divergences in the September 2017 quarter. There has also been a notable rise in gross slippages in the latest June quarter. IndusInd Bank, had reported bad loan divergences pertaining to 2016-17, in the March quarter.
HDFC Bank too has been reporting additions (though modest when compared to peers) to its bad loan book. While the GNPAs for the bank, in absolute terms, has gone up by 30-40 per cent YoY over the past few quarters, a healthy growth in loans has kept delinquency ratio at bay. 
Hence, the divergence report for FY18 will be a key factor to watch for, to assess the big picture on asset quality for private sector banks.
Overall the profit growth for private sector banks fell sharply from 23 per cent in March 2017 quarter to single digits in the December 2017 quarter. In the March and latest June 2018 quarter, profit has shrunk by 37 per cent and 16 per cent respectively for the entire private bank universe. Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, South Indian Bank, Karur Vysya Bank—all recorded a steep fall in profit in the latest June quarter."

 Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has assigned Green Bond Assessment of GB1 (Excellent) to Axis Bank Ltd's debut $500-million green bond issued in June 2016. 
The senior, unsecured bond was priced at a coupon of 2.875 per cent and maturity of five years. Notably, the transaction was the first green bond issued by an Indian entity to receive Climate Bonds Initiative certification, and the first US dollar bond priced by an Asian bank certified by Climate Bonds Initiative.
""Axis Bank's offering represented a significant milestone for India's green bond market,"" Rahul Ghosh, Moody's Senior Vice President,said in a statement. 
""The bank's excellent organisation and oversight structure and track record of timely impact reporting underscore the assignment of our GB1 assessment.""
Assessment rationale
GB1 grade is supported by the bank's full allocation of proceeds to finance investments within three sectors -- renewable energy, low carbon transport and low carbon buildings -- in alignment with the Climate Bond Initiative's Climate Bond Standard version 2.0 and Green Bond Principles. As of March 31, 2018, all proceeds had been allocated to eligible activities.

Amitabh Chaudhry


 Private sector lender Axis Bank on Saturday appointed Amitabh Chaudhry as Managing Director & CEO from January 1, after incumbent Shikha Sharma steps down at the end of this year.
Chaudhry, currently the MD & CEO of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company, has been appointed as MD and CEO for a period of 3 years, with effect from January 1, 2019 up to December 31, 2021. 
 “The Board of Directors of the bank at its meeting held today has taken on record the approval granted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the appointment of Amitabh Chaudhry as the Managing Director & CEO of the Bank, for a period of 3 years, with effect from January 1, 2019 up to December 31, 2021 (both days inclusive),” Axis Bank said in a regulatory filing.
 Chaudhry will take over from Shikha Sharma after she demits office on December 31, 2018. 
The bank had selected three candidates to succeed Sharma at its board meeting held in July and had recommended their names for the approval of RBI.
 “I would like to thank the RBI and the Axis Bank Board for the privilege and honour given to me to lead this great institution. Axis Bank is amongst the leading private sector banks in the country. Together, with the support of the Board and the Axis team, I am confident of continuing the bank’s remarkable journey these past 25 years and to contribute to its future growth,” Chaudhry said.
Chaudhry, 54 years, has been associated with HDFC Life since January 2010.
He has been associated with HDFC Life since January 2010. Chaudhry started his career in the Corporate Banking with Bank of America in 1987, where he worked in diverse roles.
In July 2017, the board of Axis Bank had approved re-appointment of Sharma, to be her fourth term as MD & CEO begun from June 2018.
However in April this year, Sharma had wanted her new term to be reduced to seven months from a three-year tenure without citing reasons, which was accepted by the board of Axis Bank subsequently.
It was learnt that the RBI had asked Axis Bank’s board to reconsider the decision to re-appoint Sharma as its CEO for the fourth term amid concerns over rising bad loans on the bank’s books. She had completed her third term as the bank’s head on May 31.
“I have spent over nine years with the bank and I shall always look back at my journey with a deep sense of satisfaction and pride. I have particularly enjoyed the opportunity to work with the Axis team in leveraging the myriad opportunities in the financial sector over the last decade. I am sure that under the leadership of Amitabh the bank would soar to greater heights,” Sharma said on Chaudhry’s appointment.
Axis Bank Chairman Sanjiv Misra said, “After an extensive search, my fellow directors and I are pleased to welcome Amitabh as the Bank’s MD & CEO. Amitabh has a proven track record and is well-equipped to lead Axis Bank in pursuing its growth ambitions balanced with a strong management.” 
Meanwhile, HDFC Standard Life informed bourses that Chaudhry has tendered his resignation. Its board will meet on September 12 to consider appointment of new MD & CEO, the insurer said.
Chaudhry is a B. Tech in (Electronic & Electricals) from the Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani and is an alumnus of lndian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. 
Axis Bank reported a 46 per cent drop in net profit to Rs 701.09 crore for the April-June quarter of the current fiscal due to increase in provisioning for bad loans. The bank had registered a net profit of Rs 1,306 crore in the June quarter of 2017-18.
 The bank’s asset quality worsened as gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose to 6.52 per cent as on June 30 this year, from 5.03 per cent on June 30, 2017.
 In absolute terms, gross NPAs rose at Rs 32,662.40 crore as on June 30, 2018 compared to Rs 22,030.87 crore a year earlier."

Private sector lender Axis Bank has appointed Amitabh Chaudhry, Managing Director and CEO of HDFC Life Insurance, as its Managing Director and CEO following a long search and selection process. 
Chaudhry, 54, will succeed Shikha Sharma when she steps down at the end of the year. 
Chaudhry’s innings at Axis Bank, which will start from January 1, comes at a time when the private sector lender is still under a lot of strain and is trying to re-invent itself with a focus on retail lending and digital banking.
The lender reported a profit of ₹701 crore in the first quarter of the fiscal after reporting its first ever net loss of ₹2,188.74 crore in the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Its gross non-performing assets amounted to ₹32,662.40 as on June 30, 2018, or 6.52 per cent of gross advances.
The bank hopes that the period of asset recognition in its corporate loan book is now over and expects to start showing a recovery from later this financial year. It plans to stay cautious on lending to the infrastructure sector as part of attempts to improve its financials.
Chaudhry, who is widely credited for the successful listing of HDFC Life Insurance earlier this year, already has vast experience in the banking sector and according to sources, is already preparing for his new role at Axis Bank. 
He started his career in corporate banking with Bank of America in 1987, where he eventually became the Managing Director and Head Technology Investment Banking, Asia and was later associated with CALYON Bank.

Chaudhry will take over from Shikha Sharma after she demits office on December 31, 2018.
Nomura says the appointment marks the beginning of many transitions in the CEO role in private banks over the next 1-2 years. Chaudhry's appointment is very positive for Axis given his diverse experience and technology/innovation leadership that he aided HDFC Life to achieve, it adds.
The brokerage has maintained “buy” rating.
Citi says once Chaudhry assumes charge, probability of Axis getting into life insurance manufacturing goes up. Any changes that Chaudhry would want to implement once he assumes charge, like management changes or change in strategy, will take time to play out as Axis is a large bank, it adds.
Macquarie expects RBI's mandated top priority for Chaudhry would be to clean up the books and focus on resolving incumbent stress. This coupled with any potential change in top management, especially department heads, could see a decision-making vacuum, causing growth to take a back seat for a few quarters.

65,2018-10-27,Axis Bank,"ICICI’s core performance picks up, NPAs moderate 
 In private lenders such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, key concerns for investors have hung around asset quality – whether the NPA recognition cycle is bottoming out, or if there are still large slippages lurking around the corner. 
ICICI Bank’s performance in the latest September quarter offers some respite to investors, who have been wrestling with the bank’s lacklustre performance for three years.
A gradual pick-up in loan growth, decent growth in core net interest income, and moderation in slippages are key positives in ICICI Bank’s September quarter performance, and this should lend comfort to investors. 
That said, slippages are still above the levels seen prior to the December 2015 quarter, when bad loans started to rise sharply. Further moderation in slippages, sustainability of pick-up in loan growth, and the RBI’s divergence report on bad loans pertaining to FY18, will remain key factors to watch out for in the coming quarters. A significant re-rating in valuation will be unlikely in the near term, until there is more clarity on these trends and the bank’s earnings visibility.
ICICI Bank had reported sharp slippages of ₹15,737 crore in the March quarter. A chunk of it was due to the RBI’s new framework for stressed assets, which, in effect, did away with all the old restructuring schemes. Gross slippages in the June quarter remained elevated at about ₹4,000 crore.
 While the slippages have moderated notably to ₹3,117 crore in the September quarter, they are still above the bank’s quarterly additions to bad loans of ₹1,600-2,200 crore until the December 2015 quarter when the slippages first shot up. 
Hence, it may still be difficult to gauge whether the bank’s NPA recognition cycle has bottomed out. Importantly, the RBI’s annual risk-based assessment for FY18 is still awaited; any sharp divergence reported by the bank could be a setback.
Also, the bank’s watchlist (stressed assets pool) is still around ₹3,200 crore, which could slip into NPAs in the coming quarters.
While asset-quality trends still need watching, on the core performance front, the bank has witnessed a notable improvement. From single-digit last year, the bank’s credit growth has seen a steady rise over the past two to three quarters, thanks to strong show in the retail segment. In the latest September quarter, the bank’s credit grew by about 13 per cent y-o-y, driven by a 20 per cent growth in retail loans. 
However, the robust pace of growth in unsecured loans (though a lower share of the total retail loan portfolio) may need some watching. The bank’s unsecured loans have grown by a robust 42 per cent y-o-y in the September quarter, led by personal loans and credit cards.
Nonetheless, the bank’s 12 per cent growth in net interest income is an improvement over the 9 per cent growth in the June quarter, and 1 per cent growth in the March quarter. How well the bank is able to sustain this improvement in core performance will be critical for earnings.
That said, performance on the asset-quality front will remain the key driver for earnings and valuations for the bank in the coming quarters."

61,2018-11-02,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank: Fall in slippages offers respite to earnings
 
Axis Bank and ICICI Bank, which constitute the chunk of the total NPAs of all private banks, have been under focus over the past one to two years, given their relatively higher exposure to stressed sectors and sharp rise in NPAs.
Hence, the performance of Axis Bank in the latest September quarter, just as in the case of ICICI Bank, has lent comfort to investors on the back of a notable fall in slippages.
That said, while the decent growth in Axis Bank’s core net interest income and moderation in slippages are positive signs, there are still some aspects that need watching. The bank’s still sizeable lower-rated corporate book (from which chunk of the corporate slippages have happened in the past), RBI’s risk-based supervision report on bad loans pertaining to FY18, and moderating loan growth, remain key factors to watch out for in the coming quarters.
Also, the bank’s 83 per cent year-on-year growth in net profit in the September quarter has been on a low base, with earnings shrinking substantially two years ago. Hence, sustainability of earnings growth will be critical for investors in the coming quarters. Some trends on the asset-quality front are indeed comforting. After Axis Bank reported sharp slippages of ₹16,536 crore in the March quarter, gross slippages fell to ₹4,337 crore in the June quarter, and further to ₹2,777 crore in the latest September quarter.
The bank’s BB and below-rated book has also shrunk substantially over the last two years. From a peak level of ₹27,411 crore in the June 2016 quarter, the low-rated book has now reduced to ₹8,860 crore. Given that about 90 per cent of slippages (on an average) in the past several quarters has come from BB & below-rated book, the significant shrinkage in this book is a positive. Eighty eight per cent of the corporate slippages in the September quarter has come from the bank’s BB and below-rated book. There are, however, a few things that need monitoring. Despite the sharp fall in low-rated loan book, it is still a notable figure. Further slippages from this book will keep provisioning high for the bank.
Also, after reporting bad loan divergences to the tune of ₹9,478 crore pertaining to FY16, Axis Bank had reported another ₹5,632 crore of divergences for FY17. The RBI’s annual risk-based supervision in the coming quarters for FY18 will need watching. On the core business front, pick-up in the bank’s net interest income (NII) growth is a positive. From flat to low single-digit, growth in NII had inched up to 12 per cent in the June quarter, aided by a one-time impact of interest realisation from recovery on an IBC account.
In the September quarter, NII has grown by a higher 15 per cent (no one-off recoveries). However, sustainability of this will be critical. Also, the growth in domestic advances has slowed from the March quarter level (19 per cent) to 15 per cent in June and September quarters. Thus, the trend on loan growth front will also be keenly watched in the coming quarters."

Private sector lender Axis Bank, on Friday, posted an 82.6 per cent increase in net profit at ₹789.61 crore in the second quarter of the fiscal, with a decline in provisions and robust growth in core income.
The bank made a net profit of ₹432.38 crore in the second quarter of 2017-18. Its net interest income grew 15 per cent to ₹5,232 crore in the quarter ended September 30, 2018, compared to ₹4,540 crore a year ago.
Net interest margin for the July to September quarter this fiscal stood at 3.36 per cent. Non-interest income for the second quarter grew by a lower 3.6 per cent to ₹2,678.38 crore, against ₹2,585.54 crore during the same period a year ago.
“Growth was restricted mainly due to lower trading profits during the quarter, which declined by 64 per cent to ₹136 crore,” Axis Bank said in a statement.
Total income of the bank grew 15.4 per cent to ₹15,959.37 crore during the second quarter of 2018-19 against ₹13,820.62 crore in the same period of the preceding fiscal.
The bank’s provisions fell 6.78 per cent to ₹2,927.38 crore in the second quarter of the fiscal against ₹3,140.41 crore a year ago.
Its gross non-performing assets (NPAs), as a percentage of gross advances, were stable at 5.96 per cent in the second quarter this fiscal compared to 5.9 per cent a year ago.
“We are continuing to see steady improvement in the overall asset quality environment. All key metrics, whether it is new NPA formation, recoveries, credit costs, NPA ratios, continue to see strong improvement,” said Shikha Sharma, Managing Director and CEO, Axis Bank, adding that the lender believes that the asset-quality cycle has turned, and it should continue trending towards normalisation in the second half of this year.
Slippages declined 69 per cent on year-on-year basis to ₹2,777 crore at the end of the second quarter.
Jairam Sridharan, CFO, Axis Bank, said this was the same as in the third quarter of 2015-16, and the lender expects to contain slippages at less than 1 per cent, going forward.
The bank’s board of directors also appointed Amitabh Chaudhry as Managing Director-designate in executive position of the bank from November 19 to December 31, 2018, to ensure a “smooth transition process”.
He will take over as the full-time MD and CEO when Sharma steps down next year.
Meanwhile, the lender also announced that its Deputy MD, V Srinivasan, will retire from the bank at the end of his current tenure of three years on December 20.

First, loans went kaput and borrowers left the country after defaulting on payments or committing frauds; then, high-profile bankers were forced to leave and even the top central banker quit in the end. 2018 was indeed a ‘year of exits’ for the banking sector.
In the meantime, the sector continued to sit on a mountain of non-performing assets (NPAs) even as efforts continued in courts and tribunals and other forums for the recovery of stressed assets, which was further confounded by defaulting promoters of corporates coming back to reclaim their assets when they were put on sale by aggrieved lenders.
The eventful year began with the lid being taken off from the country’s biggest-ever banking fraud. Billionaire diamantaire Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi, in connivance with certain bank officials, allegedly cheated state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) of about ₹14,000 crore through issuance of fraudulent letters of undertaking.
A Mumbai branch of PNB had fraudulently issued LoUs for the group of companies belonging to Modi since March 2011, and there were hundreds of such LoUs.
The magnitude of the scam shook the entire banking system and PNB is still trying to overcome the fallout.
As intricacies of the Nirav Modi scam were still unfolding, a whistle-blower in March raised an issue of impropriety against Chanda Kochhar, the then managing director of the country’s largest private sector lender ICICI Bank, which, for long, had been a showcase institution where nothing could go wrong.
Kochhar, 56, who rose through the ranks to occupy the corner office of the prestigious institution, was mired in allegations of conflict of interest, lack of disclosures, and quid pro quo while extending loans to the now-bankrupt Videocon Industries.

Subsequently, another complaint was filed against her and she had to eventually say goodbye to the bank that she had joined as a management trainee in 1984.
As regulatory and internal probes continued, the bank and Kochhar denied any wrongdoing.
Another high-profile banker Shikha Sharma was denied extension by the RBI as managing director of Axis Bank, the third-largest private sector lender. The bank’s board had proposed another three-year term for her till May 2021, but she was allowed to serve only till December 31, 2018.






Shikha Sharma    -  PTI  


Shikha Sharma    -  PTI 
Another exit story continues to play out at YES Bank, where Rana Kapoor’s tenure as CEO has been curtailed by the Reserve Bank of India, and he has been allowed to occupy the position only till January 31. The lender also saw Ashok Chawla quitting as its chairman last month.
However, the biggest of the exits took place at the RBI with Governor Urjit Patel announcing his sudden resignation with immediate effect on December 10 citing “personal reasons”. The resignation, however, followed a run-in with the government over several issues, including autonomy of the central bank. The very next day, the government appointed former bureaucrat Shaktikanta Das as the new RBI chief.
In case of both Axis Bank and YES Bank, the RBI had flagged problems with their assets. Axis Bank’s NPAs jumped over five-fold in two years till March 2017, while net profit halved in the same period. It saw its gross bad loans ratio rise to 5.04 per cent by March 2017, from 0.96 per cent in March 2009, when Sharma had taken charge.
Several lenders, including YES Bank, were asked by the RBI to disclose ‘divergences’ in their bad loan reporting. The central bank judged gross NPAs at ₹8,373.8 crore at YES Bank for 2016-17, against the declared gross NPAs of ₹2,018 crore.
As a promoter, Kapoor and his family own 10.66 per cent stake in the bank, which is now actively searching for his replacement as CEO.
In the public sector banking space, the fight continued against NPAs and the situation remains far from normal.
Gross NPAs peaked in March and have shown some moderation of nearly ₹23,860 crore in the first half of the current financial year (April-September 2018) to ₹8,71,741 crore. It stood at ₹8,95,601 crore as on March 2018.
Losses at public sector banks widened further to ₹4,532 crore in the quarter ended October 2018, from ₹4,285 crore in the same quarter a year ago, indicating pressure from NPAs on their bottomlines. Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar, however, pointed out that the record recovery of ₹67,026 crore in the first half of the current financial year, was more than double the amount recovered in the first half of the last fiscal and nearly the same as the ₹67,107 crore recovered during the whole of the preceding financial year.
He asserted that a significant recovery is expected, going forward, as a number of high-value accounts are at advanced stages of the resolution process in the National Company Law Tribunal.
During the year, the government also approved the stake-sale of IDBI Bank to LIC. As part of the consolidation process, the government also announced the merger of Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank to create a global-sized lender, which will be “stronger and sustainable”. With a combined business of ₹14.8 lakh crore, it will be the country’s third-largest bank after state-run SBI and private lender ICICI Bank."

 Axis Bank Monday said its Managing Director and CEO Shikha Sharma has retired, effective December 31, 2018.
“We wish to inform you that Shikha Sharma, Managing Director and CEO of Axis Bank Limited, has retired from the services of the bank and has accordingly ceased to be the Managing Director and CEO of the bank, with effect from close of business hours on 31st December 2018,” it said in a regulatory filing.
Amitabh Chaudhry will be the new managing director and CEO of the bank with effect from January 1, 2019, it said further.
Chaudhry, the former MD and CEO of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company, was in September named the MD and CEO of Axis Bank for a period of three years, with effect from January 1, 2019. Earlier on December 8, Axis Bank had inducted Chaudhry as additional director on its board, three weeks ahead of his taking over as the new managing director and CEO of the private sector lender.
Chaudhry, 54, started his career in corporate banking with the Bank of America in 1987, where he worked in diverse roles. He is a BTech (Electronic & Electricals) from the Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani and an alumnus of the lndian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.
In July 2017, the board of Axis Bank had approved the reappointment of Sharma, who was to start her fourth term as MD and CEO from June 2018.
However, in April this year, Sharma wanted her new term to be reduced to seven months from a three-year tenure without citing any reasons, which was accepted by the board.
It was learnt that the RBI had asked Axis Bank’s board to reconsider the decision to reappoint Sharma amid concerns over rising bad loans on the bank’s books. She had completed her third term as the bank’s head on May 31."

Invoicemart, a digital invoice discounting platform for MSMEs, expects to achieve a business volume of ₹2,500 crore by the end of March this fiscal, a top official said.
The Trade Receivable Discounting System (TreDS), one of the three approved so far by the RBI for discounting MSME invoices and to provide them with timely funding, has till date processed MSME invoices worth ₹1,800 crore since its launch in July 2017, Kalyan Basu, Managing Director and CEO, A Treds Ltd, told BusinessLine.
Invoicemart, which is promoted by A Treds Ltd (a joint venture of Axis Bank and mjunction services), is sticking to its business target of achieving ₹11,000-crore throughput by March 2020. 
“With the continued focus of the government on the MSME sector, we are confident of meeting our initial estimates (₹11,000 crore indicated in January 2018),” said Basu.
Basu also said that Invoicemart expects the number of financiers on its platform to go up to 30 by March-end from 20 at present (a mix of public sector and private banks).
Some of the banks that have recently come on board are Federal Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, and Indian Bank.
It may be recalled that Invoicemart had, as of January 2018, boarded eight financiers and 250 MSME sellers had tapped the digital platform. There were only 25 buyers. As on date, the number of MSME sellers using the platform has gone up to 1,200 and the number of buyers (large corporates) on the platform is 90. 
There are now 15 central public sector entities that are registered with the Invoicemart platform.
In TreDS, buyers, sellers and financiers are brought together for discounting MSMEs invoices and to provide them with timely funding.
Buyers, sellers and financiers have to execute bilateral agreements with the TReDS platform to transact. 
One of the biggest benefits of TReDS is that MSMEs are not required to give collateral, and there will be no recourse to them in case of defaults. 
Basu said it would be right to conclude that the TReDS concept has taken off in the country. The coming days would see exponential growth for these entities, he added."

Private sector lender Axis Bank bounced back with a robust 131 per cent increase in its net profit in the third quarter this fiscal with a strong growth in advances and improvement in asset quality.
The bank’s net profit more than doubled to ₹1,681 crore in the October to December 2018 quarter, compared to ₹726.44 crore in the same period a year ago. It had posted its first-ever quarterly loss in the fourth quarter of 2017-18 at ₹2,188.74 crore, but has been on a recovery path this fiscal.
Its total income grew by 26.6 per cent to ₹18,130.42 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2018, compared to ₹14,314.63 crore in the same period a year ago.
“Net interest margin for the third quarter this fiscal was 3.47 per cent, up from 3.36 per cent in the second quarter,” the bank said in a statement on Tuesday.
Its net interest income grew 18 per cent to ₹ 5,604 crore during the third quarter of this fiscal, from ₹ 4,732 crore in the same period a year ago.
Non-interest income for the quarter under review grew 54 per cent to ₹4,001 crore, against ₹2,593 crore during the same period last fiscal.
“The bank has faced some headwinds, especially on the asset quality front, driven by corporate slippages. Financial performance, too, has moderated and corporate loans have grown below our long-term growth rates. An increase in our operational risks has not helped the cause either,” said Axis Bank MD and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry, adding the lender will focus on growth, profitability and sustainability over the next three years.
Provisions grew by 8.66 per cent to ₹3,054.51 crore in the third quarter this fiscal against ₹2,811.04 crore a year ago.
Axis Bank said it recovered ₹998 crore this quarter, largely comprising two accounts from the prudentially written-off pool, compared to ₹40 crore in the same period a year ago. Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs during the quarter were ₹1,622 crore, while write-offs were ₹2,207 crore.

For Axis Bank, which has been weighed by asset-quality concerns over the past one to two years, its performance in the latest December quarter has been a mixed bag. While the core performance has improved, uncertainty over asset quality is not completely out of the way.
After moderating in the September quarter, slippages have inched up in the December quarter once again. The bank’s still notable lower-rated corporate book (from which the chunk of corporate slippages have happened in the past) may also need some watching in the coming quarters.
The bank has received an indicative list from the RBI pertaining to bad loan divergence for FY18, which appears sanguine and will not have any significant impact on the bank. However, any deviation in the final risk-based supervision report of the RBI for FY18, will need watching.
The bank’s 131 per cent year-on-year growth in net profit in the December quarter has been on a low base, as earnings have shrunk substantially over the past two years.
After Axis Bank reported sharp slippages of ₹16,536 crore in the March quarter, gross slippages fell to ₹4,337 crore in the June quarter and further to ₹2,777 crore in the September quarter. In the latest December, however, slippages have moved up to ₹3,746 crore.
The bank’s BB and below-rated book has also shrunk substantially over the last two years. From a peak level of ₹27,411 crore in the June 2016 quarter, the low-rated book has now reduced to ₹7,645 crore. Given that about 90 per cent of slippages (on an average) in the past several quarters has come from BB and below-rated book, the significant shrinkage in this book is a positive. Ninety eight per cent of the corporate slippages in the December quarter has come from the bank’s BB and below-rated book.
But the low-rated loan book is still a notable figure. Further slippages from this book can keep provisioning high for the bank. Also, after reporting bad loan divergences to the tune of ₹9,478 crore pertaining to FY16, Axis Bank had reported another ₹4,867 crore of divergences pertaining to FY17.
While the indicative list from the RBI for FY18 suggests a much lower ₹225 crore of divergence, any deviation in the final risk-based supervision report may need monitoring.
On the core business front, the pick-up in the bank’s net interest income growth is a positive. From flat to low single-digit, growth in net interest income had inched up to 12 per cent in the June quarter, aided by a one-time impact of interest realisation from recovery on an IBC account. In the September quarter, the bank’s NII grew by a higher 15 per cent (no one-off recoveries). In the December quarter, NII has grown by a healthier 18 per cent.
However, sustainability of this trend will be critical. Also, the growth in domestic advances that slowed in the June and September quarters, has inched up to 18 per cent in the December quarter. But corporate loan growth remains muted at 4 per cent."

The floor price for the OFS of Axis Bank shares was ₹689.52 apiece. On Day 2 (the last day of the OFS), maximum bids (for buying 1.86 crore shares) in the non-retail investor category were placed at ₹696.55. This was followed by bids for 14.08 lakh shares at ₹696.20 and 10.83 lakh shares at ₹695.25.
Maximum bids (1,63,672 shares) were placed at the cut-off price (₹695) in the retail investor category.
The allocation to non-retail investors will be at a price equal to the cut-off price or higher as per the bids. Retail investors could enter a price bid or opt for bidding at the cut-off price.
The government is expected to rake in at least ₹5,300 crore as SUUTI is selling up to 3 per cent stake in Axis Bank through an OFS."

Amitabh Chaudhry, Managing Director and CEO, Axis Bank




Amitabh Chaudhry, Managing Director and CEO, Axis Bank




ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank have grown through a ‘string of pearls’ acquisition strategy in the last two decades. However, Axis Bank, which started operations around the same time (in 1994) as these two banks, has preferred to grow organically. Now the bank, under the leadership of newly-appointed MD and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry, may shed its reticence towards the inorganic way of growing business. Chaudhry, who took the helm on January 1, 2019, feels the bank can improve its ranking in the private sector banking space. The bank will not shy away from acquiring a public sector bank (PSB), provided it comes across a right match at the right price, and can get its arms around some of the asset issues in a clear way. 
In an interaction with BusinessLine, Chaudhry observed that there are some spaces, including consumer durables and two-wheeler financing, where the bank does not have a presence, and will look to fill these gaps. Mindful of the RBI recently imposing monetary penalties, including on his bank, the Axis Bank honcho said the board and management do not want to see even a rupee as fine because it indicates something has gone wrong. He underscored that the bank is serious about complying with the RBI’s rules and regulations. Excerpts:
What are your thoughts on growth via the inorganic route?
We never acquired banks, we acquired some other companies (Enam Securities and FreeCharge). Today, acquiring a banking institution could be for two reasons: one is you are going for the liability side (and liability side is something that all banks are struggling with), or for the assets. 
Paying a huge value for acquiring assets is always a question mark because the question we ask, given the size of our balance sheet today, is can we create that? Assuming you acquire a bank with an asset size of say, ₹50,000 crore, which you can create within a year, without too much of a push. Is it really worth paying a lot of money to acquire an asset pool, unless the asset pool is in a space where we don’t have a presence and that will jump-start our whole operations. Otherwise, it doesn’t make sense. 
From a priority perspective, at least from a bank’s view point, I think a liability franchise makes more sense. Now the problem with it is that the bank does not exist without an asset. So, invariably, these banks will have an asset, which, invariably, will have a problem, that’s why they are for sale. So, the liability franchise comes with a different set of problems. 
So, when you go for asset, you may get a decent asset pool, maybe no liability. So, you can go for an NBFC or something like that, but then you pay a lot of value. 
On the liability side, you get a lot of liability, which is fine, but you have a lot of employees, a lot of asset issues to solve. So, you have to again ask the question, is it worth the pain? It’s not an easy acquisition, but are we willing to look at it. Yes, we are. 
So, what is the road ahead on this front?
The FM (Finance Minister) has talked about consolidation – we need only 7-8 large banks, as there are too many banks. I think, from the government’s perspective, will they be willing to look at allowing some of us to go and get a government bank? I have no idea on that thought process. 
In some cases, the RBI and the government have done that, but it’s not going to be easy. I think, the first step the government will do is continue to merge banks (like Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank are getting merged with Bank of Baroda). Let’s see. We are hoping, but it’s not going to be an easy acquisition...If the right one comes about at the right price, and we can get our arms around some of their asset issues in a clear way, we should be willing to look at it.
Axis has been the third-largest private sector lender for a long time? What is your dream?
I did not come here and appear for the interview to remain No 3. Let me put it that way. 
My ambition was not to take this job and move into retirement...Axis Bank is a great franchise, a great platform, great set of people, great culture. We can do something with it and take it to some level. 
This means we would like to improve our ranking. Now, where we can get to depends on how well we can execute it. 
Does the platform and the talent pool have the capability to take it to a different level? Yes, but it will depend on how, as an organisation and management, we execute it. We will try our hardest, our plans have some ambition in it.
Are there any gaps in your business that you need to fill?
There are some spaces in banking where we don’t have a presence. For example, we are not catering to the mutual fund, the broking space to the extent we should, or to the PE (private equity). 
So, there is this whole segment that has very different requirements – PE, MF, brokers, FIIs (foreign institutional investors) – in terms of what their banking requirements are. 
So, we need to see how we can fill that space. There are also other segments where we don’t have a presence. For example, we are not present in consumer durable financing or two-wheeler financing. As a large bank, we are present in most of the spaces.
How concerned are you about the RBI cracking the whip on banks?
The board and management do not like to see even a rupee as fine because it indicates something wrong has happened. We should be able to demonstrate, as an institution, to ourselves and the RBI, that we are fully complying or are in the process of complying with it. 
The impression I get is that it is more about them getting the impression from our actions that we are serious about compliance.
The reason why this cracking of whip has happened is because they feel the level of seriousness has to go up a couple of notches…if we start listening and they start getting the feeling that we are serious about it and we are working on it, some of the pressure will come off. That is my view."

Makhija, 67 is also a Director on the board of Tata Tech, Tata Marcopolo Motors and ATREDS, and has been an Independent Director on the board of Axis since October 2015."
42,2019-03-16,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank: Counting on better times
Since fiscal 2016, when the RBI had undertaken the asset quality review (AQR), earnings of most public sector banks and a few private sector banks with higher exposure to corporate loans, were under pressure. Sharp bad loan divergences revealed after the RBI’s annual risk-based assessment over the past two years also exacerbated these banks’ asset quality woes.
Axis Bank had a relatively higher exposure to stressed sectors compared to peers. In line with the overall trend in the banking sector, the bank’s asset quality too deteriorated between FY16 and FY18. Over the past three quarters, however, the tide appears to be turning gradually.
Substantial reduction in the bank’s stressed book, steady improvement in core performance and strong traction in high-yielding retail loans are key positives that have led to the stock being re-rated sharply over the past nine months.
While the steep rally can limit the upside in the near term, Axis Bank’s large network, thrust on digitalisation, diversified loan book, and strong retail franchise are long-term drivers for earnings.








 
 
At the current price, Axis Bank trades at 2.5 times its one-year-forward book value. This is significantly higher than the 1.8-2 times that the bank had been trading at over the past two years. But prior to FY16, when the bank had a strong track record of earnings, the stock used to trade at 2.8-3 times its one-year-forward book value.
Hence, from the current levels, there is scope for further re-rating, if there is substantial improvement in earnings. The bank’s return on equity (ROE) was in the 17-18 per cent range between FY14 and FY16, which slipped considerably in the past two fiscals. A significant re-rating of the stock hinges on scaling up profitability and return ratios, and improving asset quality.
Long-term investors with a three-five-year horizon can consider buying the stock on declines linked to the broader market.
On the core business front, pick-up in the bank’s net interest income growth in recent quarters has been heartening. From flat to low single-digits, growth in net interest income had inched up to 12 per cent in the June quarter, aided by a one-time impact of interest realisation from recovery on an IBC account. In the September quarter, the bank’s NII has grown by a higher 15 per cent (no one-off recoveries). In the December quarter, NII has grown by a healthier 18 per cent.
While the bank’s growth in corporate loans remained muted at 4 per cent Y-o-Y (as of December 2018), retail loans grew at a healthy 20 per cent, driving the overall loan growth. The growth in retail loans has been driven by segments such as personal loan, credit cards etc, with their share in the overall retail loan mix inching up over the past two years.








 
The higher share of these high-yielding loans will aid margins (net interest margin - NIM), compensating to some extent for the pressure on yields (on loans) on account of the bank’s decision to focus on higher rated corporates.
The bank’s NIMs (domestic) have remained steady in recent quarters, at 3.6 per cent. An overall weak deposit growth within the banking sector and intensifying race to garner low-cost savings deposits could, however, exert some pressure on NIMs.
The move to peg lending rates on retail loans to external benchmarks (as per the RBI’s mandate), as and when it happens, could also impact earnings, though the extent of pain is unclear as of now.
For Axis Bank, the uncertainty over asset quality is not completely out of the way.
It reported sharp slippages of ₹16,536 crore in the March quarter, while gross slippages fell to ₹4,337 crore in the June quarter and further to ₹2,777 crore in the September quarter. In the latest December period, however, slippages inched up to ₹3,746 crore, which may need to be monitored in the coming quarters.
The bank’s BB and below-rated book has shrunk substantially over the last two years. From a peak of ₹27,411 crore in the June 2016 quarter, the low-rated book is now reduced to ₹7,645 crore. Given that about 90 per cent of slippages (on an average) in the past several quarters have come from BB and below-rated book, the significant shrinkage is a positive. About 98 per cent of the corporate slippages in the December quarter came from the bank’s BB and below-rated book. After reporting bad loan divergences to the tune of ₹9,478 crore pertaining to FY16, Axis Bank had reported another ₹5,600-odd crore of divergences as of FY17. While the indicative list from the RBI for FY18 suggests a much lower ₹225 crore of divergence, any deviation in the final annual risk-based supervision report may need monitoring.
For Axis Bank, aside from steady improvement in core performance, significant easing of asset quality pressure is imperative to drive earnings over the medium term. The bank’s healthy capital ratios, however, lends comfort as they provide cushion to the incremental stress. As of December 2018, the bank’s Tier I capital ratio stood at 13 per cent."

At its Analyst Day 2019, Axis Bank reiterated its three-year strategy of growth, profitability and sustainability (GPS) and elaborated on its aspirations to achieve 18 per cent RoE sustainably. 
Key takeaway from various business/segment presentations (detailed later) was a renewed focus on risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC), cross-sell to existing customer base and greater penetration of the same while ensuring healthy profitability. Management indicated an unwavering focus on risk (credit, operational and reputation) and compliance as new leadership tries to build back the bank’s earlier formidable perception. 
We like the management’s strategy of achieving profitable scale across business verticals, playing on the bank’s past strengths while also its priority to stay agile in the ever-changing banking landscape. Management alluded that capital levels were sufficient for the next 12 months and the bank would need to raise capital thereafter. With regards to acquisition of stake in insurance business, a smaller stake looks more likely subject to regulators’ blessings, in our view. While execution remains to be seen, the plan is quite credible and goals achievable, in our view. 
The stock has rallied 24 per cent since our upgrade in October 2018 (outperformance of 15 per cent versus Nifty). We maintain our ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a revised target price of ₹865 (core banking business valued at 2.5x FY21E adjusted P/BV)."

Private sector lender Axis Bank seems to be back on track with a net profit of ₹1,505.6 crore in the fourth quarter of 2018-19, against a net loss of ₹2,188.74 crore in the same period a year ago.
On sequential basis, its net profit fell by 10.4 per cent compared to a net profit of ₹1,680.85 crore in the third quarter of 2017-18. This is largely attributable to lower other income of ₹3,526.28 crore in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, against ₹4,000.69 crore in the previous quarter.
Axis Bank’s net profit for 2018-19 shot up to ₹4,676.61 crore compared to ₹275.68 crore in 2017-18. However, other parameters of the bank seem to have shown a steady improvement."
35,2019-04-25,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank: Asset quality pressure eases, core performance improves 
After the massive clean-up of books last year that led to a substantial loss, Axis Bank’s March quarter results, as expected, are optically pleasing. Added to this, a substantial reduction in the bank’s stressed book and steady improvement in core performance is likely to offer a much-needed respite to investors.
After reporting a loss of Rs 2,189 crore in the March quarter last year, the bank has registered a profit of Rs 1,505 crore in the March quarter of FY19. Importantly, after reporting steep bad loan divergences in the previous two fiscals, Axis Bank has not reported any divergence pertaining to the FY18 fiscal, which is comforting.
The bank had tweaked some of its provisioning norms. Rather than making contingent provisioning towards possible slippages from low rated corporate loans, the bank has adopted a more stringent policy towards provisioning of standard corporate loans. The bank also made additional provisioning of Rs 535 crore towards land held as a non-banking asset; the balance Rs 1,605 crore of provisioning in this respect will be charged to the P&L over the coming three quarters.
Coming off from huge slippages
Axis Bank had reported a steep Rs 16,536 crore in slippages in the March quarter last year, owing to accelerated NPA recognition in its low-rated loan book and one-time impact on account of the RBI’s February 2018 circular on stressed assets. While this had led to huge losses, the substantial reduction in the bank’s stressed assets pool, had led many to believe that the bad loan issue had bottomed out for the bank. Four quarters hence, the steady improvement in asset quality has certainly played out in favour of hopeful investors.
The bank’s gross slippages fell to Rs 4,337 crore in the June quarter and further to Rs 3,012 crore in the latest March quarter. The bank’s BB and below rated book has also shrunk substantially over the last two years, from a peak level of Rs 27,411 crore in the June 2016 quarter to Rs 7,467 crore in the March 2019 quarter. Given that about 87 per cent of slippages (on an average) in FY19 has come from BB & below rated book, the significant shrinkage in this book is a positive.
Uncertainty over bad loan divergences and impact of RBI’s Feb circular requiring banks to report one day default, were key overhangs for the bank. On the former, there has been a respite after two fiscals of sharp divergences. Banks are required to make disclosures where the additional provisioning for NPAs as assessed by the RBI exceeds 10 per cent of reported profit before provisioning or additional gross NPA identified by the RBI exceeds 15 per cent of the published figure. The bank has stated that it has not had to make any disclosure on divergence on this count.
On the Feb circular, while the bank awaits the revised framework by the RBI, the management stated that it will continue to be conservative and does not expect any substantial write-back owing to changes in RBI’s norms.
Core performance
On the core business front, pick-up in the bank’s net interest income growth in recent quarters has been heartening. From flat to low single-digit, growth in net interest income had inched up to 12 per cent in the June quarter. In the latest March quarter, the bank’s net interest income grew by 21 per cent. While the bank’s growth in corporate loans remained muted at 5 per cent YoY (as of March 2019), retail loans grew at a healthy 19 per cent, driving overall loan growth.
The growth in retail loans has been driven by segments such as personal loan, credit cards, etc., with their share in the overall retail loan mix inching up over the past two years. The higher share of these high-yielding loans have aided the net interest margin, compensating to some extent the pressure on yields (on loans) on account of the bank’s decision to focus on higher rated corporates."

Fitch has also affirmed ICICI Bank’s Support Rating at 3 and Support Rating Floor at ‘BB+’, it said in a statement late on Monday evening.
“The one notch downgrade ….belief that several of ICICI’s key financial indicators are generally weaker than those of banks rated higher by Fitch as well as many similarly Fitch-rated banks operating in environments broadly comparable with that facing Indian banks,” it said.

 Top private sector lenders have cut their interest rates on deposits by up to 0.25 per cent over the last week, officials said Monday.
Generally, an interest rate cut in deposits is seen as a precursor to a lending rate cut. The moves by lenders including ICICI Bank and Axis Bank come amid easing liquidity conditions and also within days of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank earlier this month.
The RBI is betting on rate cuts, and a subsequent pass-on of the same by the banks to borrowers, as one of the ways to prop-up the sagging economic growth.
ICICI Bank is understood to have cut its fixed deposit rates by 0.10-0.25 per cent starting from Monday, officials said.
Under the revised rates for domestic deposits under Rs 2 crore, ICICI Bank will be paying 6.75 per cent for a deposit of 290 days to under a year, and 7.30 per cent for a deposit of over two years to under three years, according to the rates on the bank’s website.

Axis Bank’s (AB) annual report analysis reveals the bank’s focus on improving its earnings metrics and asset quality. As part of its FY20-22 strategy, AB targets an RoE of 18 per cent by FY22, with credit cost, opex and business mix identified as the key drivers for the achievement of this goal.
 Digital initiatives at the bank are gaining traction, with 43 per cent of its personal loans sourced digitally versus 22 per cent in FY18. Also, the bank’s market share in credit cards expanded to 12.4 per cent from 5 per cent in FY13, helping it become the fourth largest credit card issuer in the country.
The concentration in top 20 advances/ exposures improved by 171 bps/ 86 bp y-o-y to 8.6 per cent/ 12.4 per cent in FY19. However, on the liability side, the concentration of top-20 depositors increased by 39 bps y-o-y to 11.8 per cent. The bank has shifted its deposit strategy away from CASA to ‘CASA + retail term deposits’.
 Though the bank has strong management team and a well-articulated strategy in place the execution is going to be critical to deliver long-term sustainable growth and earnings. NPL cycle has shown improvement signs and we estimate earnings to recover though credit cost trajectory can still remain uneven given sluggish macro."

 Axis Bank is considering raising at least $1.3 billion through a share sale to institutional investors, according to the sources, as the private lender seeks to bolster capital ratios and expand lending capacity.
India’s third-largest private sector lender is talking to potential advisers about the fundraising, according to the people. The bank plans to seek board approval for the sale as early as next month, sources said.
The deal would help the Mumbai-based lender enhance risk buffers and support loan growth at a time when shadow banks in the country are battling a liquidity crunch due to rising wariness in the nations credit market. In March, the bank’s overall capital adequacy ratio was lower than its top private-sector peers.
No final decisions have been made, and the potential deal could still be delayed or fall apart, the people said. A spokeswoman for Axis Bank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shares of the lender erased earlier gains of as much as 2.3 per cent to fall 0.9 per cent to ₹781.6 in BSE index Sensex. The bank is still the best-performing stock on the 10-member Bankex index in 2019 with gains of 28 per cent, compared with a 10 per cent advance in the benchmark index."

Acting against a fraud perpetrated by an Axis Bank employee in collusion with an employee of a private educational institute, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached 17 immovable properties, investments in mutual funds, balances in bank accounts totalling to ₹4.58 crore.
A press release by ED stated that it had registered a case under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) on the basis of a first information report (FIR) filed by Uttar Pradesh police against Kamal Ahsan, the then bank official of Axis Bank, Civil Lines Branch in Allahabad; and Rajesh Kumar, the then designated Relationship Manager of Sam Higginbottom Institute of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences (SHIATS).
The institute later become University by the name SHUATS. It is run by Sam Higginbottom Educational and Charitable Society and its main source of funds are from the fees of students, grants from the Society, the Department of Agriculture, the UP government and the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR).
“Investigation revealed that SHUATS was maintaining three accounts with Axis Bank. Ahsan, fraudulently debited Axis Bank accounts of SHUATS by using only cheque numbers without any physical instruments. These cheque numbers were illegally provided by accused Rajesh Kumar, the then accountant of SHUATS. In this manner, the accused had siphoned off funds,” the press release said.
ED probe revealed that Ahsan routed the proceeds of crime through various bank accounts and bank accounts of family members, friends and relatives. He had utilised the loot to lead a luxurious lifestyle highly disproportionate to his known source of income."

Private sector lender Axis Bank has decided to turn cautious while lending, with newer risks emerging in the economy.
“We are cautious given whatever is happening in the economy as some new signs of stress are emerging in the system,” said Amitabh Chaudhry, Managing Director and CEO, Axis Bank, on Thursday, noting that most banks had thought the troubles in the sector were over after recognising the stressed and non-performing assets.
Commenting on the areas of risk, he told reporters that some borrowers are defaulting or there are reports of stress being felt by lenders. He specifically cited real estate and non-banking financial companies as areas of concern, but added that not all such firms are in bad shape.
“We want to be conservative; we want to get our risk management practices right. Anyway, we want to be more conservative than before and there are signs of emerging stress,” he said. “We want to be sure about... It is a good time to be cautious but doesn’t mean we will not grow or lend,” he said.
Chaudhry said he does not see issues faced by NBFCs as “systemic risk”. He said it could take time to resolve.
It is evident that a few companies need equity infusion at the earliest, he said, exhorting them to go in for fund-raising immediately and pointed out that it is unfair to expect a bailout by the RBI or the government.
When asked about the bank’s proposed capital-raising plan, he said that the Board meeting for raising funds is just an “enabling provision”.
“We are just taking an enabling resolution to raise capital at the right time..... It can be used for improving the capital ratio, acquisition or growth. Until we raise it what is the point talking about it,” he told reporters.
The board of directors will be meeting on July 20 to explore raising of funds through issue of equity shares, depository receipts or other instruments.

Private sector lender Axis Bank's net profit nearly doubled in the first quarter of the fiscal, led by strong growth in income, although it became more conservative on provisioning.
The bank’s net profit jumped 95 per cent to ₹1,370.08 crore in the quarter ended June 30, 2019, compared to ₹701.09 crore in the same period a year ago.
Total income rose sharply by 21.8 per cent to ₹19,123.71 crore for the April to June 2019 quarter, compared to ₹15,702.01 crore a year ago.
Net interest income grew 13 per cent to ₹5,844 crore for the first quarter of the fiscal, against ₹5,167 crore in the same period last fiscal.
Net interest margin stood at 3.4 per cent for the quarter under review. Other income rose by 32 per cent to ₹3,869 crore in the first quarter of the fiscal, compared to ₹2,925 crore a year ago. The bank’s provisions, however, jumped to ₹3,814.58 crore for the first quarter of the fiscal, from ₹3,337.70 crore a year ago.
Amitabh Chaudhry, Managing Director and CEO, Axis Bank, said that during the quarter the bank made a change in internal guidelines to continue increasing conservatism in its provisioning.
As on June 30, 2019, gross non-performing assets of the bank stood at ₹29,405 crore, or 5.25 per cent of gross assets, against 6.52 per cent a year ago. Net NPAs were at ₹11,037 crore or 2.04 per cent of net assets, compared to 3.09 per cent a year ago.
Loan book
The bank said it continues to grow its loan book “cautiously and steadily”. Its advances grew 13 per cent annually to ₹4,97,276 crore as on June 30, 2019. The Axis Bank scrip fell 1.82 per cent and closed at ₹706.55 apiece on the BSE on Tuesday."
17,2019-07-31,Axis Bank,"Higher provisioning weighs on earnings of Axis Bank
On the face of it, the near doubling of net profit, stable bad loans, and healthy growth in domestic loans for Axis Bank in the latest June quarter offers comfort to investors. After the deterioration in the bank’s asset quality between FY16 and FY18, the gradual improvement over the past four to five quarters has been heartening. But the strong growth in net profit in the June quarter has come on a low base. Also, a substantial increase in provisions (sequential and year-on-year), write-offs and slippages, and addition to the bank’s stressed book (BB & below rated book) in the June quarter are aspects that may need monitoring in the coming quarters. 
Axis Bank has been making additional provisions over and above the regular NPA provisioning in the past few quarters. In the June quarter, the bank made additional provisions of ₹994 crore; ₹459 crore pertains to non-fund-based outstanding in NPA/ stressed accounts. Cumulatively, Axis Bank now holds ₹2,358 crore of provisions for various contingencies.
As a result, total provisions have gone up from₹2,711 crore in the March quarter to ₹3,815 crore in the June quarter, weighing on the strong operating performance.
On the core business front, Axis Bank has been witnessing a pick-up in the core net interest income in recent quarters. After the 21 per cent growth in NII in the March quarter, the 13 per cent growth in the latest June quarter may seem muted. However, in the same quarter last year, there was a one-time impact of interest realisation from recovery on an IBC account. Excluding this, the bank’s growth in NII stood at 19 per cent in the latest June quarter, which is healthy.
As such, growth in the bank’s loans has been healthy. Domestic loans grew by 19 per cent in the June quarter, led by 22 per cent growth in retail loans. Corporate loan book grew by 3 per cent (domestic corporate loans up 16 per cent). Growth in SME was modest at 8 per cent.
The growth in retail loans has been driven by segments such as personal loan and credit cards, with their share in the overall retail loan mix inching up over the past two years. The higher share of these high-yielding loans have aided net interest margin.
While the gross NPA figure in absolute terms has been stable at ₹29,405 crore in the June quarter , the bank has reported higher slippages. The bank’s gross slippages that had fallen to ₹3,012 crore in the March quarter inched up to ₹4,798 crore in the latest June quarter. Substantial write-offs of ₹3,005 crore (rather than recovery) have led to the marginal decline in bad loans. While the management has attributed the higher slippages and write-offs to seasonality, trend in the coming quarters will need to be seen.
The addition to the bank’s BB & below-rated book in the June quarter also needs monitoring. 
The bank has added ₹2,242 crore to the stressed book (mainly exposures to groups that have newly exhibited signs of stress in recent months). Hence, while the chunk of corporate slippages (about half) in the June quarter have come from the stressed book, the parallel addition has kept the stressed pool constant at about ₹7,500 crore."

13,2019-09-10,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank plans to focus on rural markets 


Private sector lender Axis Bank is focussing on rural markets as part of a strategy to deepen its retail business.
Pralay Mondal, who joined the private sector lender in April this year as Executive Director, Retail Banking, remains upbeat about the retail franchise, but said that the consumption story has slowed down as people are deferring purchases.
“This is an opportunity for me to take ahead a good franchise. The country is going to grow, though right now it may be a bit of a challenge. But consumption is our story and within that, private banks are taking market share over a period of time, especially in the retail segment,” he told BusinessLine, adding that the lender will focus on about six key areas in its retail business.
Axis Bank, which is the country’s third-largest private sector lender, is now deepening its geographical reach and has already started a pilot in six districts for rural customers. 
The idea is to use its branches to offer all products to the customer by leveraging its businesses of rural lending (micro finance, KCC, tractors) and retail assets (two-wheeler and auto loans, LAP, personal loans, and credit cards).
Mandal said Axis Bank hopes to roll out this model in about 40 locations over the next six months and take it across the country in a year’s time. “We want to look at rural markets as a strategy. We have to learn from FMCG companies,” said Mondal.
Simultaneously, the lender is also looking to deepen its customer engagement and have “quality customer acquisition”. While it has not set a target, it is keen on getting a larger wallet share of the customer. It currently has about 2.5 crore customers. As on June 30, 2019, the bank’s retail book grew 22 per cent annually and retail loans comprised 52 per cent of the overall loan book.
Mondal, who is on the board of Axis Bank as well as Axis Securities and Axis Finance, also wants to use the expertise of all the subsidiaries of the lender, including those such as Freecharge, and also create more of a One Axis brand and cross-sell to customers. “Each of the subsidiaries can grow with support of the bank, and the bank can also use their expertise,” he said, pointing out that often customers don’t even know all the products available with the bank. 
When asked about the recent slowdown in consumption, he said the bank’s portfolio has not been hit, but noted that on the whole people are deferring purchases. “There is a little bit of slowdown in the ecosystem, but I don’t think there is a lack of confidence. People are optimistic, but they are asking what is the big hurry to buy,” he said, adding that it is sentiment-driven."

Axis Bank has set its sights on scaling up its subsidiaries, besides growing advances by 5 to 6 percentage points above the industry average, according to Amitabh Chaudhry, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. Chaudhry, who took charge of the bank on January 1, in an interview to BusinessLine, said the bank can potentially gain market share in advances due to the amalgamation of public sector banks. He opined that non-banking finance companies are currently going through a huge churn, and some of the weak ones will get caught out. Excerpts:
What growth opportunities do you see in the current market?
We have about 4.5 per cent market share in savings bank deposits and advances. In the case of term deposits, we were behind (the curve), but now we have caught up. So, the size of Axis Bank in comparison to the overall size of the market is quiet small….My basic notion is that if we have to get a little bit of market share, we can continue to get growth for the longest period of time and still not shake the market. So, because we are where we are, that itself is an opportunity. In the context of what is happening in public sector banks (PSBs) – the mergers are a good thing – but if you analyse the history, you will notice that when a merger happens, they go through their own challenges.
Every bank has its own culture, and it takes time for the amalgamated entity to settle down. There is some market share anyway, which is shifting from PSBs to private sector banks. Some of these banks might go through a slightly longer period of being unsettled.
So, we potentially gain more market share….There is an opportunity. If we can get our act right, we can gain some more market share because some of the (PSB) customers might feel that they are not being serviced, or when a consolidation of (loan) facilities happens, the consolidated bank might tell the customer that since our consolidated exposure is too high we would like to reduce it. So, opportunity can be there for a bank like Axis.
The Indian economy is growing even though at a lower rate, and that itself provides opportunities. So, every which way you look at it, the opportunities are huge.
Are there any gaps in products and services that you
are looking to fill?
Now, Axis Bank has been a pretty large player on the wholesale side for a long period. On the retail side, we have very successfully built the business over the last 10 years or so.
There are several product categories where we didn’t have a presence. For example, we just launched two-wheeler and consumer durables financing business. So, there are a couple of product categories where our presence is still quiet small. And, there are a lot of product categories where our ranking is still no 4 or 5.
So, we have to catch up and try to be among the top 3. So, opportunities are all over. Then our subsidiaries are sub-scale in the sense that our mutual fund is ranked number 9; Axis Finance, which has an AUM of ₹8,000 crore, is in an environment where it can grow; Axis Capital is doing quiet quiet well; and Axis Securities is ranked number 5, but it can move up the ranking scale.
So, there is an opportunity to grow each of the subsidiaries. I am very optimistic about what the (Axis) platform is and what it can become over a period of time. Now, it all depends on how we execute going forward.
Can you throw some light on you business growth plans?
We will grow at a rate which is at least 5-6 percentage points higher than the average industry growth.
If you look at our second quarter results, our domestic advances grew 19 per cent, while the industry grew at sub-10 per cent level….At the same time, we added 190 branches last quarter. And that is the highest that we added in the last 24 quarters.
So, while other banks keep talking about how they are going to increase the number of branches, we have actually, very quietly, gone and done it. And, hopefully, we will keep doing that only rather than talk about it.
So, we are focussed on the retail side. We continue to expand our retail franchise. At the same time, on the wholesale side also, we are trying to increase business. We want to take a conservative stand vis-a-vis our overall risk profile and underwriting on this front.
Axis Bank made a net loss
due to direct tax asset provisions. Will you be
back in profit next quarter?
Yes, of course. We have mentioned that our net profit would have been up by 100 per cent if not for the DTA. Hopefully, things will go up and we will be back on a similar track. We have said our slippages have remained elevated, but we are doing quite well on operating metrics, and I don’t see why that will change dramatically.
How are you addressing stakeholders’ concerns
about slippages?
We have a large stock (of stressed assets), and we have not completely worked out a way through that. And given the current economic environment, some of the stock is slipping into NPL (non-performing loan) faster than what was anticipated. But, ultimately, the overall stock is coming down and hopefully in three years our credit cost will come down to below 1 per cent because the hope and belief is that we are now underwriting assets of a qualit,y which is significantly a step up to what we were doing earlier. In the short term, what will happen to some of the corporates is still very unclear. We have to watch, but the confidence is that the size of the problem is coming down.
Are you still funding the cash-strapped and NPA-hit NBFC sector?
With the right kind of management, where the disclosures are good, where we believe that the risks are better managed, we are going ahead and lending more. But where we believe that the risks are higher and disclosures are less/ transparency is not full, we would like to ensure that we can get out of that problem. But if everyone starts rushing to the door, then we might not be able to get out. So, we have to manage it. And I think every bank is looking at it and trying to manage it. But definitely, no new funding will flow to such NBFCs. If no new funding comes through, whatever money NBFCs collect will go to repay the banks. Then, NBFCs are literally shut for business and they become a closed book. So, what happens is that the valuation goes for a toss. If this happens, the ability of NBFCs to raise capital becomes suspect…So, NBFCs are going through a huge churn. And in that churn, some of the weak ones will get caught out."

 Axis Bank is setting aside more capital, more than twice over the regulatory requirements, for loans in sectors it has identified as “stressed”, a senior official has said.
The bank is maintaining a standard asset provisioning of 1 percentage point for bad loans in such sectors, as against the regulatory provision of 0.40 per cent, its executive director Rajiv Anand told PTI.
The move, which is being followed at least since April, comes amid continuing concerns on high quantum of non-performing assets in its book. The high level of NPAs and the ensuing provisioning have impacted the profits of a majority of lenders, including Axis Bank, over the past four years. “In sectors identified as high risk, we have increased the standard provisioning to 100 bps as against the mandated 40 bps to take care of any concerns,” Anand said.
In April 2019, the bank had first disclosed that it had started to provide extra capital, but had not given out the exact levels of the additional provisioning or spelled out the sectors. 
When asked if the troubled sectors like real estate or non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) are included on the list, Anand declined to specify the sectors which the bank has identified as stressed. “We have not closed lending to any sector because of the difficulties that it may be going through. In each sector, there are always strong names which is better rated and has a resilient business model,” Anand made it clear.
Concerns on higher capital burn due to policies like these can be placated by ensuring that the lending to a particular sector is not very high, which is decided by an internal team. Anand said the bank has overhauled its risk assessment framework, wherein loan origination is separated from underwriting, and has a chief credit officer reporting directly to the chief executive.
Amid reports of its larger rival ICICI Bank shuttering its project finance, Anand hinted that Axis Bank is also following a similar strategy. “We generally avoid project finance and our focus is now much more towards cash flow generating businesses and look at the relationship in a manner where we can deliver the full capabilities of our group to the customer,” he said.
Anand avoided a direct reply when asked if there is demand from greenfield projects, but said it will not be apt to classify the loans merely as refinance, adding it is witnessing working capital demand as well.
The bank is targeting to grow its overall book 5-8 per cent above the system average, and that private sector banks have been garnering a higher percentage of market share in both loans and deposits lately whereas state-owned banks still are starved of growth capital.
In the comments that come amid difficulties on asset quality or mergers plaguing public sector banks, Anand said over half of the incremental liabilities are coming to the private sector banks, while in loans, the share is at a much higher 75 per cent.
On the macro economic prospects, Anand pins hopes on more monetary easing and growth-enhancing measures put forth by the government, but concedes that the second half will also be difficult. The pick-up will be visible from the first half of FY21, he said, on the back of growth slipping to an over six-year low of 4.5 per cent for the September quarter."

The outlook for the stock of Axis Bank (Rs 752.25) is positive. It finds an immediate support at Rs 715 and a crucial one at Rs 660. If the current trend sustains and if the stock rules above Rs 732, it has the potential to reach Rs 1,020.
We expect the stock to maintain the current bullish trend.
Axis Bank December futures has been seeing unwinding of open interest in the last four days. From a high of about 5.6 crore shares, open interest fell to 5.20 crore shares. However, January contract has added open positions, signalling a healthy rollover by traders.
Option trading indicates a support at Rs 720.
Traders can consider going long on Axis Bank futures with a stop loss at Rs 732. The stop-loss can be shifted to Rs 750 if the stock opens on positive note and stays well above this mark on Monday. Investors, who have patience with risk taking ability, can rollover positions and aim for a target of Rs 815 initially.
Alternatively, traders could consider a calendar bull-call spread strategy. This can be done by selling RS 750-call of this month and simultaneously buying the same option of next month. They closed with a premium of Rs 16.65 and Rs 34.65 respectively. This will cost traders Rs 18/contract or Rs 21,600, as the market lot is 1,200 shares.
A maximum loss is the premium paid (Rs 18), profit potentials are unlimited. If the stock closes at or below Rs 750, loss will occur. On the other hand, a close above Rs 768 will start turn the position positive.We advice traders to hold it for at least two weeks."
