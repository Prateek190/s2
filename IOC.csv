99,2018-01-09,IOC,"Why IOC sees no e-vehicles threat
The talk of complete phase out of fossil fuel powered vehicles by 2030 and the possible dominance of the roads by electric vehicles does not seem to have ruffled India’s biggest oil refiner, Indian Oil Corporation, which says it will continue to make business-as-usual plans for its future.
“Give me one reason why you will buy electric vehicles,” said IOC’s Director-Finance, A K Sharma, in a chat with a select group of journalists here recently. He observed that the Indian customer is a “value buyer” and would look carefully at the economics of the purchase, pointing out that even diesel cars were not preferred as they cost more.
Providing a quick, back-of-the-envelope calculation of the economics of electric vehicles, Sharma said that only a few “high-end customers and environment enthusiasts” will buy electric vehicles.
“Where is the market?” Sharma wondered.
Defending the $40-billion, 55-million-tonne mega refinery that is being put up in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra jointly by IOC and two other government-owned refiners, HPCL and BPCL, Sharma noted that the demand for petroleum products were going up by 4.5 per cent every year. This, he said, works out to 8-9 million tonnes additional demand every year, or about 50-60 million tonnes before the new refinery comes up — in about six-seven years. “Who will meet the demand?” posed Sharma, adding that if the country’s refiners went by what was being said about electric vehicles and did not invest in creating additional refining capacity, the country would face a shortage of petroleum products.




Nor was Sharma too worried about Railways’ plans for phasing out diesel locomotives in five years, (as was mentioned by the Railways Minister Piyush Goyal, last month in his address to the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry). Sharma observed that electrification of the Railways had been going on and any drop in diesel demand due to electrification had been offset by increase in railway traffic.




IOC (like other oil refining companies) is facing a rather unique situation with regard to the new ‘goods and service tax’ regime. About 60 per cent of its products, including petrol, diesel, natural gas and aviation fuel, is outside the purview of GST, but the rest is within the ambit of the new taxation system. As a result, IOC is “saddled with dual compliance”, Sharma said.
However, more than the burden of dual compliance, IOC’s problem is that it gets no input tax credit on the GST paid on the raw material it uses for those products that are outside the GST regime. It also gets no input tax credit for some capital equipment it buys.
Sharma said the loss of this input tax credit works out to ₹2,000 crore for the products and another ₹2,200 crore for the capital equipment. IOC has approached both the central and state governments, with a proposal that the company should be allowed to offset the input tax against excise duty and state value-added tax.




Sharma said that IOC’s board has cleared the ₹27,000-crore, 9 million tonne refinery to be set up at Nagapattinam.
The existing 500,000-tonne Cauvery Basin Refinery, which belongs to IOC’s subsidiary, CPCL, will be scrapped and the new refinery will be put up there. As such, IOC foresees no land acquisition or environmental clearance issues. “The refinery will come up very fast,” Sharma said.
IOC’s LNG terminal, coming up at Ennore, north of Chennai, is also on track to be commissioned in December 2018, Sharma said."

Shares of oil marketing companies (OMCs) such as Hindustan Petroleum Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Indian Oil may come under pressure with crude oil prices zipping past the $66 mark at NYMEX, and $60 at ICE.
Though a stable rupee (against the greenback) is a comforting factor, further rise in crude oil prices could impact these companies heavily. However, ONGC and Reliance Industries could benefit as their refining margins would improve."
94,2018-01-09,IOC,"Local ship-owners face heat over new global rule on low- sulphur bunker


Higher cost Compliant fuel is expected to cost atleast 50 per cent more than the fuel oil that most ships currently burn




Higher cost Compliant fuel is expected to cost atleast 50 per cent more than the fuel oil that most ships currently burn


Local ship owners looking to grab charter contracts of more than five years from state-run oil firms are staring at the uncertainty and cost implications arising from a new global rule on using low sulphur content fuel oil.
Beginning January 1, 2020, ships must use fuel oil on board with a sulphur content of not more than 0.5 per cent m/m (mass/mass), a steep cut from the current global sulphur cap of 3.5 per cent m/m. Ships can meet the requirement by using low-sulphur compliant fuel oil or continue to use high sulphur fuel oil by fitting exhaust gas cleaning systems or scrubbers.
Local oil refiners have said it is not possible to produce low sulphur fuel oil by January 1, 2020.
Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), are looking to hire a very large crude carrier (VLCC) and a Suezmax carrier, respectively, for as much as seven years from local fleet owners in the first such long-term cargo support policy to be tried out in India.
Ships hired for the contracts will have to comply with the low sulphur regulations mandated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) from 2020 and “any modification/retrofitting required on the vessel to be carried out by vessel owner at their cost and time”, according to the tender issued by the state-run refiners.
Fitting scrubbers costs anywhere between $3 million and $8 million depending on the size of the ship is an additional cost to the owner, said a shipping industry consultant.
The new IMO rule on low sulphur cap poses significant challenges to oil refiners and on the economics of shipping — compliant fuel is expected to cost between 50 and 100 per cent more than the fuel oil that most ships currently burn.
In time charter contracts such as those of IOCL and BPCL, the charterer has to pay/reimburse voyage-related costs such as bunker and port charges to the ship owner. The tender stipulates that IOCL and BPCL will only reimburse the cost of intermediate fuel oil (IFO) 380 centistokes (CST) having a sulphur content of 3.5 per cent m/m.
“Either the ship owners will have to put scrubbers to continue using high sulphur content fuel oil or use fuel oil of 0.5 per cent m/m sulphur content which costs as much as $200 per tonne more than the 380 CST used by ships currently,” the shipping industry consultant said.




Bunker costs account for as much as 45 per cent of the voyage/operating cost of a ship and any increase in fuel oil consumption per day would entail huge extra costs.
For a VLCC, 1-2 tonnes more of fuel oil consumption per day, makes a big difference. A VLCC typically burns about 70-75 tonnes of fuel oil a day. Fuel oil of 3.5m/m sulphur content is available in India and currently costs about $350-400 a tonne. Extra consumption of 2 tonnes per day means additional cost of about $700-800 per day.
But, low sulphur fuel oil — it will not be available in India by 2020 — costs about $550-600 a tonne. If the VLCC consumes 2 tonnes more per day, the extra costs would be about $1,100-1,200 per day.
Further, the owners will have to spend more on operating costs, mainly port charges, to lift bunker from foreign ports as low sulphur fuel oil will not be available in India.
Both, IOCL and BPCL, would feel the impact of such extra costs because it would have to reimburse the port costs to the ship owner. Besides, with IOCL and BPCL permitting ships to use high sulphur fuel oil after fitting scrubbers, there is no incentive for local oil refiners to adopt the technology to produce low sulphur content bunker, the industry official said.
IOCL and BPCL would have benefitted from producing low sulphur fuel oil because they can supply it at cost price and not market price to the time charter contracts as it is for internal consumption."
98,2018-01-09,IOC,"IOC, BPCL set rates for VLCC, Suezmax tanker


Size is everything In the last five years, VLCC rates have touched $57,750 per day for a one-year charter and $45,000 per day for a three-year charter




Size is everything In the last five years, VLCC rates have touched $57,750 per day for a one-year charter and $45,000 per day for a three-year charter


Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) will benchmark the rates for a very large crude carrier (VLCC) and a Suezmax tanker, respectively, they plan to hire from local fleet owners for five years to the Clarksons index that are also subject to a floor (minimum rate) and a cap (maximum rate).
IOCL has set a floor rate of $18,000 per day and a cap of $40,000 per day for hiring a 10-year old VLCC that can carry as much as 265,000 million tonnes of Basrah light crude for five years with an option to extend the contract for two years, according to the tender reviewed by BusinessLine.
BPCL has set a floor rate of $15,000 per day and a cap of $27,000 per day for hiring a ten-year-old Suezmax tanker that can carry as much as 130,000 mt of crude oil for five years that is extendable by two years, according to the tender issued by BPCL.




The charter hire under the contracts will be linked to one-year time charter rates for 310,000 and 150,000 dead weight tonnes (dwt) vessels indicated in Clarksons Research’s Shipping Intelligence Weekly publication. This weekly market rate shall be averaged out considering all weekly publications during the preceding year from January 1 to Decmeber 31 to arrive at the base charter hire rate for the next year.
The fleet owners quoting the maximum discount or lowest premium in percentage on the base charter hire rate so determined will win the deal. The discount / premium agreed by ship owners shall be valid for the entire duration of contract including optional period. However, the base charter hire rate shall be reset every year based on immediate previous year’s average of one-year time charter rate indicated in Clarksons Research’s Shipping Intelligence Weekly publication.
For example, if the average of weekly market rates of one-year time charter published in Clarksons Research’s Shipping Intelligence Weekly publication during this yearthe year 2017 works out to $18,601 per day and the agreed premium is 10 per cent, the charter-hire payable to owners during 2018 shall be 18,601 + 10% = $20,461 per day. Assuming it to be discount, the payable charter-hire during 2018 shall be 18,601-10% = $16,741 per day.
However, if the charter hire net of agreed discount / premium works out to be less than floor rate, the charter hire payable shall be the floor rate. But, if the charter hire net of discount / premium works out to more than the cap rate, then the payable charter hire shall be the cap rate.
Such floor and cap rate will be valid for the entire contract period including optional period.
“It’s is a very aggressive floor and cap set by the state-run oil refiners,” says Pawan Gupta, an independent shipping consultant. “We had suggested a floor rate of $18,000 per day and a cap of $36,000 per day for the VLCC. IOCL made it $18,000 and $40,000. Actually, it is good for ship owners,” he said.
“It is not a win-win situation,” says another Mumbai-based shipping consultant. “It is not in favour of owners because if the market goes up, their ability to get a premium will be restricted to $40,000 for VLCC and $27,000 for Suezmax carriers”. Besides, for financing purposes, this model will be less attractive than a fixed rate. Banks will favour a fixed rate than the floor and cap rate because of the risks involved, he added.




The current market rate for hiring a VLCC for three years is $29,250 per day while the rate for a Suezmax carrier is $22,500 per day, according to Allied Shipping Research.
In the last five years, the VLCC rates had touched $ 57,750 per day for a one-year charter and $45,000 per day for a three-year charter.
In the case of Suezmax tankers, the rate had reached $42,500 per day for a one-year charter and $35,000 per day for a three-year charter."
96,2018-01-09,IOC,"Green tribunal dismisses plea against IOC’s LPG terminal at Puthuvypeen


A view of the LPG storage at Puthuvypeen. Indian Oil is stated to have suffered a loss of ₹1 crore per day on account of the delay caused




A view of the LPG storage at Puthuvypeen. Indian Oil is stated to have suffered a loss of ₹1 crore per day on account of the delay caused


The National Green Tribunal on Friday dismissed the application of the LPG Virudha Samara Samithi against Indian Oil Corporation’s LPG import terminal at Puthuvypeen near here.
In the application, the leaders of the Samara Samithi, wanted the tribunal to direct IOCL not to implement the project. However, the tribunal refused to countenance the demand.


No substance


The tribunal found no substance in the allegation that the project posed safety threats to the residents of the area.
It was also alleged in the application that the project site is closer to the High Tide Line than envisaged under the environmental clearance. Based on the submissions made before it, the Tribunal set aside these arguments as well.
The tribunal upheld Indian Oil’s contention that storage of LPG is a permitted activity at the seashore under the CRZ norms and hence the project does not in any way offend those norms. However, the tribunal has observed that the company may undertake sea protection measures to arrest erosion at the project site, a statement said.
With this, IOC has overcome all the legal hurdles to the project. Earlier, the tribunal had also dismissed the Samara Samithi’s appeal against the extension of environmental clearance to the project.
Samara Samithi preferred an appeal before the apex court against this. The Supreme Court, however, dismissed the appeal even without admitting the same.


‘Substantial loss’


Though there was no stay against developing the project, the Samara Samithi had been obstructing the development of the project for more than 10 months now. Indian Oil is stated to have suffered a loss of ₹1 crore per day on account of the delay.
The project was conceived to meet the increasing demand for LPG in the country. For now, the oil major is transporting LPG by road in bulk LPG carrier trucks from a similar facility at Mangaluru."
95,2018-01-09,IOC,"IOC, BPCL keen to acquire GAIL
Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) are both keen to acquire gas utility GAIL India Ltd to become fully integrated energy companies.
IOC and BPCL have separately indicated to the petroleum ministry their interest in taking over GAIL to help add natural gas transportation and marketing business to their kitty, official sources said.
GAIL, on the other hand, feels a merger with oil and gas producer ONGC would be more appropriate.
The merger options were indicated following Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s announcement in the 2017-18 Budget speech on the government’s plan to create integrated public sector oil majors that will be “able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies“.
ONGC, India’s largest oil and gas producer, proposed to acquire oil refiner and fuel marketing company HPCL, which was approved by the Cabinet. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is currently in the process of acquiring the government’s 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL, which at current prices is worth over Rs 33,000 crore.
Sources said IOC and BPCL gave separate options for the integration.
The government’s 54.89 per cent stake in GAIL is currently worth about Rs 46,700 crore.
Integration options suggested by other companies would be taken up only after ONGC-HPCL merger is complete, they said.
IOC, the largest oil refiner and fuel marketing company in the country, wanted to either acquire another refiner to add to its capacity or a gas company like GAIL.
The firm feels it already has a fledging gas business in under-construction LNG terminals, city gas distribution projects and gas marketing. GAIL, the nation’s biggest gas transporter and marketing company, would complement that, it felt.
BPCL on the other hand too has natural gas ambitions and wrote to the oil ministry saying GAIL was its number one choice for acquisition. It listed Oil India Ltd (OIL), the nation’s second largest exploration firm, as its number two choice."

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has got approval from the government for selling its stake in IOC and GAIL to help fund the ₹36,915 crore acquisition of HPCL.
ONGC holds 13.77 per cent stake in nation’s biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC), which at today’s trading price is worth over ₹26,200 crore. It also holds 4.86 per cent stake in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, which is worth over ₹3,847 crore.
Top sources with direct knowledge of the issue said the government gave ONGC nod to sell its shareholding in IOC and GAIL earlier this month but the company is waiting for the right price to offload the shares.
For the moment, ONGC is funding the ₹36,915-crore acquisition of government’s 51.11 per cent stake in oil refining and marketing firm Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) from the about ₹12,000 crore cash it has and short-term borrowing.
Sources said ONGC is a zero-debt company and wants to retain that status. The short-term loan it is availing have provision to pre-pay without any penalty.
It plans to pre-pay the one-year tenure loan it is taking for HPCL buy by selling IOC and GAIL shares in due course, they said.
Sources said ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corp of India (LIC) for selling IOC and GAIL shares but the state-owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10 per cent discount to the prevailing price.
So, ONGC has decided to offload the shares in open market.


Integrated oil company


ONGC acquiring HPCL would create India’s first integrated oil company. This would be ONGC’s biggest acquisition and second buyout this fiscal after its ₹ 7,738 crore acquisition of 80 per cent stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp’s KG basin gas block.
ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker had on Sunday stated that the company’s board has approved raising of the borrowing limit from ₹ 25,000 crore to ₹ 35,000 crore.
This will be the company’s first ever debt.
“We will use our (₹ 12,000-13,000 crore) cash first and then the liquid assets and debt will be last,” Shanker had said.
“This order can change, because we won’t sell the liquid assets in distress. Also, we have offers for over ₹50,000 crore debt at very competitive rates, both foreign currency and local.”
Shanker had said the company paid less than the acquisition price recommended by the company’s valuation adviser, EY.
He, however, refused to share details.


HPCL share valuation


The ₹473.97 per share ONGC is paying to the government is 14 per cent higher than Friday’s closing price of HPCL and over 10 per cent of the 60-day weighted average of the HPCL scrip.
Sources said while the government was seeking as much as ₹69,000 crore for selling controlling stake in HPCL, EY had put HPCL’s valuation at ₹475 a share plus a premium for getting the controlling stake. The outside advice the company took from Citi put the price at ₹500 per share.
The stake sale will help the government cross its sell-off target for the first time and would help stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.2 per cent of GDP.
The government had set a target of ₹72,500 crore from disinvestment proceeds this fiscal. Before the ONGC-HPCL deal, it had collected ₹54,337.60 crore.
HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC’s portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.
ONGC already is majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15-million tonne refinery."

Despite scepticism on the terms of the tender, ship owners such as Shipping Corporation of India Ltd, Great Eastern Shipping Co Ltd and Essar Shipping Ltd have applied on separate tenders issued by Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) to hire an oil super tanker and a Suezmax tanker, respectively, for five years each.
The tenders for the first long-term cargo support contracts to be tried out in India at the behest of the Central government, closed on January 22. The five-year contracts are designed to help shipowners raise funds at low rates to expand fleet.
The tenders incorporate a so-called right of first refusal to Indian shipowners — if Indian fleet owners are not the lowest bidders to haul the cargo, they are offered an opportunity to match the lowest rate quoted by a foreign ship-owner and take the contract.
IOC and BPCL will benchmark the rates for a very large crude carrier (VLCC) and a Suezmax tanker, respectively, they plan to hire to the Clarksons index which are also subject to a floor (minimum rate) and a cap (maximum rate).
IOC has set a floor rate of $18,000 a day and a cap of $40,000 a day for hiring a 10-year old VLCC that can carry as much as 265,000 million tonnes (MT) of Basrah light crude for five years with an option to extend the contract for two years, according to the tender reviewed by BusinessLine.
BPCL has set a floor rate of $15,000 per day and a cap of $27,000 per day for hiring a 10-year old Suezmax tanker that can carry as much as 130,000 mt of crude oil for five years which is extendable by two years, according to the tender issued by BPCL.
The charter hire under the contracts will be linked to one-year time charter rates for 310,000 and 150,000 dead weight tonnes (dwt) vessels indicated in Clarksons Research’s Shipping Intelligence Weekly publication. This weekly market rate shall be averaged out considering all weekly publications during the preceding year from January 1 to December 31 to arrive at the base charter hire rate for the next year.
The fleet owners quoting the maximum discount or lowest premium in percentage on the base charter hire rate so determined will win the deal.
The discount / premium agreed by ship owners shall be valid for the entire duration of contract, including optional period. However, the base charter hire rate shall be reset every year based on immediate previous year’s average of one-year time charter rate indicated in Clarksons Research’s Shipping Intelligence Weekly publication.
Besides, the state-run oil refiners have set a 10-year age limit for qualifying ships because by the time the five-year contract ends, the ships will be 15-years-old, reaching the threshold prescribed by most of the crude oil loading terminals globally, particularly for VLCCs.
To be sure, fleet owners who don’t have the requisite ships while submitting offers are allowed by IOC and BPCL to participate in the tender by showing relevant proof of acquisition of such ships, which should be converted into Indian flag within six months of winning the contract.
“The returns matrix will not work out for this type of floating rate contracts,” said an executive with an Indian shipping company that has rented ships to oil refiners. “It is not a financially viable proposal for anybody including the banks,” he said."

 Indian Oil Corporation will invest Rs 3,400 crore in Assam over the next five years to expand its operations by setting up new units as well as upgrading the existing ones, a senior IOC official has said.
The company will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Assam Government to this effect at the two-day ‘Advantage Assam - Global Investors Summit 2018’, beginning here today, the official said.
“We are signing an MoU with the State Government that will empower us to invest Rs 3,400 crore in Assam over the next five years. This will be for various projects across the state,” Indian Oil Corporation, Executive Director (IndianOil-AOD), Dipankar Ray, told PTI.
The board has already approved the funding and it may increase in future depending upon the progress of the work.
“Major chunk of this will go for expansion of our refinery capacities. We are going to add new units and also upgrade the existing ones to improve the fuel quality and BS-VI compliant fuel will be required as per norms,” Ray said.
The company will also enhance the capacity of its LPG bottling plants at North Guwahati, Silchar and Mirza. “The petroleum storage capacities are also being enhanced at various places like Barak valley and Digboi. In Barak valley, we are setting up a new depot, which will be well-connected by rail network and will have a provision for pipeline connectivity as well,” Ray said.
Besides, IOC’s existing depots at Betkuchi in Guwahati, Lumding and Missamari will see capacity expansion under this project, he added.
“Some projects under this MoU have already started, while some will begin soon. These projects will also help create jobs, mostly in contract through indirect route,” Ray said."

Pramod Saxena, CMD, Oxigen Services




Over the last twelve months, Oxigen Services has deployed 20,000 micro-ATMs in various industries across the country.




 Oxigen Services, a non-bank payment services provider, has entered into a strategic tie-up with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) to expand and deploy new micro-ATMs at IOCL's fuel station network, pan India.
Over the next one year, Oxigen targets to deploy micro-ATMs at 10,000 IOCL retail outlets across states, potentially yielding 8-10 million transactions and gross transaction value of $1 billion this coming year.
Speaking to BusinessLine in this tie-up, Pramod Saxena, Founder & CMD, Oxigen Service, said that this is a significant deal because petrol stations generate huge amount of business and largest single point value creators in terms of payment acceptance.
Encouraged by the success of the pilot programme launched in May 2017 involving 200 IOCL outlets, Oxigen has now gone in for this tie-up with IOCL, Saxena said.
Under this tie-up, Oxigen and IOCL outlets will provide services of branchless banking through these micro-ATMs (basically Point of Sale machines). Customers can avail themselves of banking services, do digital payments and recharge IOCL's Xtrapower fleetcard account, by paying in cash or vis debit card or BHIM Aadhaar Pay. They can pay for fuel and other purchases, and also as an ATM for cash withdrawal by customers using Aadhaar, according to Saxena.
IOCL in India has over 25,000 petrol stations and are big users and holders of cash. Post demonetisation, oil companies have been looking to digitise their operations so that cash based transactions are minimised in majority of their locations.
""Our micro-ATMs will enable IOC to remove lot of cash in their operations and digitise. Now that we have done the pilot, we know all the processes and expect to deploy all the 10,000 in about a one year"", Saxena said.
Over the last twelve months, Oxigen Services has deployed 20,000 micro-ATMs in various industries across the country. 
Talks are also now on with other oil companies to see if similar tie-ups like the one entered into with IOCL can be achieved, Saxena added. "" ""There is no exclusivity pact with IOCL. We are free to provide our Micro-ATM services with others also"", he added.

Indian Oil Corporation will lay five underground pipelines of about 22 km between its Ennore and Korukkupet terminals in the northern part of Chennai at an estimated cost of about ₹730 crore.
“The proposal is waiting for approvals and we will start work once we get the clearances, said Anish Aggarwal, Director – Pipelines, Indian Oil Corporation, after dedicating three new multi-product pipelines that have been re-routed between Chennai Port and Korukkupet terminal at a cost of ₹98 crore.
The proposed new pipelines project between Ennore and Korukkupet terminals will help save transport costs and secure flexibility to adjust fuel supplies according to market demand, said Rakesh Sehgal, Executive Director – Operations, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
Earlier, explaining the re-routing of pipelines, Aggarwal said it will help in safe transfer of products between Chennai Port and Korukkupet terminals.
“This will provide a lot of flexibility to our operations. The old underground pipelines (for a distance of 5 km) were operating for nearly four decades and they have been re-routed as huge inhabitation has taken place over these years. Maintenance also became difficult,” he said.
To make the operations safe, three new pipelines were laid underground along the railway route for white oil products such as petrol and diesel, black oil products (fuel oil) and lube oils. These pipelines have been provided with higher thickness as a stronger safety measure. Also, features such as optical fibre cable (for data transfer), leak detection, surge relief, thermal relief system and automatic shutdown facility are also part of this new pipeline project. “Now, we will be able to use these lines for import and export activities. This will definitely help the Chennai region meet the fuel requirements in case CPCL refinery is shut down for maintenance or other activities,” he said.
The re-routing work has been completed in about 18 month’s time."

 After undertaking first-of-a-kind step of Aadhaar enrolment through one of its rural outlets (Kisan Seva Kendra) in Manipur, IOCL is planning to scale up the exercise in other parts of the State following robust response.
With 211 people benefiting from two Aadhaar enrolment camps at one of its rural outlets in January and February this year, IOCL is now looking at similar camps in other outlets.
“Imphal Divisional Office of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd is also planning to organise such specific social engagement programme in the near future for the benefit of the society in addition to selling petroleum products,” IOCL Deputy General Manager (Retail Sales), Imphal Divisional Office, S I Singh told PTI.
IOCL in collaboration with State Bank of India-Aadhaar Enrolment Service had organised the first two enrolment camps at its Kisan Seva Kendra at Lamsang, he added.
Singh, who is also the State Level Coordinator, Oil Industry, Manipur, said the initiative has also received appreciation from the State Government, which has asked the company to encourage other outlets of IOCL in the State to undertake such similar exercises.
Elaborating on the scope of scaling up the exercise, he said there are 89 outlets in the State, 71 from IOCL, 14 from BPCL and 4 from Essar Oil. Apart from enrolment, villagers and general public also got the opportunity for rectification of Aadhaar as well during the first two camps, he said, adding that more than 40 school children also participated in the social engagement programme."

A PTI report said Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum may buy 26 per cent stake each in gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd, paying the government over Rs 20,000 crore each to become integrated energy firms.
IOC and BPCL may split the government's stake in GAIL equally among themselves making it their subsidiary, and GAIL will continue to operate as a listed company with an independent board, the report said. IOC, BPCL and GAIL are unrelated businesses and since the government needs money they are forcing IOC and BPCL to pay out for its stake in GAIL, Nitin Tiwari, an analyst with Antique Stockbroking, said.
Also, IOC and BPCL have a fair amount of debt on their balance sheets and on top of that they will be adding more debt to pay for the transaction, so there is a negative implication related to that, Tiwari added.

79,2018-04-08,IOC,"IOC in a medium-term downtrend
Here are answers to readers’ queries on the performance of their stock holdings.
What are the medium and long-term supports and resistances for the stock of Indian Oil Corporation?
Samar Kaushik
Indian Oil Corporation (₹174.5): The long-term trend has been up for the stock of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) since taking support at around ₹50 (adjusted) in 2013. This uptrend will remain in place as long as the stock trades above ₹140. Investors with a long-term perspective can stay invested with a stop-loss at ₹130.
However, after recording a new high at ₹231 in August 2017, the stock changed direction and has been on a medium-term downtrend. While trending down, the stock breached key supports at ₹200 and ₹184. Even the short-term trend is down for the stock. But there is a key support in the ₹160-165 band, which can provide cushion in the short to medium term.








 
 
If the stock plunges below this base, it can decline to ₹150 and ₹140 levels. Investors with a long-term horizon can make use of such dips to buy the stock with the stop-loss mentioned earlier. A decisive rally above the immediate resistances at ₹184 and ₹190 is needed to alter the short-term downtrend and take the stock up to ₹200 and ₹205.
An upward breakthrough of the significant resistance at ₹205 is needed to change the medium-term downtrend and take it northwards to ₹220 and ₹230 levels in the long run.
What are the short-to-medium term prospects for HEG & Graphite India. Can these shares be purchased at current rates?
Wasudeo Pat
HEG (₹2,942.6): The stock of HEG has been a multi-bagger in the last one year. However, after recording a new high at ₹3,514 in late March this year, the stock began to decline and witnessed selling pressure.
Since this January, the stock has been in a sideways movement, broadly in the ₹2,200-₹3,200 range. A downward break of the immediate support level of ₹2,500 can pull the stock down to ₹2,200. Further declines below the lower boundary can mitigate the uptrend and drag the stock down to ₹2,000 and then to ₹1,600 levels. Take a cautious approach and desist taking positions at this juncture.
Graphite India (₹720.4): This stock has also been a multi-bagger over past year. After a new high at ₹908 in early January this year, the stock began to trend downwards. But a support at ₹600 provided base in February. Then, the stock began to remain range-bound between ₹600 and ₹800.








 
 
A strong rally above 800 in required to take the stock higher to ₹860 and ₹900 levels. However, if it tumbles below ₹600, it will bring back bearish momentum and pull the share down to ₹550 and ₹450 levels.

Taking another step towards making the proposal for a mega refinery in the country’s west coast a reality, an Indian consortium consisting of Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation signed an MoU with Saudi Aramco here on the sidelines of the16 International Energy Forum Ministerial. 
Speaking to mediapersons after signing of the MoU to jointly develop and build an integrated refinery and petrochemicals complex, Ratnagiri Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, in Maharashtra, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Dharmendra Pradhan, said, “The project cost is estimated at around ₹3 lakh crore ($44 billion). The refinery will be capable of processing 1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day (60 million tonnes per annum).”
The project will be set up as a 50:50 joint partnership (50:50) between the consortium from India and Saudi Aramco, Pradhan said. The plan is to finish the project by 2025.
Khalid Al Falih, Minister for Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, Saudi Arabia, who was present on the occasion, said: “Saudi Aramco may include a strategic partner to co-invest in the project”. 
Elaborating on the refinery project, he said, the partnership brings together crude supply, resources, technologies, experience and expertise of multiple oil companies with an established commercial presence around the world.
A pre-feasibility study for the refinery has been completed, and the parties are now finalising the project’s overall configuration including the formation of a joint venture that would provide for joint ownership, control and management of the project.
In addition to the refinery, cracker and downstream petrochemicals facilities, the project will also include the development of associated facilities such as a logistics, crude oil and product storage terminals, raw water supply project and centralised and shared utilities.
Amin H. Nasser, Saudi Aramco’s President and CEO, said participating in the mega project will allow the Saudi Arabian oil company to go beyond the role of crude oil supplier to a fully integrated position which supports India’s future energy demands. 
It will produce a range of refined petroleum products, including petrol and diesel meeting BS-VI fuel efficiency norms. The refinery will also provide feedstock for the integrated petrochemicals complex, which will be capable of producing approximately 18 million tonnes per annum of petrochemical products."

 Three major public sector oil companies today announced that they would be distributing 70,000 LPG connections in the state on April 20 to households living Below Poverty Line (BPL).
“To popularise the use of clean fuel for cooking among the rural population of the country, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has decided to celebrate April 20 as Ujjwala Diwas,” said Executive Director, Gujarat, Indian Oil Corporation, S S Lamba, at a press meet here today.
On that day, around 15,000 ‘LPG panchayats’ will be held across the country under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), Lamba said.
“In Gujarat, distributors of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) would organise 701 such LPG panchayats on April 20. Our target is to give around 70,000 new LPG connections by enrolling 100 beneficiaries at each of these 701 community gatherings” said Lamba, who is also the state level coordinator of oil marketing companies in Gujarat.
 “LPG panchayat will serve as an interactive platform between existing customers, officials and those who are interested to switch to LPG. Each meeting is aimed at bringing together 500 women from nearby areas and thereby providing 100 new connections at each of these panchayats on that day” he said.
Since its launch in May 2016 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, around 12.75 lakh LPG connections under the PMUY scheme have been provided to eligible BPL beneficiaries in Gujarat, where the total number of LPG connections stood at 85 lakh, he said.
He said as many as 3.58 crore LPG connections have been provided to BPL families across the country since the programme was launched.
 “When the scheme was launched in 2016, our target was 5 crore connections, out of which, we have enrolled 3.58 crore already. However, from this month, the target has been revised to 8 crore, to be covered by 2020, due to the addition of seven new categories who can be covered under the scheme” said Lamba."

The expansion is a part of revised targets to increase the refining capacity from 15 million tonne per annum to 25 mtpa by 2023-2024 for the refinery.
A company official said: “We are spending ₹3,292 crore to upgrade from producing BS IV grade fuel to BS VI grade fuel. Another ₹765 crore will be spent for setting up a 100-kilo-litre per day 2G ethanol plant that uses rice straw-based biowaste by April 2020.”
According to IndianOil, the company is going to set up a 128-KL per day 3G ethanol project that uses gas fermentation technology from Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) off gases (containing CO, H2 and CO2) in Panipat. This project is expected to cost ₹441 crore.
“Approvals are awaited for expanding petrochemical manufacturing capacity with an investment of ₹967 crore. We are also considering setting up projects for domestic manufacturing of catalysts with an investment of ₹217 crore,” the official added.
Petcoke production
Since it largely processes heavy crudes, the Panipat refinery also has substantive petcoke production through its 0.9 million tonne per year coker unit. The consumption of petcoke by the cement industry is on the rise after the Supreme Court order of December 2017 allowed its use as a feedstock. Petcoke consumption registered a growth of 9.3 per cent in the financial year 2017-2018, according to the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.
Fuel refiners across the country, however, are moving towards lowering petcoke production. “We are coming out with products to substitute petcoke. The objective is to minimise its production,” the official said.

Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd (CPCL), a subsidiary of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, will incur a capital expenditure of ₹1,000 crore for 2018-19 to support various ongoing projects. 
“CPCL is implementing a number of projects to improve reliability, profitability and meet BS VI product quality specification,” said S N Pandey, Managing Director, CPCL.
In all, the total cost of those projects that are under implementation is estimated at ₹2,540 crore.
The new crude oil pipeline project is expected to be mechanically completed by July, the BS-VI project during 2019-20 and the RLNG (re-gasified liquefied natural gas) project will be completed in phases from November 2018 onwards.
The CPCL board has given its in-principle approval for the proposed 9 million tonnes refinery at Cauvery Basin, Nagapattinam, in Tamil Nadu, at a cost of ₹27,450 crore. Preparation of Detailed Feasibility Report is on and is expected to be completed by March 2019.

Sanjiv Singh, Chairman, IOC




Sanjiv Singh, Chairman, IOC


Asserting that the latest round of auto fuel price hikes was mainly driven by global developments, Indian Oil Chairman Sanjiv Singh on Tuesday said the government has so far not issued any directive on holding back fuel price hikes.
He also maintained that the reason the OMCs had held back price increases in the 19 days prior to the Karnataka election was because they expected global benchmark prices to soften. However, that did not happen, and so now the OMCs had to go in for steep price hikes, Singh told reporters.
The government has not asked IndianOil to hold back the price hike post Karnataka election, according to Singh.
Asked why prices had not been hiked for 19 days close to the election, Singh told BusinessLine, “There is no directive from the government as far as the retail price is concerned. Regarding the 19 days, retail prices are driven by the last 15-day global prices of the products. And product prices invariably move in the direction (of) global crude prices, although sometimes there might be differences. During the 19-day period, the spikes on a daily basis were happening and it was likely that the price would not have gone the same way.”
He added: “We decided to moderate prices for a reasonable period; subsequently, we saw that other geopolitical developments were determining crude prices. And that is why not only the crude, even the product prices are moving beyond anybody’s expectation; this is probably reflecting in the retail prices also.”
Industry watchers have pointed out that despite officially allowing oil marketing PSUs to freely price petrol and diesel, the government has been nudging them to hold prices for political considerations. This was highlighted in the run-up to Assembly elections in Gujarat and Karnataka.
Before the Karnataka election, benchmark international rates for petrol moved up from $78.84 a barrel to $82.98 but the retail prices were held at the same levels.
‘Govt taking steps’
Later, addressing journalists, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan said, “I have been loud enough to raise my voice. The government is concerned and is taking the appropriate steps.”
Pradhan, however, did not specify what steps the government is planning or the timeline to implementthem. The government has said it will take some action to ease the burden on consumers."

BL06_13_CYLINDER_3140337f


 Subsidised cooking gas price was hiked by Rs 2.71 a cylinder today as a result of tax impact of base price rising due to spurt in international rates and fall in rupee.
 Subsidised LPG with effect from midnight tonight will cost Rs 493.55 in Delhi, a statement issued by Indian Oil Corp (IOC) said.
 Oil firms revise LPG price on 1st of every month based on average benchmark rate and foreign exchange rate in the previous month.
 “The increase is mainly on account of GST on revised price of Domestic Non-Subsidised LPG,” the statement said.
 As a result of higher global rates, the price of Non-Subsidized LPG at Delhi will increase by Rs 55.50 a cylinder.
 “The balance Rs.52.79 (Rs.55.50 minus Rs.2.71) is being compensated to the customer by increase in subsidy transfer to their bank account. Accordingly, the subsidy transfer in customer’s bank account has been increased to Rs 257.74 per cylinder in July 2018 as against Rs 204.95 per cylinder in June 2018. Thus the domestic LPG customer is protected against the increase in international prices of LPG,” the statement said.

 IndianOil has partnered Fortum India, part of the Finland-based FortumOYJ, to roll out its first electric vehicle (EV) charging station at a retail outlet in Hyderabad.
It plans to set up 50 such EV charging stations at its outlets in the city.
This is IndianOil’s first such charging station in the country aimed at public use; it had earlier installed two demo stations for the NTPC and the NBCC, for use within their facility, and in Nagpur, with a cab operator.
Nina Vaskunlahti, the Finnish Ambassador to India, launched the facility by virtually charging an electric vehicle. The outlet is located at Goldstrike Fuel and Services on Raj Bhavan Road.
A company-owned and company-operated outlet at Begumpet was also facilitated with EV charging unit.
Awadhesh Kumar Jha, Vice-President, Fortum India, said, “Plans are on to set up 150-200 such stations in the country during the year.”
“After the pilot phase, we plan to set up 50 such stations in Hyderabad over the next two years,” said Rahul Bharadwaj, Executive Director of IndianOil for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
Jayesh Ranjan, Principal Secretary, Industries and Commerce, Telangana, said, “Hyderabad is among the six light-house cities chosen by the NITI Aayog to take up pilot initiatives on electric vehicles.”

Petronet LNG, IndianOil and BPCL among other oil companies will soon put up close to 20 LNG stations on various national highways. 
Speaking at a Conference on City Gas Distribution in India organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Director (Finance) at Petronet LNG, V K Mishra said that tenders for these stations would be issued in the next 15 days.
He said that this association of oil companies has also fructified on a pilot project base to feed roughly 5,000 trucks with LNG on leading five national highways, beginning 2019.
“Following its successful experiment, this exercise would have a repeat in subsequent year of 2020 for another estimated 5,000 trucks that can run on national highways on LNG with a fuel cost saving of nearly 25 per cent as well effectively addressing the issue of fuel pollution”, Mishra said. 
The required permission to put up such LNG distribution centre on national highways has been given. 
In order to broad base the exercise of running trucks on LNG fuel to begin with and subsequently passenger buses also on the same fuel on national highways, the oil companies have already asked the truck manufacturers such as TATAs and Mahendras to accordingly make such trucks as can be fuelled with cheaper and cleaner fuel such as LNG."

 Use of LPG, which until recently was confined to kitchen and for cooking only, is now being tried to power iron box. 
 Indian Oil Corporation has made a beginning by launching it here on Thursday, after tremendous response for the LPG powered iron box in Maharashtra and Kerala. 
Alexie Joseph, Senior Area Manager, IOCL - LPG, Coimbatore said, “The LPG-fuelled iron-box will not only prove to be handy for the commercial roadside launderer, but is eco-friendly and economical as well. The istriwala can press 1,300 garments using a 5-kg commercial cylinder.” 
“A Pune-based company developed this product. IOC has sourced three-models of these irons priced between ₹2,500 and ₹7,000 for distribution. At 6.5 kg, the iron box is slightly heavier than the 6-kg conventional iron box.
The cylinder is connected to the iron box using an insulated gas tube. The heat can be controlled using the switch on the iron box.
Stating that the LPG-fuelled iron box has been rolled out in Tiruchi besides Coimbatore, Joseph said IOCL is reaching out to istriwalas to promote this eco-friendly tool. Launderers can produce an identity card and get the cylinder, she added."

 Besides, the LPG-fuelled iron box would also cut down on the preparatory and cleaning time by upto two hours compared to charcoal-based iron, he claimed.
 The LPG-powered iron box is priced at Rs 7,000.
 Costing around Rs 400 for the gas, the increase in productivity naturally results in an increase in profitability to the ‘istriwallahs,’ dealers and vendors, Sitharthan said.

49,2018-08-29,IOC,"Ready with Plan B if US sanctions stop Iran crude supplies: Indian Oil chief 
ndia’s biggest state-run oil refiner Indian Oil said on Wednesday it has lined up alternative crude supplies if it is to cut down purchases from Iran after November 4, when the new sanctions imposed by the US take effect.
“We have alternative options available 100 per cent so that our refineries are not short of crude and the country is not short of energy. Let see how it goes — we are perfectly fine with whatever is decided by the country,” Indian Oil Chairman Sanjiv Singh at a media conference.
The company “faced some issues” in buying crude from Iran, “but we found out some solution also to deal with it”, he added.
“We don’t know how the situation will continue beyond November 4. Today, the banking channels are open but after November 4 it will change. But whatever is decided by the country, we will follow that and we would be able to manage any situation. We already have tied up or firmed up with other countries, so I have options if Iran crude goes down...don’t ask me names,” Singh said.
Indian Oil buys about 7 million tonnes of crude from Iran a year on a term contract basis because it offers “very good terms and conditions for the crude supply”.
Iran crude, according to Singh, comes on very large crude carrier (VLCC) parcels.
While Indian Oil prefers transporting crude on Indian flag ships, there are many countries which supply cargo on foreign flag ships. “There is a lot of cargo coming on foreign flag ships also because Indian flag ships are not enough. So let us not restrict ourselves to Iran crude coming on Indian flag ships,” Singh said.
Indian Oil reckons that some 20 per cent of its profits would come from the petrochemicals business in the medium term, which formed the three main planks of a diversification plan that includes gas, exploration and production. The company expects about 10-15 per cent of its profits coming from the gas business and 10 per cent from the upstream segment."

Biofuel will not only reduce India’s import dependence but also help create a cleaner environment

Biofuel will not only reduce India’s import dependence but also help create a cleaner environment
   -  aydinmutlu


With consumers demanding cost-effective and fuel-efficient vehicles, and the government pushing for cleaner fuel as well as reducing import dependence, the onus is now on auto makers and oil refiners to offer such products.
In keeping with this demand, auto makers, including Maruti Suzuki India and refiners, including public sector giant Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), have joined forces to offer the best.
Tests are happening at various levels at the IndianOil Research & Development Centre and other places to work on various specifications of blending biofuel — ethanol blended petrol/diesel and engine configuration that could help save fuel and lead to better mileage.
While approving the National Policy on Biofuels. the government had observed that it would not only reduce import dependence but also help create a cleaner environment. Sources at Maruti Suzuki said that the company was not only working with IndianOil, but also with NITI Aayog and Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) for testing of the engines at various levels, and design.
CV Raman, Senior Executive Director (Engineering), Maruti Suzuki, told BusinessLine that “Methanol blended fuel is a very different fuel as compared to current fuel. In order to understand the impact of the fuel on engines and vehicles in terms of material, emission, efficiency and driving behaviour, a comprehensive check is required. Based on this, proper design changes can be implemented to make vehicles compliant. Maruti Suzuki is actively working with NITI Aayog for conducting this evaluation.”
Work is also happening on taking e10 (10 per cent blending) to e20 (20 per cent).
According to industry sources, ethanol-blended petrol costs may not be expensive because the current procurement price of ethanol in India is lower than the international price of petrol. 
Reduction of GST on ethanol in July from 18 per cent to 5 per cent has also helped ethanol-blending programme. In e10 and e20 blends of petrol, ethanol component will be higher and this will impact petrol price positively, oil refiners argue.
SSV Ramakumar, Director (R&D), IndianOil said, “Currently, for Maruti Suzuki, we are using different blends to further fine-tune the engine.""
He said that IndianOil R&D, Indian Institute of Petroleum at Dehradun and Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) conduct a joint study for such purposes. “There are extensive discussions among all stakeholders before formalising the specifications,” he said adding that “among various issues deliberated flexi-engines is one subject. It has to happen sometime, but it is for the car makers to decide.” Ramakumar also said that the draft of e20 specifications have been circulated among stakeholders and field evaluations are underway. 
It is based on the suggestions made and the draft formalised that BIS notifies them, he added.
According to industry experts, world over, industries are looking at alternatives to fossil fuels, including electric vehicles as the price of crude oil has been fluctuating in the world market and has increased significantly in the recent past. 
Such unforeseen escalations in crude oil prices are severely straining economies the world over, particularly those of the developing countries.
The National Policy on Biofuels has also noted that India’s energy security would remain vulnerable until alternative fuels to substitute/ supplement petro-based fuels are developed based on indigenously produced renewable feedstocks.
In biofuels, the country has a ray of hope in providing energy security. Biofuels are environment-friendly fuels and their utilisation would address global concerns about containment of carbon emissions. 
The transportation sector has been identified as a major polluting sector. Use of biofuels has therefore become compelling in view of the tightening automotive vehicle emission standards to curb air pollution, it noted.
Therefore, a company like Maruti Suzuki, which is also the largest car manufacturer in the country, has to look at such alternatives. The company has more than 50 variants of vehicles right now and needs to pull up its socks to offer alternative fuel options. It already has CNG-run vehicles and will be launching an electric car by 2020."

 Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL), the entity that plans to build the world’s plant in Maharashtra, will source 30 million tonnes (mt) or half of the crude it requires, from partners Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Saudi Aramco) and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), a top official said.
Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, and ADNOC, both state-owned, will together hold a 50 per cent stake in the ₹3-lakh crore project.
Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, which together hold the balance 50 per cent stake in the 60-mt-a-year project, will also have the right of first refusal on Saudi Aramco and ADNOC’s share of products coming out of the refinery if the two decide against retailing it in India on their own and sell to customers in India or overseas, the official at one of the state-run refiners, briefed on the plan, said asking not to be named because the information is private.
“We have a commitment that we will source a maximum of 50 per cent from these two parties, but all this is subject to the grade fitting into the overall refinery configuration. The advantage with Saudi Aramco is that they have Arab Super Light to Arab Heavy and they are willing to make available anything in this range depending on the refinery configuration we chose,” he said. 
“We are talking about importing 30 mt of crude from somebody; rest of the 30 mt is still open. This big 30 mt... every month if you try to buy 1-2 mt of crude... how it is going to happen?” 
“We will decide the ratio amongst ourselves. Only then can they consider selling the products to someone else locally or taking the products out of India. Basically, we are building this refinery for India and Indians. They probably want to give us their share of the products because their initial view is not to get into retailing of products in India, maybe petrochemicals because of SABIC (Saudi Basic Industries Corp). 
“They are trying to get SABIC into the fold so that markets like India and China can be an integrated market for them,” the official, who is a director at one of the oil marketing companies, said.
Saudi Aramco is separately looking to buy a controlling stake in SABIC, one of the world’s top petrochemicals manufacturers, owned by the Saudi Arabian government.
“No Middle East company is going to participate in refinery projects without having an engagement with crude. On the other hand, if you want to make big investments today you also need to have suppliers of crude who will give you a constant source of supply of the crude you want. 
“So, if you really look at it long-term for such project of large investments, nothing is going to happen unless we have the crude supply tied-up and the product market. You know the India story, we have a big product market,” he stated."

 Domestic oil refiners have drawn up contingency plans to meet the shortfall if crude oil supplies from Iran are slashed.
Speaking on the sidelines of the World Energy Policy Summit, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Chairman and Managing Director, Shashi Shanker, said, “There are contingency plans in place. We have some agreements with different countries.”
Shanker was responding to questions on the way ahead for ONGC’s refinery subsidiaries, HPCL and MRPL, once crude oil supplies from Iran are halted due to the US sanctions. The sanctions kick in from November 4.
“In every long term agreement, there is a minimum offtake quantity plus there is some flexibility. We can draw more from other suppliers because we are not dependent only on Iran,” Shankar explained.
Essentially, the refiners can opt for sourcing more crude oil from their other suppliers. The additional requirement can be met well within the existing terms of agreement.
Assuring that there will not be any shortfall, Director, Refineries at IndianOil, BV Rama Gopal said, “India’s energy demand will be met, with or without Iran.”
Gopal explained that the crude volumes are contracted annually. “The total crude quantity is finalised for the year. So if I lift now more, at the end of the year it has to be slashed,” Gopal said.
Effectively the refiner can buy more volumes of crude earlier during the year and meet the contractual requirements. Similarly, they may also buy lesser crude oil from another contract earlier during the year and then offset any shortfalls later during the year.
 According to data released by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS), India’s crude oil imports from Iran rose by 43.72 per cent to 2.07 million tonnes (mt) in August.
Cumulatively, India’s oil imports from Iran in the first five months (April to August) of this financial year rose 43.69 per cent to 13.32 mt against 9.26 mt imported during the same period a year ago.
But does this mean that crude oil supplies from Iran to India will be stopped completely?
Not so, according to Shanker. He said, “Based on the past experience I can say that cutting to zero is unlikely.” “What is going to happen from today regarding supplies from Iran is not clear. As of now, no significant steps are being taken. We are adopting a wait-and-watch approach,” Gopal added."

42,2018-10-08,IOC,"National interest prompted Re 1 roll-back: HPCL chief


Public sector oil marketing companies will continue to maintain a discount of Re 1 a litre on petrol and diesel, till being asked not to, by the Centre.
Speaking on the sidelines of the Energy Forum, Hindustan Petroleum Chairman, M K Surana, told BusinessLine, “The price cut has been effected as per the directives of the Finance Minister. It is in the national interest.”
Surana said there has been no official letter or communication from the Centre to regulate prices.
On Thursday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had asked PSU oil companies to cut the price of petrol and diesel by Re 1 each. This was in addition to an excise duty rollback of Re 1.50 a litre on both fuels.
Oil companies price auto fuels by benchmarking them to international prices, according to a formula.
Explaining the mechanism for the price lowering, Surana said, “Whatever be the price according to the formula, it will be lowered by a rupee till further notice from the Centre.”
Despite the Centre’s directive, the oil companies maintained that prices of auto fuels are deregulated. Oil company officials said the government in its capacity as the largest shareholder can direct the price lowering.
“The impact of the Re 1 hit on margins will be lowered from the revenues while reporting results,” Surana said.
Indian Oil Chairman, Sanjiv Singh said, “Petrol and diesel prices continue to be deregulated. The impact of the Re 1 per litre cut on revenue is expected to be Re 4,000- Re 5,000 crore for the next six months.”"
41,2018-10-14,IOC,"Oil marketing companies: Value in the pipeline
The stocks of the public sector oil-marketing companies (OMCs) — Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL — were hammered down 25-35 per cent in just two trading sessions on October 4 and 5. This sucker punch was the market’s strong show of disapproval to the Centre’s move to force these companies to take price cuts of ₹1 per litre on petrol and diesel as part of the price relief package for customers. 
On its part, the Centre cut excise duty on these fuels by ₹1.5 per litre, and the Finance Minister urged States to reduce sales/value-added tax (VAT) by ₹2.5 a litre to bring the total relief to ₹5 a litre. 
Rapidly rising global crude-oil prices, the rupee’s rout, and high excise duty and VAT, combined together, were propelling petrol and diesel prices to all-time highs on a daily basis. With customers getting increasing restive, the Centre, under pressure, finally cut excise duties after holding out for a long time. In the process, it also made the oil companies sacrifice.
While customers were somewhat relieved, the market voted with its feet at the forced co-option of the OMCs in the cost cuts. There is a strong fear that this move signals the end of fuel-price deregulation — the key reform that was instrumental in improving the fortunes of the OMCs over the past few years. Petrol pricing was decontrolled in 2010, and that of diesel in 2014. While the Finance Minister has stated that pricing of the fuels remains deregulated and that the OMCs could continue to adjust prices with market movements, the market seems unconvinced.
That’s because a pattern has emerged of the OMCs capitulating to the diktats of the government — their major shareholder — and losing their pricing freedom on petrol and diesel in the poll season — the companies go slow or temporarily freeze price hikes altogether. 
This happened during the run-up to the Gujarat elections last Decemberm and repeated itself prior to the Karnataka elections in May. As a result, the marketing margins of the OMCs took a sharp knock. But when the poll season was behind them, the oil firms made up the lost ground by hiking prices; marketing margins went up again.
The market has been worried whether this recoup-after-elections phenomenon will be possible in the coming months, with an intense election cycle on the cards. 
Elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Mizoram and Chhattisgarh are lined up for the end of the year and the Lok Sabha elections is likely to be held sometime in April. Even before the latest rout, the OMC stocks had been big losers — losing 30-50 per cent over a year.
The latest arm-twisting of the OMCs by the Centre only adds to the apprehensions of the market. There is continued uncertainty about the trajectory of both oil and the rupee, and the Centre’s financial position is tight. There are worries that in the event oil prices again rise sharply or the rupee’s rout continues, the OMCs will be again told to cut fuel prices. The stocks’ recent crash has more to do with seriously soured sentiments than the financial impact of the ₹1-per-litre cut. In all, after a strong run from 2013-end until last year, the OMC stocks have shed about 40-55 per cent or more over the past year or so. 
Valuations are also down sharply. The Indian Oil stock now trades at about fives times trailing 12-month earnings, compared with the three-year average of 10 times. Similarly, the stocks of HPCL and BPCL are trading at about four times and 5.5 times, much lower than their three-year averages of about 8.5 times and 12 times. The stocks seem to have been de-rated on the concerns about the lack of pricing freedom.
Does this sharp fall present a buying opportunity? Maybe, but only if you have a stomach for high risks and a long-term horizon. There is danger — in the short-term, at least — that the OMCs may again be made patsy to keep petrol and diesel prices under check. But on the other hand, there are certain factors that make for an investment case now.
One, heavy value-destruction in the OMC stocks harms their major shareholder — the Centre — too, and could sharply reduce the latter’s inflows in the future when it may seek to divest stakes in these companies. 
The Centre will hopefully take lessons from the recent carnage and become more creative in the future when it comes to price cuts. It could direct the OMCs — arguably, still in good financial health — to pay higher dividends, and cut excise duties from these proceeds, instead of asking the OMCs to cut prices on their own. If this were done, the monetary implications for the Centre will largely be the same, but the market sentiment for the OMC stocks could improve. 
Next, coming to dividends, the OMC stocks are likely to continue paying healthy dividends, come rain or shine. Over the past three fiscal years, the dividend per share has been ₹14-35. The combination of high dividends and stock price decline translates into high dividend yields. After the recent crash, the dividend yield is 7-8 per cent for these three stocks. 
Finally, despite the pulls and pressures, earnings growth has remained healthy for the OMCs, aided by expansions and inventory gains. While the price freezes and cuts will have some impact, earnings should continue growing at a good pace over the long run, with the companies expanding and upgrading their capacities. Besides, it is unlikely that the government will completely roll back the pricing reforms that had ushered in huge positive change over the past few years. It is likely that, in less than a year, when the election dust settles, true pricing freedom will be restored to the OMCs."

 Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have an ambitious plan to open nearly 4,500 fuel outlets across Gujarat, an official said on Saturday.
Talking to reporters here, Indian Oil Chief Regional Manager Sunil Vikramsingh said, “To meet the increasing requirements of customers on highways, agricultural sector products and industries, it was observed necessary to open such fuel outlets in the state.” 
“IOCL, BPCL and HPCL have an ambitious plan to open nearly 4,500 fuel outlets in the state,” he said. About 3 to 4 fuel outlets will be opened near the Statue of Unity, dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and the world’s tallest statue, at Kevadiya in neighbouring Narmada district, he added.
 More than three lakh visitors have already visited the site. Therefore, opening of three to four fuel outlets will help the tourists, the official said. The OMCs (oil marketing companies) plan to expand in tier II and III cities as well as rural areas, interior areas and remote areas as they lack presence in these geographies.
 The Indian Oil will set up 128 retail outlets, with Bharat Petroleum 50 and Hindustan Petroleum 49 in Vadodara district of Gujarat. “All these OMCs are set to expand their fuel retail network after a gap of nearly four years, which is due to eight per cent annual growth in sale of petrol and four per cent in diesel,” Vikramsingh said. The OMCs have formally announced their plans and bidding process for inviting tenders has also started, he said, adding that each fuel outlet will cost between Rs 60 lakh to Rs 3 crore depending on their location.
 “The OMCs for the first time have come together to work on such a scale to avoid duplication and eating into each other’s business,” he added. Retail outlets opened after 2014 were largely through the revival of old stations or restoration of dealerships that had been terminated because of non-performance since 2005. Under the new dealership guidelines, the educational qualification for a dealer has been lowered to Class X pass from the previous requirement of being a graduate and the upper age limit has been raised to 60 years from 45."

All the investors who are on the books of the company as on December 25, (record date) will be eligible for the buyback and interim dividend. These decisions were taken at the board meeting held here on Thursday.
According to a regulatory filing, “Buyback of equity shares of the company not exceeding 29,76,51,006 equity shares being approximately 3.06 per cent of the total paid-up equity share capital of the company at a price of ₹149 per equity share payable in cash for an aggregate consideration not exceeding ₹4,435 crore…” All equity shareholders of the company, as on the record date, will be allowed to tender shares on proportionate basis.
“The public announcement setting out the process, timelines and other requisite details will be released in due course in accordance with the buyback regulations,” the company said. The buyback price is at an 8.6 per cent premium to Thursday’s closing price of IOC’s stock on the BSE.
The IOC stock closed 0.5 per cent higher at ₹137.20 on the exchange. The government, which holds 54.06 per cent stake in the company, is expected to participate in the share buyback. Back-of-the-envelop calculation shows the government could get up to ₹2,400 crore through the buyback.
The government is targeting a minimum ₹5,000 crore through share buyback offers of various Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) such as Coal India, BHEL and Oil India. Besides IOC, at least half a dozen other central CPSUs have disclosed share buyback programmes. These include NHPC, BHEL, NALCO, NLC, Cochin Shipyard and KIOCL.
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which has a target of raising ₹80,000 crore for the government through stake-sale in CPSEs, had prodded all cash-rich PSUs to go for share buybacks. CPSUs having a net worth of at least ₹2,000 crore and cash balance of more than ₹1,000 crore have to mandatorily go in for share buybacks. Of the ₹80,000-crore disinvestment target, the government has so far raised just over ₹15,000 crore through minority stake-sale in PSUs.

Automating the loading system reduces time and manpower needed, says Shailesh Gupta
   -  THE HINDU


When Shailesh Gupta, Director of Faridabad-based HT Process Controls, manufacturer of LPG and bitumen filling equipment, embarked on an automation project for one of the customers — Indian oil Corporation (IOCL) — the company’s revenue shot up by seven times in the next three years.
 HT Process Controls, in collaboration with Wisconsin-headquartered Rockwell Automation and its Indian partners, has developed a solution for automating the process of filling and loading of LPG cylinders. 
“The robotic loading system is a gantry robot. Its function is to fill propane bottles and load them on to the trucks. Today, it is a manual job and its efficiency cannot be constant, given the hot summer season and the possibility of accidents,” Gupta said. 
“Automating the process helped to reduce loading time from 25 to 12 minutes and manpower from three people to zero,” he added. It also helped to reduce risk factors emerging from potential accidents in which both people and equipment can be harmed. 
After completing the two-year-long tests of first such robotic loading system at one of the filling plants of IOCL, HT Process Controls is staring at a ₹500-crore opportunity.
“We see a potential of installing 200-250 more such systems only at IOCL. There is scope for installing at least 800 such systems in the entire industry. It could be a ₹500-600 crore opportunity,” Gupta told BusinessLine.
While Indian machinery builders are benefiting from various government schemes, they can also leverage technology to advance their offering to large OEMs and end-customers.
“The cost of automation quoted by large foreign players is 30-50 per cent higher than what Indian companies can offer, “ Gupta said. 
 While Industry 4.0, which stands for using automation and data analysis in the manufacturing processes, may not be on top of the minds of Indian SMEs, industry players believe SMEs will be the driving force for automation in the country, as they are trying to compete with foreign majors.
“SMEs involved in building machinery for various industries are competing with a few large global companies from Western Europe, China, and are able to win businesses from large customers in India because they have the ability to respond quickly,” Dillip Sawhney, MD- India, Rockwell Automation India told BusinessLine."

Subsequent to the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) scheme, LPG penetration in Karnataka has increased from 68.49 per cent in June 2014 to 96.75 per cent in December 2018.
“The number of LPG customers stood at 95.83 lakh as on June 1, 2014. It stood at 143.20 lakh as on December 1, 2018, which is an increase of 47.87 lakh in the last four years. Under the PMUY, 18.03 lakh connections have been released in Karnataka up to November 2018. Of this, Indian Oil Corporation accounted for 8 lakh connections, Bharat Petroleum Corporation 4.58 lakh and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation 5.4 lakh,” said D. L. Pramodh, Executive Director, Indian Oil Corporation, and state-level co-ordinator for the oil industry in Karnataka.
According to Census 2011, Karnataka had 133.55 lakh households and as per decadal growth, the number of households would be 48.01 lakh currently. Of these, the number of active customers would be 143.2 lakh, accounting for 96.75 per cent LPG coverage in the state.
To expand LPG coverage further, the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan was launched during June to August 2018, wherein LPG Panachayats were conducted throughout the state.
“A total of 1,440 villages in Karnataka were identified as having low LPG penetration. We are targeting them by initially releasing 2 lakh connections to the eligible beneficiaries,” said Pramodh.
The Extended Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana-2 (EPMUY) scheme has been approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA). In this scheme, BPL households not covered under the SECC data and EPMUY would be facilitated to avail of the PMUY LPG connection. “This scheme will lead to near 100 per cent LPG penetration in Karnataka, by releasing LPG connections to the poor adult women in rural households,” explained Pramodh.

 Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has signed its first annual deal to buy United States (US) oil, paying about $1.5 billion for 60,000 barrels a day in the year to March 2020 to diversify its crude sources, its chairman said on Monday.
IOC is the first state refiner to buy US oil under an annual contract, in a deal that will also help boost trade between New Delhi and Washington.
The company has previously purchased US oil from spot markets and signed a mini-term deal in August to buy 6 million barrels of US oil between November and January.
IOC chairman Sanjiv Singh said the annual contract will begin from April. He declined to give the name of the seller or pricing details, citing confidentiality.
A trade source, who is not authorised to speak to media, said IOC has signed the deal with Norwegian oil company Equinor .
Equinor, which has set up an office in New Delhi to support oil marketing and trading, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Indian Oil buys about 75 per cent of its oil needs through long-term deals, mostly with OPEC nations.
The term deal will help cut IOC's dependence on Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) crude, said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of east of Suez oil for consultants FGE in Singapore.
“Lots of geopolitical issues are going around. We expect lots of volume going away from Venezuela, west Africa and Iran, so it makes sense to have guaranteed term supplies from the US, where crude production is increasing,” she said.
“There is a push for diversification everywhere. South Korea is giving a freight rebate for non-Middle East crude imports,” she added.
India and the US, which have developed close political and security ties, are also looking to develop bilateral trade, which stood at $126 billion in 2017 but is widely seen to be performing well below its potential.
The two countries have set up seven groups of chief executives with top US and Indian firms to boost bilateral trade in areas including energy.

To begin with, the terminal will meet the gas requirements of Manali area for customers such as Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Madras Fertilisers Ltd, Tamil Nadu Petroproducts and Manali Petrochemicals Ltd, said an IOC spokesperson.
In future, natural gas from the terminal will also be catering to the gas requirements of entire Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
The terminal will supply natural gas to various consumers with IndianOil by laying a 1,244-km pipeline for evacuation of natural gas. It will pass through Manali, Thiruvallur, Puducherry, Nagapattinam, Madurai, Tiruchi, Tuticorin, and Ramanathapuram, and a separate line to Bengaluru via Hosur.
The terminal has received all necessary clearances for commissioning. IndianOil has arranged LNG commissioning cargo from Swiss Trader, Gunvor. 
The first LNG cargo was delivered through LNG ship ‘Golar Snow’ from Qatar. The ship was berthed on February 26 at the LNG jetty for commissioning of the terminal.
The Ennore LNG terminal project and associated pipeline infrastructure projects cumulatively account for investments of about ₹9,000 crore, the spokesperson said.
The terminal is part of India’s plan to enhance the share of natural gas in the country’s energy basket from the present 6.2 per cent to 15 per cent by the year 2030.
Kamarajar Port Ltd chairman (holding additional charge) P Raveendran said KPL has allotted 128 acres of land and 362 m of water front to Indian Oil LNG — a special purpose vehicle. This is the largest single project investment in KPL, he added.
From the port side, the project consists of two sets of facilities — one in the marine side that includes jetty for berthing the LNG vessels and unloading facilities; and second is landside facilities of storage and re-gasification tank farms, which are the distribution points for the LNG through pipelines. Both the facilities are connected through pipelines. 
“Kamarajar is sure to emerge as the trendsetter for other ports in East Coast, “ he said.
By adding this facility, KPL achieves an installed capacity of 62 MT and with other on-going projects and in line with business plan, KPL aims to achieve 142 MT of capacity by the year 2025, Raveendran said.
Through a video link from Kancheepuram, Modi also laid the foundation stone for four-laning of NH-45C from Vikravandi to Thanjavur and the six-laning of Karaipettai to Walajapet section of NH-4. He also dedicated the electrification of Erode-Karur-Tiruchchirapalli and Salem-Karur-Dindigul railway lines."

 Indian refiners are increasing their planned purchases from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Mexico and the United States (US) to make up for any loss of Iranian oil, sources and company officials said.
All four Indian state-owned refiners that buy Iranian oil are confident of securing additional barrels from other producers, officials from the companies said.
The state refiners have not yet placed orders for Iranian oil for May, when the current waiver expires, pending clarity from the US.
Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) have tapped Iraq to make up for Iranian oil, while Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has signed its first annual contract with US suppliers and raised supplies from Mexico.
“There will be no supply constraints. The supply can come from both OPEC and non-OPEC nations like the US,” said MK Surana, chairman of Hindustan Petroleum Corp, which purchased up to 1.5 million tonnes per year of Iranian crude in 2018/19.
The OPEC and other producers including Russia have gradually tightened supply through 2019 to reduce a global glut. OPEC and its partners may not renew the curbs when they expire after June because of the risk of over-tightening the market.
IOC, Iran's biggest Indian client, will cut Iranian oil imports to six million tonnes, or about 120,000 barrels per day, in the 2019/20 period from nine million in 2018/19. It has also raised the optional volumes it can buy from other producers to two million tonnes, a company official said.
“Our optional quantities under term deals are higher than last year. We have optional contracts with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other suppliers. They will supply more if we want,” the official said, adding his firm would also buy more US oil if required.
IOC also hopes to buy 1.5 million tonnes of Mexican oil in 2019, compared with 1 million tonnes last year, the source said.
Officials from state-owned National Iranian Oil Co did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the Indian refiners' plans to purchase less Iranian crude.
Refinery officials said their 2019/20 crude import strategy was not contingent on Iranian oil, and was more flexible than in previous years.
“We don't have a watertight plan for the year, we have optional quantities so that it is possible to find replacement if any country goes out for any reason,” said an MRPL official.
During previous sanctions against Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq raised supplies to India to grow market share in the country, the world's third-biggest oil consumer and importer.
Last year, MRPL signed its first annual deal with Iraq to buy 1.5 million tonnes of Basra oil in 2019.
BPCL has signed a deal to buy 5 million tonnes of Iraqi oil in 2019 compared with 1.5 million tonnes in 2018, its head of refineries R Ramachandran said, adding his company is considering buying more oil from South America.
BPCL recently bought Brazilian crude and plans to buy Mexican oil as well, he said.
“We have a strategy with and without Iran,” he added."

The shares of Indian oil marketing companies on Monday skid after global crude prices rallied by about 3 per cent to levels last seen in Nov 2018.
Oil prices shot up after United States announced that all buyers of Iranian oil will have to end their imports shortly, or be subject to U.S. sanctions. Removing the sanctions exemptions would reduce oil supply from a market that is already tight because of U.S. sanctions against Iran and fellow OPEC-member Venezuela.

 Financial profiles of state-owned oil marketing companies such as Indian Oil Corp (IOC) may be at risk in the near to medium term due to pressure from the Central Government to increase shareholder returns, Fitch Ratings said on Friday.
Struggling to meet budget targets, the Government had in the recently concluded fiscal (2018-19) asked cash-rich public sector units (PSUs) to pay second interim dividend as well as undertake share buyback. The share buybacks, wherein a company re-purchases its shares and extinguishes them, helped the government get money while maintaining its control over them. 
“The oil marketing companies (OMCs) IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and upstream entity Oil India Ltd (OIL) declared high interim dividends of 67.5 per cent to 110 per cent of the face value of their shares, and undertook share buybacks in the financial year ended March 31, 2019 ,” Fitch said in a statement.
These, it said, were likely to have been driven by pressure from the Indian government to increase shareholder returns to shore up the weak fiscal position and finance promises made ahead of elections in April and May 2019.
“The higher shareholder returns will put more pressure on the financial profiles of the companies, which have large investment plans for the next two years,” Fitch said.
IOC and BPCL are in the process of upgrading and expanding their refineries to meet the deadline for producing ultra-clean Euro-VI grade fuel by April 2020, and improving downstream integration in petrochemicals. OIL plans to augment its domestic production and reserves.
In addition, BPCL and OIL are likely to invest in an upcoming Mozambique LNG project after a final investment decision on the project, which is expected in the second half of 2019, it said.
“OIL has limited headroom in its current standalone credit profile of ‘bbb-’, which may be revised down if weakening of its financial profile results in net leverage (adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR) exceeding 2.5x. However, in such an event, OIL will benefit from one notch of support from the state, resulting in the final rating remaining unchanged at ‘BBB-’,” the rating agency said.
In comparison, IOC and BPCL have more headroom in their ‘bb+’ standalone credit profiles and are likely to remain resilient even in case of any modest weakening in their financial profiles.
The OMCs additionally face the risk of government intervention in fuel prices during the elections.
“However, Fitch does not foresee any significant impact on OMCs’ financial profiles on account of fuel price controls. We expect the OMCs to make up the losses in the subsequent period during the year in such an event,” the statement said.
Fitch said it believes OMCs will continue to revise prices daily to reflect the market prices over the medium term.
The ratings on IOC and BPCL are equalised with that of the state, in line with Fitch’s Government Related Entities Rating Criteria."

Earlier this year, IOC had called for bids to hire a ten-year old oil super tanker for a firm period of five years with two extensions of one year each

   -  KSL


 Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC) has hired a foreign flagged very large crude carrier (VLCC) at a day rate of $31,950 for seven years. This has upsetting the calculations of the Government to use such long-term contracts to help India expand its shipping capacity to haul more oil cargoes for strategic reasons.
Earlier this year, IOC had called for bids to hire a ten-year old oil super tanker for a firm period of five years with two extensions of one year each. This was the first of such experiments brokered by the shipping and oil ministries.
The move followed intense lobbying by the local shipping groups which said that long-term contracts would facilitate funding at better rates to buy ships.
Local fleet owners participating in the tender were given a so-called ‘right of first refusal’ to match the rate and take the contract if the lowest quotation was offered by a foreign owner.
The VLCC had to be fit with scrubbers when it begins the seven-year contract from January 2020, to comply with a global rule framed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
The country imported 84 per cent of its crude requirements in the last fiscal year and more than 90 pe cent of that were hauled on foreign flagged vessels. This entailed a foreign exchange outflow of freight worth billions of dollars.
Panama-flagged ‘Bright Pioneer’, a VLCC owned by Japanese ship owner Nissen Kaiun Co Ltd, had quoted the lowest day rate of $31,950 on the tender. Indian ship owners including the state-run Shipping Corporation of India Ltd (SCI) that had participated in the tender, however, declined to avail the right of first refusal and match the rate offered by ‘Bright Pioneer’, which they said were “too low”.
But, this argument lacked merit going by the weekly market rates published by Clarksons - the world’s biggest shipbroker- on Saturday. A five-year time charter for a modern VLCC currently fetches $26,250 a day for its owner, while a three-year deal earns $30,000 a day. The day rate for a one-year time charter is $34,000, according to Clarksons.
The Shipping Corporation of India had let its VLCC named ‘Desh Ujaala’ to IOC for six months beginning May/June. They had done so with two optional extensions of three months each (technically one year) at a day rate of about $22,100 when the market rate is $34,000 a day.
The only Indian link to the seven-year deal is that ‘Bright Pioneer’ is commercially operated by Singapore-based Global United Shipping Company founded by Captain Rajesh Unni. Global United Shipping is backed by Japanese trading group Mitsui & Co.
“IOC signed off on the deal to hire ‘Bright Pioneer’ a few days ago,” a person briefed on the contract said. Global United Shipping confirmed the development. 
Of the seven VLCCs run by Indian ship owners, only one – Desh Vibhor – run by SCI is less than 10 years old but is deployed on another contract. As a result, local owners had to first buy a ten-year old VLCC from the second-hand market and fit it with scrubbers to qualify. “Globally, most yards are booked fully for installing scrubbers that were ordered more than a year ago. Thus, ordering a scrubber and getting a yard slot to fit them by January next year has become impossible”, an industry official said. 
From January 1, 2020, ships must use fuel oil on board with a sulphur content of not more than 0.5 per cent mass/mass (m/m), a steep cut from the current global sulphur cap of 3.5 per cent m/m. Ships can meet the requirement by using low-sulphur compliant fuel oil or continue to use high sulphur fuel oil by fitting exhaust gas cleaning systems or scrubbers."

Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) will be making investments of ₹ 2 lakh crore in the next five to seven years to ‘provide comprehensive energy solutions to diverse user groups.’
In the company’s 2018-19 annual report, IOCL Chairman Sanjiv Singh said that this investment will not be limited to refinery expansions, new technologies for clean fuels and enhanced outputs, and refinery petrochemicals integration. 
“IOCL is aggressively leveraging its R&D expertise to move into horizon technologies such as 2G and 3G ethanol, bio-fuels, coal gasification, H-CNG, Hydrogen fuel cells, battery technologies, etc. These technologies along with cleaner fuels and higher engine efficiencies can offer sustainable solutions to today’s energy challenges,” he said.
On the exploration front, Singh said the company “is targeting its own equity oil gas of 7 million tonne per annum (mtpa) from its upstream portfolio by the year 2023-24 up from 4.39 mtpa currently and is continuously on the lookout for acquisition of stakes both in E&P ( exploration and production ) companies as well as individual assets.”"
16,2019-08-28,IOC,"Indian Oil to build a 1 GW electric vehicle battery plant

State-run oil refiner Indian Oil Corporation Ltd will set up a 1 Giga Watt (GW) plant to make batteries used for running electric vehicles (EVs) in partnership with an overseas start-up using a non-lithium ion raw material that is locally available, Chairman Sanjiv Singh said on Wednesday.
The move fits well with the government’s strategy to facilitate the adoption of EVs in the country’s energy basket, and cut the fuel import bill. It also supports a key element of the EVs industry — batteries and their recharge.
“If we look at EVs today, we know that it is more efficient, less complex, very advanced and more economical, if you are looking at the car alone. If you club it with batteries and electricity, from where electricity is coming, how you will replace batteries — because battery has a very limited life, how you recycle batteries, then probably, if you also look at the impact on environment, there is a puzzle which is yet to be solved,” Singh said.
“The lithium-ion battery we see today is not the only answer, or is the best answer. For a country like India, we don’t have a single grain of lithium. So, if you are looking at EVs in a very big way, we have to look for something which is indigenously available. We have already tied-up with one company. We are working on a solution which can be manufactured 100 per cent indigenously,” Singh said without elaborating.
According to Indian Oil’s director for Research and Development Dr SS V Ram Kumar, the planned battery plant will use “chemistries which are India-centric, whose raw material is easily available in this country, whose recycling technology is extremely mature, and whose recycling industry is well established in this country.”
He said that it will use “transition group of elements”.
“Those elements are known since ages, the natural resources of that particular element in this country is abundantly available, unlike in the case of lithium. For lithium, you have to be depending on imports, and that too from China, because all lithium reserves today are under the possession of China,” Ram Kumar said.
Th battery plant will be set up through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) formed by IOC and the overseas entity. “We may rope in another interested player, it could be anybody who brings in some expertise and synergies to this venture,” he said.
The location of the plant is yet to be decided, he said. “It will be located at a place where land is available at a reasonable price, and all the statutory clearances are available quickly,” he noted.
“It will be a manufacturing facility of battery to the scale, meaning minimum 1 GW. It’s a GW scale facility to be built in phases beginning with 25 MW or 50 MW and ramped up. It is be commensurate with the demand that is going to pick up in the country for e-vehicles and e-mobility. We have signed the agreement with the overseas start-up entity and is waiting for government clearance which is around the corner,” he added.
Sanjiv Singh said that Indian Oil is venturing into energy storage and the batteries business was a “new and profitable business avenue for the company”. “We have a strategic intent to scale-up presence in e-mobility by equipping customer touch points with turbo-charging and battery swapping facilities for EVs and plug-in hybrids,” he said."

 Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the nation’s biggest oil firm, plans to raise Rs 3,000 crore in rupee borrowings this month to meet its general corporate financing needs, IOC Director (Finance) Sandeep Kumar Gupta said on Tuesday.
“We plan to raise through a rupee denominated bonds issue up to Rs 3,000 crore. A similar amount may be raised later in the financial year,” he said here. “The bond issue will be of Rs 1,000 crore with a greenshoe option of another Rs 2,000 crore,” he said and added that “we may retain or not retain over-subscription of up to Rs 2,000 crore.” 
The bond issue will be of 10 year tenure.
“IOC plans to use the money raised though the bond issue for general corporate financing,” he said, adding that the company had a borrowing of Rs 81,000 crore at the end of September quarter.
 The company is aggressively expanding refining and petrochemical capacity and laying infrastructure to meet rising energy demand in the country. “We had a planned capital spending of Rs 25,000 crore during current fiscal. Of this, about Rs 8,000 crore was spent till August-end and another Rs 1,500 crore would have been done in September,” he said expressing confidence of fully spending the planned capex by March 2020.
The company, which subsidises cooking gas LPG and PDS kerosene, is yet to receive Rs 9,700 crore from the government in unpaid subsidises. “The unpaid subsidises are coming down. They were Rs 19,000 crore at the beginning of the fiscal and have now come down to Rs 9,700 crore,” he said.
Gupta said, IOC has already announced plans to invest Rs 2 lakh crore in next 5-7 years to expand refining and petrochemical capacities in order to maintain leadership position.
The plan is to almost double its oil refining capacity to 150 million tonnes per annum, expand fuels and LPG retailing network, jack up petrochemical production capacity and produce more crude oil and gas.
The company currently is India’s largest oil refiner with a group refining capacity of 80.7 million tonnes per annum. It wants to maintain this leadership position by raising the refining capacity to 150 million tonnes through greenfield and brownfield expansions.
Simultaneously, it wants to raise petrochemical production capacity to 13 million tonnes from the current 3.15 million tonnes. It is expanding Panipat naphtha cracking capacity and plans to set up new chemical projects in Gujarat, Paradip and Panipat. Also, the company is looking at rapid expansion in natural gas retailing by investing Rs 10,000 crore over the next eight years."

Indian Oil Corporation Limited has reported a ₹563.42 crore net profit for the quarter ending September 30, 2019. This is over 82 per cent lower than the ₹3,246.93 crore net profit reported by the company in the corresponding period of the previous financial year.
“The variation is largely on account of inventory loss. There was an inventory loss of ₹1,807 crore in the second quarter of the financial year 2019-2020. In the corresponding period of 2018-2019, there was an inventory gain of ₹2,895 crore,” IndianOil Chairman, Sanjiv Singh said.
The lower profits is also due to subdued global gasoline prices, Singh added.
On a per-barrel basis, the Gross Refinery Margin (gain per barrel of crude oil processed) stood at $1.28 a barrel during the quarter under review. IndianOil had reported a GRM of $ 6.79 a barrel during the corresponding quarter of the preceding fiscal.
Core GRM (the gain per barrel of crude oil processed without the inventory loss or gain) stood at $3.99 per barrel in the quarter ending September 30, 2019. This stood at $ 5.88 a barrel in the quarter ending September 30, 2018.
Revenue from Operations during the quarter under review stood at ₹1,32,376 crore compared to ₹1,51,567 crore in the corresponding quarter of the financial year 2018-2019.
Commenting on the aim to roll-out cleaner Bharat Stage VI grade auto fuel from April 1, 2020, Singh said, “We may meet the target of a nationwide roll out of BS VI grade fuel even before April 1. We have already started supplying BS VI grade fuel in Delhi-National Capital Region, which has commands around 10 per cent of the nationwide consumption.”
Taking a jibe at auto manufacturers that have been crying foul about the strict deadlines for roll-out of vehicles with better emissions, Singh said, “We have been supplying Delhi-NCT with BS-VI grade fuels for over a year now, how many BS-VI compliant cars do you see on the road?”"

Indian Oil has emerged as the first company to deliver the parcel of 0.5 per cent sulphur380 CST marine fuel oil to international ship.
The company has thus complied with International Maritime Organisation guidelines which require all the seagoing tanker vessel to switch over to marine fuel having a sulphur content of 0.5 per cent from January 1, 2020, against the current limit of 3.5 per cent. 
The company in a statement issued here said that the first bunker sales of this very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO ) in India were made during this week from Kochi and Kandla. In Kochi, supplies were made to the international tanker MV UACC Ras Tanura sailing to South Africa.
Indian Oil is also planning bunker fuel deliveries at the ports of Mumbai, Mangaluru, Tuticorin, Chennai, Visakhapatnam, Paradip and Haldia by mid-November.
VLSFO with 0.5 per cent is produced from sweet crude oil grades and complies with ISO 8217:2017 RMG380 standard.
As part of the company’s commitment to safeguard the environment and to reduce pollution, Indian Oil had become the first company to implement the guidelines by starting deliveries ahead of the mandated schedule."

Indian Oil Corporation has developed winter-grade diesel for Ladakh to address the problem of loss of fluidity in fuel during extreme winter conditions.
This product has been developed by IOCL’s Panipat Refinery. A company statement said, “Using the normal grade of diesel fuel becomes an arduous task for the people in the winter months where temperatures fall to sub zero temperatures of nearly –30 degree Celsius.”
“However, the winter grade diesel produced by Panipat Refinery for the first time has a pour point of – 33oC and does not lose its fluidity function even in the extreme winter weather of the region unlike the normal grade of diesel which becomes exceedingly difficult to utilise,” the statement said.
“This winter grade diesel also meets BIS specification of BS-VI grade diesel and has been successfully produced and certified for the first time by Panipat Refinery on November 8, 2019,” the statement added. 
The first Tank truck containing winter grade diesel has been flagged off from the Panipat Marketing Complex of IndianOil. Subsequent supplies of winter grade diesel would be done from the Jalandhar POL Terminal from where this fuel grade would reach the Leh and Kargil Depot to meet demands of customers of Leh-Ladakh region during peak winters."
5,2019-11-17,IOC,"State-run oil companies take a knock
Weak refining margins, subdued volumes and inventory losses took a toll on the performance of the three public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) — Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL — in the recent September 2019 quarter.
Indian Oil’s consolidated profit in the quarter fell nearly 86 per cent y-o-y to ₹468 crore, while that of HPCL fell about 22 per cent y-o-y to ₹762 crore. BPCL did better than its peers with about a 3 per cent rise in profit to ₹1,503 crore, but this too was nothing to write home about. But for a tax-reversal of about ₹580 crore, BPCL’s bottom-line, too, would have shrunk.
The major drag on the companies’ performance was a sharp fall in their gross refining margin (GRM) — the difference between the price of their product slate and the cost of crude oil.
Indian Oil’s reported GRM in the September 2019 quarter fell the most to $1.3 a barrel from $6.8 in the year-ago period.
BPCL’s reported GRM fell to $3.4 a barrel from $5.6, and that of HPCL fell to $2.8 a barrel from $4.8 in the year-ago period.
 
While inventory losses due to dip in fuel prices aggravated the impact on reported GRMs, especially for Indian Oil, the core GRMs, too, were weak during the quarter, except for BPCL which saw some rise.
Weak domestic economic conditions and resultant subdued volumes, especially the contraction in diesel sales, adversely impacted the financial performance and margins of the OMCs. Also, a planned shutdown at HPCL to upgrade to BS-VI fuels did not help.
Indian Oil’s sales revenue fell about 16 per cent y-o-y in the September 2019 quarter, while that of HPCL and BPCL fell 10-11 per cent y-o-y.
Marketing margins for the three companies improved in the quarter compared with the year-ago period, but this could not make up for the other challenges.
Interestingly, all the three companies have chosen, for now, to continue with the earlier tax regime. They have not shifted to the recently announced lower corporate tax rate regime that would have entailed giving up some tax incentives, including lapse of the accumulated MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax) credit.
The weakness in gross refining margin in the September 2019 quarter is a continuation of what was seen in the June 2019 quarter. So, for the six months from April to September 2019, Indian Oil’s GRM crashed to $2.96 a barrel from $8.45 in the year-ago period. BPCL’s GRM for the six months ended September 2019 more than halved to $3.10 a barrel from $6.52 in the year-ago period, and HPCL’s GRM, too, fell sharply to $1.87 from $5.93.
The environment in the refining market remains weak and so does the demand conditions, given the growth challenges in the economy. This could reflect in the financial performance of the OMCs in the coming quarters, too.
On the positive side, the International Maritime Organization’s regulations that mandate cleaner fuels for ships come into effect in January 2020. This should translate into an increase in demand for the higher-grade products of the OMCs and support their GRMs.
The weak financial performance of the OMCs has also reflected in their stock performance. Since early June, the Indian Oil and HPCL stocks have fallen about 22 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.
The BPCL stock was also on the back foot until a couple of months ago when news about the impending stake sale by the Centre in the company saw the stock taking off; it is now up about 20 per cent since early June."

The centre has initiated development projects worth ₹50,000 crore in the Union Territory of Ladakh, according to Home Minister Amit Shah.
Speaking at an event to mark the launch of special winter-grade diesel for Ladakh, Shah said that the Government of India has initiated a number of development projects for Ladakh in power, including solar energy, education and tourism, at an estimated investment of ₹50,000 crore. 
He said that keeping in view the special development requirement of the region, the Centre has made a provision that the budget allocation for Ladakh will remain non-lapsable, so as to enable the local administration to make full use of these funds as per their development needs.
Shah was presiding over a function to launch a special winter-grade diesel, developed by Indian Oil Corporation (IndianOil), for the high-altitude regions of Ladakh through a video link. Motorists in high-altitude sectors such as Ladakh, Kargil, Kaza and Keylong face the problem of fuel freezing when winter temperatures drop to as low as -30 degrees Celsius. 
IndianOil has come up with an innovative solution to this problem by introducing a special winter-grade diesel with a low pour-point of -33 degrees Celsius, which does not freeze even in extreme winter conditions, an official statement said."

Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IndianOil) may emerge as one of the contenders for Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) once the Centre initiates its disinvestment process.
The Centre recently announced plans to divest Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd’s (BPCL) 61.65 per cent shareholding in NRL, along with the transfer of management control, to a Central public sector enterprise operating in the oil and gas sector.
Asked if IndianOil will look at NRL as an asset, IndianOil Chairman Sanjiv Singh told BusinessLine: “Let us see how it comes (the offer). The process is all the same, whichever company pitches in.”
On further prodding, he said: “No, we are not ruling out anything.” He, however, hinted that competition could come from Oil India Ltd, one of the key PSUs in the oil exploration business, which has high stakes in the North-East."
2,2019-12-16,IOC,"IndianOil underlines safety of LPG terminal at Puthuvypeen 
 With construction work on the LPG import terminal restarting at Puthuvypeen near Kochi, IndianOil is confident about the safety of the project, saying that the terminal has adopted global standards of safety.
A company statement said that one-third of the cost is being spent on the safety features of the terminal. A risk analysis study conducted by PDIL (Projects & Development India Ltd-a PSU) also established that the terminal is extremely safe. Environmental Impact Assessment Study by PDIL has confirmed that the project would have no adverse impact on water, noise, air, environment and marine life.
Annually around 75,000 bulk LPG bullet truck movements take place across the congested Kerala roads to and from Mangaluru. This is highly risky and during the last five years more than 60 road accidents due to LPG Bullet Trucks have have been reported in Kerala.
Hence, the company wants to construct LPG cross-country pipelines so that road transportation of bulk LPG can be completely eliminated. Puthuvypeen LPG Import Terminal is essential for this so that LPG could be brought by sea to Kochi and further transported to various bottling plants by pipeline.
The joint venture of IndianOil, Kochi Salem Pipeline Pvt Ltd (KSPPL) is already in the process of laying pipelines in the State and it is expected to completely shift LPG bulk movement to pipelines, once the import is completed. 
The need for the project from a national and State perspective is high and moreover this national infrastructure project is aimed at meeting the daily requirements of cooking gas to the households of Kerala and other States. In Kerala, the LPG consumption was 1,050 TMTs in 2018-19. This is expected to touch 1,500 TMT by 2022 and 2,300 TMT by 2028.
Even after the ongoing BPCL-KR expansion is completed, LPG has to be brought from outside the State to meet the steeply growing demand. Puthuvypeen is the only safest infrastructure to ensure that this target is met and to reduce the current LPG refill waiting period, the statement added."

Indian Oil Corporation Limited’s (IOCL’s) INDMAX refining technology has been licensed to Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS) of Serbia for production of higher value products.
Lummus Technology Inc, USA, is the global licensing partner for IOCL’s INDMAX technology.
An IndianOil statement said that this is the first ever overseas agreement to licence IndianOil's INDMAX refinery process technology for high propylene production. 
An agreement for the same has been signed between NIS and Lummus, an IOCL statement said.
NIS is one of the largest vertically integrated oil & gas companies in Southeast Europe, with the Russian oil and gas conglomerate, Gazprom Neft (GPN), as its major shareholder.
IndianOil’s R&D Centre developed INDMAX in-house to enhance refinery profit margins by achieving high yields of LPG, light olefins and high-octane gasoline from residual petroleum hydrocarbon streams and fractions.
The efficacy of the technology was first demonstrated by setting up a 1 lakh tonnes per annum unit at IndianOil’s Guwahati Refinery in the year 2003. This was followed by the mega INDMAX unit at Paradip Refinery in 2015, which placed IndianOil in the league of world-class refinery process licensors. A third INDMAX unit of 0.74 million tonnes per annum is under commissioning at IndianOil’s Bongaigaon Refinery, the statement added."

 In a quest to unite the Indian skies, IndianOil has commissioned its 119th Aviation Fuel Station (AFS) at Agatti Island in Lakshadweep. The inaugural refuelling was done for an Alliance Air flight operating between Kochi and Agatti.
Agatti AFS is expected to cater to the aviation fuel needs of Indian Navy, Pawan Hans, Coast Guard, Alliance Air and other chartered flights.
Agatti is a scenic island that is just 7.6 km long situated on a coral atoll (called Agatti atoll). In the remote Lakshdweep islands off Kochi, Agatti is the only island with a runway strip and thus the only aerodrome in the vicinity.
Initially, the IndianOil Agatti AFS expects to service around 2-3 flights daily. The availability of jet fuel in Agatti, Lakshdweep is expected to boost tourism to the hitherto unexplored region of the country.
IndianOil Aviation Service is a leading aviation fuel solution provider in India and the most-preferred supplier of jet fuel to major international and domestic airlines. Between one sunrise and the next, IndianOil Aviation Service refuels over 2000 flights that is more than one aircraft per minute, from the bustling metros to the remote airports linking the vast Indian landscape, from the icy heights of Leh (the highest airport in the world at 10,682 ft) to the distant islands of Andaman & Nicobar.
IndianOil Aviation also caters to the fuel requirements of the Indian Defence Services, besides refuelling VVIP flights at all the airports and remote heli-pads/heli-bases across the Indian subcontinent. IndianOil is the only oil company in India to market the widest possible range of fuels used by the aviation industry in India- JP-5, Avgas 100LL, Methanol Water Mixture, Jet A-1 and aviation lubricants, etc."
