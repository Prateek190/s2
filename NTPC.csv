30,2019-05-04,NTPC,"NTPC: High on power
India’s largest coal-based power producer — NTPC — is one of the few power companies that will add new thermal capacity over the next three years. Given its robust position in the power segment, stable plant load factor (PLF) and attractive valuation, investors with a two to three-year horizon can buy the company’s shares. It also has a near-monopoly in thermal power production and is the largest power utility company in India. It delivers solid dividend yield to investors consistently, which makes it an attractive proposition.
NTPC’s coal-fired power plants had the highest PLF in the industry of 77.70 per cent for the quarter ended December 2018, according to data from Central Energy Authority.
The company’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple or PE ratio of 12.41 times is in line with its three-year average. The price-to-book value ratio of 1.27 is still inexpensive. Though not strictly comparable, JSW Energy trades at triple-digit trailing price-earning multiples.
The stock corrected over 25 per cent from its peak last year, before rallying smartly once again over the past few months to its current price level of ₹134.
It is a relatively stable and a somewhat defensive bet. NTPC pays dividend consistently and yields were above 4 per cent over the past few years, making it an attractive bet for medium-risk investors.
As India’s leading power producer, NTPC is poised to benefit from the increase in demand for electricity. The peak power demand in FY19 stood at 177 GW (1GW=1,000 MW) and is expected to reach 225.75 GW by the end of FY22. NTPC is one of the few power producers investing in new thermal capacity and has coal linkages for most of its power plants; any shortage of coal from Coal India Ltd will be made up through imports. For the quarter ended December 31 2018, domestic coal (from Coal India and captive mines) made up nearly 99.6 per cent of its total fuel intake. NTPC’s regulated cost-plus and return-on-equity model provides enough predictability to cash flows. The company can charge a rate of return over and above its cost and is assured a fixed ROE from its plants, provided it achieves a certain PAF (plat availability factor).
The new Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s norms for 2019-2024 maintained a base case return on equity (ROE) at 15.5 per cent, but capped the equity to be considered for ROE calculation for plants above 25 years old at 30 per cent, which is lower than expected. The plant availability factor (PAF) threshold — the amount of time the power plant is available to generate electricity — is 83 per cent under the norms. Maintenance shut-downs will not be taken into consideration to calculate the PAF.
This will help cushion base PAF. Fixing a standard loss of 85 Kcal/kg on coal when received by thermal power producers, will reduce raw material cost, thus boosting the ROE. However, splitting fixed cost recovery into peak and off-peak periods, along with stringent working capital norms, evens out any gains that would have accrued. The new norms are balanced for NTPC.
India’s move towards cleaner power production will not have much impact on NTPC. The company has most of its upcoming commercial capacity addition linked with long-term power purchase agreements with state discoms (distribution companies). As of December 31, 2018, the NTPC Group had total installed power capacity of 53,166 MW, of which commercially available capacity is 51,706 MW. NTPC has a pipeline of 30,000 MW of thermal power projects, which will go on stream over the new few years.
NTPC recently bid and won an 85 MW solar project from Uttar Pradesh. By 2032, it plans to have 32,000 MW of renewable energy capacity.
Delays in clearing bills by discoms have weighed on most power producers, and NTPC is no different. The company is working with State Governments to make sure its dues are cleared. Andhra Pradesh undertook a bond issue in February to clear some of its overdue power bills.
On overdues above 60 days, NTPC will earn a penalty from discoms of 1.5 per cent a month. As of March 2019, overdues above 60 days amounted to ₹5,985 crore out of a total of ₹10,260 crore, according to the Centre’s Praapti portal.
Maintaining the PAF above 83 per cent will allow NTPC to recover fixed costs through tariff; else, it will lead to under-recoveries. It works in two ways; the power plant is either not available for production due to maintenance, repairs or there isn’t enough fuel available to ensure the PAF above the prescribed threshold. NTPC expects the under-recovery in FY19 to be around ₹750 crore, nearly half the ₹1,400 crore figure in FY18. It has also made efforts to tie-up fuel for its power plants.
NTPC reported a net profit of nearly ₹7,400 crore for the nine months ended December 31 2018, down 0.2 per cent compared with the same period in FY18. Revenues were ₹69,085 crore, up 14.5 per cent. Under-recovery in Q3FY19 dragged the company’s profitability down a little; this is expected to reduce from Q4FY19 onwards. As of September 30 2018, NTPC had a cash balance of around ₹4,359 crore.
The company has a reasonably low debt-to-equity ratio of 1.15, while long-term debt to equity ratio is 1.04 as of March 31 2018."

Solar and wind power industries have been demanding setting up such a dispute resolution mechanism


 The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has decided to set up a three-member dispute resolution committee (DRC) to look into disputes beyond contractual agreements between solar or wind power developers and Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) or state-run power giant NTPC.
This mechanism will cover all those projects that would be implemented through or by SECI and NTPC.
Solar and wind power industries have been demanding such a dispute resolution mechanism.
 “It is felt that there is need to erect a transparent, unbiased dispute resolution mechanism, consisting of an independent, transparent and unbiased DRC), for resolving the unforeseen disputes that may arise in implementation of contractual agreements and also for dealing with issues which are beyond the scope of contractual agreements between solar power developers/ wind power developers and SECI / NTPC,” an MNRE office order said.
According to the order, a three-member DRC will be set up with the approval of the new and renewable energy minister, consisting of eminent persons of impeccable integrity. The upper age for the DRC members shall be 70 years, and its members shall be chosen from the eminent persons located in Delhi-NCR to avoid expenditure on air travel and accommodation.
 The selection of the DRC members would be such that there is no conflict of interest involved. The mechanism of DRC will be applicable for all solar or wind schemes, programmes and projects being implemented through or by SECI and NTPC.
 The DRC will consider cases including appeal against decisions given by SECI on extension of time requests based on terms of contract and all requests of extension of time not covered under the terms of contract.
 It will examine all such cases referred to it, including the cases where the developer is not satisfied with the decision of SECI or NTPC and it decides to appeal after paying the required fee. The order said the recommendations of the DRC, along with the MNRE’s observations, will be placed before the new and renewable energy minister for final decision.
To arrive at any decision, the Committee will be free to interact with the relevant parties of the case and shall record their views. No lawyer shall be permitted to present the case before the DRC, it added."

22,2019-07-28,NTPC,"Discoms make a beeline for cheaper power supplied by NTPC under SCED system 
 A large number of discoms are making a beeline for the power supplied by NTPC under the SCED system which facilitates supply of cheaper electricity on priority, industry sources said.
 Under SCED (Security Constrained Economic Dispatch), implemented over a year ago, power generating companies raise capacity utilisation of more efficient plants or of those units which are located closer to coal mines and thus have lower freight cost. 
 As a result, the cost of power production goes down, which benefits both the distribution companies (discoms) and end consumers.
 The mechanism then pools supply from selected stations on a national-level ‘merit order’, under which power is first dispatched from lower fuel cost units whenever any state seeks electricity from the central pool.
“A large number of discoms are availing benefit under the SCED system to get cheaper power supplies,” a source said.
“Power purchase cost of cash strapped power distribution companies has started to come down under the new SCED programme,” the source added.
 According to an estimate, discoms are expected to save as much as Rs 2.5 crore per day due to this mechanism that allows states to access cheaper power first.
 There are currently 49 thermal power plants as part of the SCED pilot project with a total installed capacity of 56 GW.
All stations of NTPC are contributing to the central pool. This optimisation scheme has a cost saving potential of around Rs 3,000 crore per year if all coal stations of the IPPs (independent power producers) and state generation companies are brought under its ambit.
 The arrangement where POSOCO (Power System Operation Corporation) has been given the flexibility to reschedule power from lower fuel cost units first means that even after adding transmission charges, the final tariff is still lower than most of the contracts signed by these entities.
 NTPC is best equipped to offer power at lower cost to the central pool since a number of its units have lower fuel costs and have been operational for decades now, which translates into lower fixed cost as well, another source said.
 The gross power generation of the the NTPC Group for 2018-19 was 305.90 billion units (BUs) as against 294.27 BUs during the previous year. The average power tariff of the firm was Rs 3.38 per unit in 2018-19."
21,2019-09-01,NTPC,"NTPC: Generating power 
NTPC’s shares have been volatile since the announcement of the June quarter results. The broader market volatility also played its part, but some element of pessimism seems to have crept in after the results came in.
There were many one-off items that depressed the company’s profits. This left the street wondering whether there is more pain in store.
But a pipeline of projects that will come on stream over the course of 2019-20 and till 2021-22 (nearly 15 GW) makes its current valuation look attractive. The stock trades at eight times its trailing 12-month earnings as against its historical three-year average of 12 times.
NTPC’s possible acquisition of the government’s stake in SJVN and NHPC has also weighed heavily on the stock.
The fear among investors seems to be that if NTPC buys NHPC or SJVN to fund the government’s disinvestment targets, it could curtail its dividend. NTPC is currently a high dividend- paying PSU (dividend yield of 4-5 per cent).
 








 
 
While these are concerns, the pessimism may be slightly overdone. The pipeline of projects, offering good revenue visibility, lends comfort to earnings over the next three years.
The net profit in the June quarter at the standalone level was flat at ₹2,603 crore. Revenue from operations grew just 7 per cent to ₹24,193 crore.
At the consolidated level, profit after tax (PAT) was ₹2,840 crore. The standalone profit for the quarter was impacted by a one-time impact of an additional charge under the old deviation- settlement mechanism that occurred in the June quarter.
This had a ₹150- crore impact on the June quarter’s profits. However, since the regulator has exempted power producers from paying this charge henceforth, there will not be any impact in the ensuing quarters.
Additionally, there was a ₹150- crore one-time impact due to use of older inventory of coal at some power plants in the Vindhyachal belt (Uttar Pradesh), which had a low gross calorific value (GCV). This meant the loss of GCV was higher than that permitted by the power regulator’s norms.
Hence, NTPC’s tariffs charged to power distributors were depressed to that extent. This is not expected to recur in the subsequent quarters as the company has fresh coal stocks available.








 
 
Contribution to earnings from NTPC’s subsidiaries and joint ventures is also likely to go up as more projects near commercial operations. The company has also set up a coal subsidiary to undertake all its coal mining activities and sell surplus coal to third-parties.
While concerns over NTPC acquiring the government’s stake in SJVN and NHPC have also weighed on the stock, the management has clarified that discussions with the Centre on an SJVN stake buy had taken place two years ago.
Also, there has been no talk so far of NTPC buying stake in NHPC.
NTPC is still interested in buying SJVN because it would help boost its non-fossil fuel-based power-generation portfolio, and not particularly on account of the government’s insistence alone.
The company has plans of non-fossil fuel-based power to contribute nearly 30 per cent of its 130 GW planned installed capacity by 2032.
There was some apprehension that a strike at one of Coal India’s subsidiaries would hamper power production at three plants, but NTPC says it has signed a long-term fuel supply arrangement with Coal India for an annual contracted quantity of 172 million tonnes per annum. The company’s plan to add nearly 5 GW of installed capacity every financial year till 2021-22 will automatically give a boost to its profits.
This comes at the back of muted commercial capacity addition in 2018-19.
The equity that is currently tied up in the capital work-in-progress or projects under construction will be freed and start earning returns for the company.
At the end of March 2019, the regulated equity base (REB) in projects commissioned stood at ₹53,989 crore; the management expects this to cross ₹ 60,000 crore by the end of 2019-20.
By the end of 2021-22, REB is expected to touch nearly ₹ 86,000 crore.
As more projects are commissioned, the investments made by NTPC in them will start earning returns and add to the cash balance."
19,2019-09-25,NTPC,"NTPC executives to take a call on strike after Navratri: NEFI Chairman
 
The NTPC Executive Federation of India (NEFI) is worried about Modi Government’s proposed plans to dilute the equity in NTPC Ltd below 51 per cent. In a protest against this, 13,000 executives of NEFI could go on a strike after October 7, said NEFI Chairman V K Sharma.
In a telephonic interaction with BusinessLine, Sharma said the strike will affect all the standalone power and joint venture power plants of the company. A call for the strike would be taken by the national council body of NEFI after Navratri celebration, he said.
Sharma also pointed out that the NTPC top management is keeping a studied silence over the matter but NEFI has learnt that the Power Ministry is considering the equity dilution plan.
Navratri celebration ends on October 7 and Dussehra on October 8, power plant shut down would mar the Diwali celebration across the country as NTPC is the largest power in the country.
An NTPC officer told BusinessLine on condition of anonymity that the equity dilution will lead to easy hire and fire policy, it will put a cap on the medical benefits and will negatively affect the company.
NTPC has an installed capacity of 55,786 MW (including 7,801 MW through JVs/Subsidiaries) comprising of 53 NTPC power plants. The company has 22 coal-based plants, seven combined cycle gas and liquid fuel based stations, two Hydro based and one wind-based power plant. It has ten JV stations and 11 other renewable energy projects.
Sharma in a letter addressed to Prime Minister Modi said that “Considering above, NTPC executives are seriously worried about the future of the company in the present context of proposed privatisation/disinvestment/stake sell, which they have built over 44 years with their untiring efforts.”
“Being chief of the nation, it is our earnest submission to your good self to kindly look into the matter and while taking into consideration the strategic importance of core sector CPSEs like NTPC Ltd, we would humbly request your good self to kindly review and shelve Government's plan regarding further disinvestment of government's stake in NTPC Ltd in the larger interest of the country…,” Sharma said.
In an earlier email (August 23) with BusinessLine, the NTPC management had said that the CMD, Gurdeep Singh had met some executives at the Darlipalli power project in Orissa, after media reports had mentioned about the dilution.
It was clarified to them that at present NTPC has no official communication on this issue from the government and employees should not be apprehensive on some unverified media reports."

CMP: ₹117.35

NTPC’s plant availability factor (PAF) was impacted at few stations in Q2FY20 due to coal supply issues emanating from heavy monsoon and strikes at Coal India (CIL) mines. Its average PAF fell to 85.4 per cent in Q2FY20 from 91.4 per cent in Q1FY20 and 85.5 per cent in Q2FY19.
The PAF decline was attributed to the prolonged strike at Talcher mine and four days of all India strike by CIL workers to protest against 100 per cent FDI in coal mining. Heavy monsoon in eastern parts of the country also affected coal production and supply.
 Under-recovery in Q2FY20 is expected to be ₹320 crore versus ₹110 crore in Q1FY20 and ₹270 crore in Q2FY19. We now believe that NTPC will face an under-recovery of ₹400-500 crore in FY20E. Factoring in this, we prune our FY20/21E EPS by 4 per cent/3.6 per cent.

The power purchase agreement that Andhra Pradesh entered into with NTPC Kudgi Thermal power plant, during the N Chandrababu government, was at exorbitant rates, alleged Andhra Pradesh Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy.
Addressing media, Reddy alleged the PPA was signed at ₹11.68 per unit when solar wind power was available at ₹4.80 per unit causing a huge loss to public exchequer. 
Seeking to highlight “irregularities,” the Minister said 392 million units (MU) were purchased during 2019 at inflated rates and ₹317 crore was the fixed cost paid irrespective of the quantum of power the State purchased. 
The Minister said, “The State government, on September 23, 2010, signed a PPA with NTPC Kudgi. After the bifurcation, 360 MW of power was allotted to Andhra Pradesh. The State government has lost ₹562.4 crore due to this PPA. Due to this, ₹274 crore was wasted as fixed cost and ₹288.4 crore towards additional power purchase cost, he said. As per the PPAs made by the Naidu government, with solar and wind power plants, the government has reduced the power purchase from NTPC Kudgi, where the cost of a unit is ₹3.58. 
And it has started to purchase solar and wind power at ₹4.84 per unit. 
The Minister clarified that the present government’s decision to purchase power at lower cost has brought down the costs.
The Minister said the previous government, on October 1, 2018, purchased 9.92 MU of power at ₹5.99 per unit. However, on October 1, 2019, under the present regime, 23.1 million units of power was purchased at ₹3.33 units and saved ₹2.66 on every unit compared to the previous year.
He said the State’s decision to review the PPAs has saved public money as energy was purchased at lower price when compared to the previous year.
Sharing details of the power purchase made in the recent days, he said the power purchase cost was lower than that purchased during the previous regime."

The Power business of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has operationalised two thermal power units of 660 MW each at NTPC’s Khargone Super Thermal Power project in Madhya Pradesh and Tanda Thermal Power Station in Uttar Pradesh.
The 660 MW Khargone unit is the country’s first ultra-supercritical unit set up on complete engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) basis. Ultra-supercritical units feature steam parameters of 600-degree Celsius and 270 kg/cm2 pressure resulting in higher efficiencies, enabling plants to consume less coal, resulting in lesser emissions in comparison to sub-critical and supercritical power plants.
SN Subrahmanyan, CEO & Managing Director - L&T, said: “Successful completion of full load trial run of India’s first ultra-supercritical power plant unit showcases our robust capabilities in engineering, manufacturing, project management and construction in executing complex mega power projects.”
Further, this has enabled NTPC to add 1320 MW capacity to the national grid and has also demonstrated L&T’s capabilities in executing complex power projects in India, the company said.
Earlier, L&T executed supercritical power projects for Nabha Power Ltd in Punjab, Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd and Madhya Pradesh Power Generation Company Ltd on complete EPC basis.

""If the Modi Government reduces the equity in the NTPC below 51 per cent, then the company  officers association along with workers unions will go on a strike by mid December affecting 40,000 MW of power production per day,"" said Chairman of NTPC Executive Federation of India (NEFI), VK Sharma.
NEFI is the officers association in the power sector behemoth.
According to the numbers shared on the Central Electricity Authority website, India’s total installed capacity in October is 3.63 lakh MW. This means that if the strike observed for a day it will impact over 10 per cent power production in the country.
Sharma in an interaction with BusinessLine said that first a token strike would observed and if the Modi Government persist with its equity dilution plans then the strike would be indefinite. The strike will coincide with Winter session of the parliament, which is expected to commence on November 18. The Centre currently holds about 54 per cent equity in the company.
Sharma said that the NEFI was in talks with unions and officers association in other PSUs also for chalking out a joint action strategy. Talks are also being held with banks and rail unions for participating in the strike. The strike will happen either jointly or independently by NTPC staff, he said."

NTPC had earlier signed pacts with cab aggregators for creation of public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles
   -  istock.com/Lyudinka


 State-owned NTPC on Wednesday said it is working on electric vehicle charging infrastructure as it believes that ultimately mobility through EVs will help. 
 NTPC Executive Director Mohit Bhargava said electric vehicle is a good concept but the larger issue is related to the battery.
 “NTPC is working strongly on the electric vehicle side. On the charging network side,” Bhargava said addressing India Energy Summit here.
 “There is a larger issue on the battery side...the life of the battery and how do you reuse the battery,” he added. 
NTPC had earlier said it has signed pacts with cab aggregators Ola, Lithium, Shuttl, Bikxie, Bounce, Electrie and Zoom Car for creation of public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.
 The collaboration with these aggregators will lead to development of charging infrastructure for various vehicle segments and effective utilisation of public charging infrastructure, NTPC had said."

9,2019-11-18,NTPC,"NTPC: Buy call option to bet on bounce back 
The long and medium outlooks for NTPC (₹117.35) appear negative, as long as the stock rules below ₹145. In the short-term, the stock may show some resilient. While the immediate support appears at ₹113, a close below ₹105 has the potential to trigger a fresh fall on the stock. On the other hand, it finds immediate resistance at ₹123 and the next one at ₹135. We expect the stock to move in a range with an upward bias, given the current fall.
F&O pointers: The NTPC November futures added open interest on Friday despite a decline in the share price, signalling short-build up. Option trading indicates that NTPC could move in a range of ₹115-120.
Strategy: We advise traders to buy ₹120-call on NTPC. The option closed at a premium of ₹1.60. As the market lot is 4,800 shares, this would cost investors ₹7,680. The premium (₹7,680) paid would be the maximum loss one can suffer in this. For that to happen, NTPC has to stick below ₹120. As only a close above ₹121.60 will turn the position profitable, we advise, traders who can afford to take the risk should only consider this strategy.
Book profits if the stock moves to ₹123. Traders could exit the position if the loss mounts to ₹1,500.
Alternatively, traders, with a high-risk appetite, could consider going long on NTPC futures with a stop-loss at ₹113. If the stock opens on a positive note, the stop-loss can be shifted to ₹117 and aim for an initial target of ₹123 with trailing stop-losses.
Follow-up: ICICI Bank moved on expected lines. Those who could not book profits can consider holding it for another week."
8,2019-11-22,NTPC,"NTPC shares gain 3% 
The public sector thermal power producer NTPC Ltd was up 3.08 per cent intraday and topped the gainers' list on the Nifty index on Friday.
The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) has given in-principal approval for the sale of Government's holding in NEEPCO (100% - GoI holding ) and THDC India Ltd (75% holding) to NTPC. 
The share touched its 52-week high of Rs 145.85 and a 52-week low of Rs 106.75 on July 1, 2019 and February 13, 2019, respectively.
As per JM Financial's recommendations, the acquisition of these new capacities (including under-construction) adds 5 GW (10% of NTPC capacity) of mostly hydropower assets to NTPC’s largely coal dominated asset base. 
THDC is the better assets with superior RoEs while NEEPCO is sub-optimal. Hence, its acquisition value should also reflect the same. 
Also, a higher debt-funded acquisition would be more value accretive for NTPC, given it has access to low-cost debt. We find both additions to be earnings accretive for NTPC at the fair value and with NTPC’s strong balance sheet (FY19 net D/E at 1.3x) and annual profits of INR 100-120bn these are easily funded from 2-3 years of internal accruals."

6,2019-12-19,NTPC,"NTPC rejects foreign emissions tech, shuts out GE, others from $2 bn orders 
 Top electricity generator NTPC has rejected the emissions-cutting technology of GE and other foreign firms for its coal-fired plants, documents show, shutting them out of an estimated $2 billion in orders.
Despite struggling with some of the world’s worst air pollution levels, India has already pushed back a deadline to cut emission levels to up to 2022, after extensive lobbying by power producers who cited high costs and technical difficulties. The rejection of the foreign technology comes at a time when over half of coal-fired plants in India are already set to miss a phased deadline starting December 2019 to cut emissions of lung diseases-causing sulphur oxides.
State-run NTPC, which generates a quarter of India’s electricity, held talks with foreign firms including General Electric Co, Norway-based Yara International and Japan-based Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems over the potential purchase of filters that lower emissions of smog-causing nitrogen oxide. However, none of the pilot tests it conducted met key emissions parameters, NTPC said in a presentation submitted last month to the Central Pollution Control Board.
“The pilot tests concluded that both selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technologies currently available are not suitable for installation at power plants in India,” it said in the presentation reviewed by Reuters, referring to technologies used to cut emissions of nitrogen oxides. Thermal power companies produce three-quarters of the country’s electricity and account for some 80% of India’s industrial emissions of sulphur oxides that cause lung diseases and smog-creating nitrogen oxides.
NTPC had presented cost estimates in 2016 for the installation of the technology to cut nitrogen oxides throughout its network of power plants. According to Reuters calculations based on those estimates, the cost would total $2.4 billion, although industry consultants said recently that those costs could now be 25% lower. The utility wants a dilution in nitrogen oxide emissions standards and claimed in last month’s presentation that the lowered standards can be achieved with minor retrofits, without the need to install new equipment.
Pilot tests 
The pollution board held a stakeholder meeting on November 7, an audio recording of which was reviewed by Reuters. In the meeting, GE and Yara representatives rejected NTPC’s views, saying their technologies were proven worldwide, according to the recording and two sources present at the meeting. NTPC did not attend the meeting. NTPC, and the Indian units of GE and Yara did not respond to detailed Reuters questionnaires seeking comment. Mitsubishi Hitachi did not immediately respond to a request for comment made on its website.
NTPC said in the earlier presentation to the pollution board that high ash content in Indian coal posed challenges to installing SCR technology and that SNCR did not meet key parameters. The foreign companies responded, saying pilot tests were run in a constrained environment and that commercial use of the equipment, which requires some changes to the plant, would cut emissions to the required levels.
“The conditions for the (pilot) test was that we can not touch special parts at all, we can’t touch furnace tubes. NTPC did not allow us,” Senthilvel Rangasamy, a GE representative, said in the meeting. Premchand Talreja, the managing director of the Indian unit of Yara, said the pilot tests achieved the desired results.
“There should not be doubt on the technology itself,” Talreja said in the meeting. Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and previously a member of a European Union technical working group on emissions by coal-fired utilities, said India has failed to curtail emissions due to “delay and misinformation tactics by the power industry”.
“The power industry managed to build a myth that Indian coal is so special that technologies proven on a wide range of coal types elsewhere need to be tested and validated again in India before the standards can be implemented,” Myllyvirta told Reuters."
5,2019-12-20,NTPC,"NTPC eyes insolvency hit Avantha’s Jhabua Power Project 


NTPC Limited is expected to place its first bid for a stressed asset under the Insolvency Bankruptcy framework soon.
According to officials in the know, NTPC is going to bid for the Jhabua Power project in Madhya Pradesh. NTPC is currently in the process of conducting due diligence for the project, but it largely meets the desired requisites.
NTPC officials said that they would want to bid for projects that are operational and nearer to sources of coal.
This project is a subsidiary of Avantha Power & Infrastructure Limited. JPL currently has 600 MW thermal power generation capacity fully operational and 660 MW under implementation.
Financial creditors have raised claims of more than ₹5,066 crore against JPL. Of these, claims of ₹1,034.5 crore have been raised by Power Finance Corporation while ₹732.03 crore have been raised by the State Bank of India.
The Avantha Group was founded by Gautam Thapar. The Group has business interests in diverse areas, including pulp and paper, power transmission and distribution equipment and services, food processing, farm forestry, chemicals, energy, infrastructure, information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services.
The Group companies include Crompton Greaves Limited, India's largest power equipment company, Ballarpur Industries Limited (BILT), India's largest paper manufacturer, both listed on the Indian stock exchanges and Avantha Power & Infrastructure Limited (APIL) amongst others.
Insolvency proceedings against JPL have been initiated by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in March this year."

NTPC Ltd is the world’s most-loved power producer by equity analysts, and yet its shares are trading near a 10-month low. Why?
The New Delhi-based company is the top rated stock among the world’s largest utilities, with a recommendation consensus of 4.9 on a Bloomberg scale where 5 is a unanimous buy. Analysts expect the company to wring more profit from soon-to-be acquired hydro-power assets, helping it lift its earnings and share price.
The hydro assets to be acquired offer significant scope to improve efficiency and boost profitability, analysts at SBICap Securities Ltd wrote in a recent note after a government panel approved the sale of stakes in generators THDC India Ltd and North Eastern Electric Power Corp to NTPC.
NTPC trades at 8.5 times projected earnings for the next fiscal year, the fourth-cheapest among members of Indias S&P BSE Sensex. All but one of the 26 analysts covering the company rate it a buy, with a return potential of 34 per cent, the third-highest among Sensex members.
Profit took a hit over the last two years due to disruptions in coal supplies, but the fundamentals are now priced in and valuation is near historic lows, said Rupesh D Sankhe, an analyst at Elara Capital India Pvt. in Mumbai. Capacity addition in the next two years will drive earnings growth.
“Unlike private sector rivals, NTPC’s revenue doesn’t depend on India’s demand for power -- which slumped for a fourth straight month in November. The company, which supplies power to state electricity boards, is assured a 15.5 per cent return so long as it keeps its plants running 85 per cent of the time, according to Rohit Natarajan,” an analyst at Antique Stock Broking Ltd.
“Private sector players have systemic issues of some or the other form, while NTPC has remained unscathed and has a matured predictable business model. The consensus view is completely justified,” , said Natarajan."

NTPC currently has over 900 MW of commissioned renewable energy projects

NTPC currently has over 900 MW of commissioned renewable energy projects
   -  The Hindu


 NTPC Ltd wants to completely shift away from the business of procuring renewable energy and then selling it at a small margin to State governments.
According to officials in the know, NTPC now wants to focus on increasing its renewable energy generation capacity and leave the renewable power procurement responsibility to the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). NTPC and SECI had independently started calling for bids from renewable energy project developers to build confidence for achieving the clean energy goals of the centre. These two Central government agencies would procure power from the developers and then sell it to a power distribution company (Discom) at a margin of around 6-7 paisa per unit. 
The move would insulate the clean energy project developers from haggling with State government-controlled Discoms that are notorious for delaying payments and renegotiating signed contracts.
According to officials in the know, NTPC has commissioned around 3,600 MW of projects from where it procures power and another 3,000 MW if such projects are under implementation. 
The plan next year is to bid out just 1,200 MW of projects under this model, unless specifically asked by the government.
“The company’s focus in the next financial year will be commissioning 500 MW of NTPC’s own solar power generation capacity. The power generator wants to focus on having a larger renewable energy portfolio and eyes a clean energy generation capacity as large as its thermal portfolio some time in the future,” a top company official said.
NTPC currently has over 900 MW of commissioned renewable energy projects comprising 11 solar photo-voltaic projects with a capacity of 870 MW and one wind energy project of 50 MW. The total installed power generation capacity of the NTPC group stands at 57,356 MW.
Analysts had also starting picking holes in the power purchase agreements (PPAs) that NTPC and SECI had signed with project developers. In July this year, an India Ratings & Research report said the two are lowering their obligations towards payments to renewable energy companies in the PPAs they are signing if the Discom defaults.
Earlier this year, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission also refused to approve the trading margin charged by SECI for these projects. Both NTPC and SECI are since then expected to negotiate their trading margins with the states for each such project."
2,2019-12-30,NTPC,"Why NTPC is a good buy now
Power generation in India has been falling with shrinking industrial production.
This has prompted some investors to wonder if it makes sense to own stocks of power- generating companies. As a result, stocks such as NTPC have taken a pounding in the past six months. The stock has fallen nearly 20 per cent since BusinessLine’s last ‘buy’ call in May 2019.
But the fall in the stock price presents a good buying opportunity for investors with a long-term perspective.
The current dividend yield is a healthy 4.7 per cent. Besides, the stock is trading at a 12-month trailing price-to-earnings multiple of about eight times, below its three-year average multiple of about 11.5 times.
 








 
The company’s fundamentals and its long-term business prospects seem sound.
Also, many of its under-construction projects are expected to come on stream in the next few years; this should add to earnings growth.
Several factors have weighed on the NTPC stock over the past few months. One, its electricity generation fell 3.2 per cent y-o-y to 145.3 billion units in the first half of FY20.
This was primarily due to the industrial slowdown that dampened the demand for power. The growth in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) had been negative from August to October this year. Around 40 per cent of electricity demand comes from the industrial sector. A longer-than-usual monsoon, too, resulted in lower electricity production from thermal sources.
There were also fuel supply issues at NTPC’s 3,000 MW Talcher thermal plant in Odisha.
Frequent strikes by workers at Mahanadi Coalfields, a subsidiary of Coal India, impacted the availability of fuel at the Talcher plant. Other plants at Sipat, Farakka, Rihand and Korba also faced fuel shortage.
Due to these shortages, NTPC could not recover fixed costs to the tune of ₹332 crore in the July-September quarter of 2019.
The impending acquisition of THDC and NEEPCO by NTPC, approved by Union Cabinet recently, also dragged down the latter’s stock. The acquisitions will likely be completed by March 31, 2020, to help the Centre meet its revenue targets.
While NTPC has decent cash balances, it will have to resort to debt to complete the acquisition of the two companies. Although the acquired companies will be earnings accretive for NTPC in the long run, the debt that will have to be taken for the acquisition is causing uncertainty.
 
NTPC has been posting good financial results. In FY19, its consolidated revenue grew about 9 per cent y-o-y to ₹95,742 crore while its profit rose about 20 per cent to ₹12,640 crore.
NTPC’s consolidated revenue during the September 2019 quarter at ₹24,460 crore was up about 5 cent y-o-y. Its consolidated profit grew much faster at about 38 per cent to ₹3,409 crore.
The strong rise in profit was aided by a three-fold rise in other income as the company booked late payment surcharge (18 per cent a year) to discoms that had not paid their dues.
Receivables more than doubled year-on-year to over ₹19,400 crore as of September 2019, as state distribution companies delayed payments; this has led to a spike in late payment surcharge.
For bills raised after August 1, 2019, NTPC has been getting its payments regularly, as all power purchases by discoms have to be backed by a letter of credit.
This has helped it curb the rise in interest costs during the September quarter.
In the June 2019 quarter, NTPC posted tepid numbers as rules prescribed under a deviation settlement mechanism had led to some large under-recovery of fixed costs. These rules were then rolled back and the impact was restricted to the June 2019 quarter.
NTPC had missed its target of commissioning projects in FY19, but things have improved since then. As per its plan to front-load most of its projects to be commissioned in FY 20, the company has commissioned 3.17 GW of projects at the standalone level and 4.5 GW at the group level till now, against a target of 3.97 GW at standalone level and 5.29 GW at the group level for FY20.
These projects, having been capitalised in accounting terms, will soon start earning returns for the company. As long as NTPC continues to commission projects, as guided, its profit should continue to rise steadily.
Add to this the high current dividend yield, and the stock has the potential to offer good upside to investors."
1,2019-12-30,NTPC,"NTPC to shell out ₹15,000 crore to buy out NEEPCO, THDCIL from Centre
 NTPC will be forking out close to ₹15,000 crore this fiscal to buy out the Centre’s stake in North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO) and THDC India Ltd (THDCIL).
According to company officials in the know, NTPC is planning to complete the buyout by the end of FY20 in a bid to aid the Centre that is struggling to meet its disinvestment targets. So far this fiscal, the Centre has mobilised ₹17,364.26 crore through disinvestments. It has a target to garner ₹1,05,000 crore through disinvestment proceeds before the end of the current fiscal.
According to the annual report of these companies for FY19, the net worth of NEEPCO was ₹6,301.29 crore and that of THDCIL was ₹9,280.78 crore as on March 31, 2019.
Last month, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved the strategic disinvestment of five Central Public Sector Enterprises including THDCIL (formerly Tehri Hydro Development Corporation India Ltd) and NEEPCO. The Centre has 100 per cent shareholding in NEEPCO. In THDC, it has 74.23 per cent shareholding, with the rest held by the Uttar Pradesh government.
Going by the net worth valuation of these companies at the end of FY19, the Centre will be getting at least ₹13,190.41 crore (₹6,889.12 crore for THDCIL and ₹6,301.29 crore for NEEPCO) by shedding its stake in them.
NTPC will also have to pay a premium for the transfer of management control from the Centre. According to sector watchers, this could push the total outgo from the company’s coffers to the exchequer to nearly ₹15,000 crore.
THDCIL presently has 1,513 MW of installed power generation capacity. It has two hydro generating stations — Tehri HPP (4X250 MW) and Koteshwar HEP (4X100 MW) — and two operational wind power plants in Gujarat, one at Patan (25X2 MW) and another at Devbhumi Dwarka (30X2.1 MW). NEEPCO currently operates seven hydropower, three thermal and one solar power project with a combined installed capacity of 1,457 MW."
