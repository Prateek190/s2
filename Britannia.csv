15,2018-05-21,Britannia,"Britannia to set aside ₹500 crore for a food manufacturing unit in Ranjangaon
Britannia Industries has assigned a capex of ₹500 crore this year for the setting up of a manufacturing base at Ranjangaon in Maharashtra. 
With the intention of transforming itself from a biscuits to a foods company, it has set up a food park in Ranjangaon, in the milk producing belt, to make its cakes, rusks, croissants and engage in dairy processing, apart from its mainstay, biscuits.
“Biscuit is still 85 per cent of our turnover of ₹10,200 crore, but we intend adding other products in the macro-snacking category. This year our largest capex will be for our Ranjangaon plant at ₹500 crore, which will get raised to ₹1,000 crore,’’ said Varun Berry, Managing Director.
Segments like dairy, where Britannia has been trying to make a mark, will also get a fresh impetus through its new manufacturing facility.
“Dairy is not going to be easy like the rest of the products, but the facility at Ranjangaon should be able to manufacture dairy products in the next two years. Today, dairy contributes 5 per cent of the turnover, but we should be able to take it to 10 per cent in the next three years with a turnover of ₹800 crore,’’ he said.
Considering itself as the Number 2 player after Amul in the cheese category, Britannia has pegged its product at a premium to its competitors. 
“Dairy is a large category but we have the ability to distribute and manufacture products like cheese and if we can also get into the back-end with milk processing, there is no reason why we cannot dominate the category,” he said. 
Recently, MNCs such as Kraft Heinz and Danone have either exited or scaled down their dairy operations.
Meanwhile, despite being a market leader in biscuits, Britannia has catching up to do in the value segment, where it is pitted against Parle and its dominant brand of Parle G in the mass glucose segment.
“The heat is medium in terms of competitive intensity. But, we are nowhere close to Parle in volume shares, as they are way ahead of us,’’ he admitted.
Celebrating its centenary year as a corporate entity, Britannia’s challenge now is to expedite its transformation from a biscuits to a foods company. As Berry says: “The challenge is how we can spread our wings and get into new categories and be looked upon as a foods company in the next three years.’’"

Britannia Industries, the country’s largest biscuit-maker, will invest ₹ 300 crore as capex towards its dairy business. While it will invest towards an integrated unit either in Maharashtra or Andhra Pradesh, a substantial investment will also go towards setting up of a cold chain network.  
According to Nusli Wadia, Chairman, Britannia Industries, the company is mulling the possibility of shifting its dairy unit from Maharashtra to Andhra Pradesh. Delayed clearances by the Maharashtra Government has been an issue for the company. 
“We are yet to take a call on whether to set up the dairy project in Maharashtra or Andhra,” he told reporters post the company’s 99th Annual General Meeting.
Britannia will not enter into fresh milk segment, but will look at value-added products. The company will also spend on capex and up the ante on new products that include rusk, cakes, croissants and dairy products. 
“We will grow by strengthening our brands. That is what we have done so far,” Wadia said. 
“Good Day is likely to be no 1 biscuit brand in the country, beating ParleG in the next few years,” he added.  
To celebrate its 100 years of establishment, the company has opted for a new logo. This apart, Britannia will also launch a slew of new products over the next six months. At least 50 new products have been lined up. 
The board of directors, meanwhile, has recommended and approved issue of secured redeemable non-convertible debentures as bonus debentures of ₹ 60 in the ratio of one bonus debenture for every one equity shares held. The scheme, however, needs the approval of NCLT. 
The board has also decided to consider a share split. A board meet on August 23 to consider sub-division of equity shares of the company will be held. The present face value of equity shares is Rs 2 each.  
Britannia Industries has reported a near 18 per cent jump in standalone net profit to ₹ 246 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. Net profit for the corresponding quarter last fiscal stood at ₹ 209 crore. 
Net sales (standalone) for the quarter under ₹ 2387 crore. According to a notification to the bourses, the sales are not comparable on account of implementation of GST and a change in accounting standards. 
However, on a comparative basis, net sales saw a 15 per cent, year-on-year, jump."

Britannia Industries, the country’s second largest food company, is looking at an overseas expansion plan driven primarily through its own manufacturing facilities.
The company is evaluating countries such as Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nigeria, Kenya and Egypt to set up units.
It is likely to zero in on Africa. Parle already manufacture there and Britannia will compete in that market, Edelweiss Securities said in a report.
According to Britannia MD Varun Berry, the company’s strategy is to open a manufacturing facility every year in a new country.
“We are yet to finalise on a particular country for this year. (Bangladesh) is certainly one on our list. As of now, the focus is on Africa and SAARC,” he told BusinessLine in an interview.
The company currently has three manufacturing facilities outside India — one each in Dubai and Oman that it had acquired, and a greenfield one in Nepal. It also exports to the US and nearly 80 other countries across Asia, West Asia and Africa. Around 13 of these countries were added in FY18.
According to Berry, Britannia expects its international business to contribute 15 per cent of its turnover in five years.
Flattish growth
The international business accounts for 7 per cent of the company’s ₹9,906-crore turnover (consolidated). In Q1 FY19, its growth remained flat due to a slowdown in West Asia and Africa.
Other geographies such as Australia, the US and Canada, too, have seen a decline in demand; political troubles in countries such as Yemen and Libya have also had an impact.
According to Abneesh Roy, Senior Vice-President, Institutional Equities, Edelweiss Securities, it makes “long-term strategy sense” for Britannia to enter new markets and set up manufacturing facilities there.
“When you look at other Indian FMCG companies, you will see a substantial part of their revenues coming from Africa and overseas operations. Biscuit-makers too can look at these opportunities depending on the geographies they want to operate in,” he said.
Focus on profits
The company, Berry said, is open to inorganic growth and acquisitions or joint venture partnerships for setting up facilities overseas. While overseas expansion will be “slow and steady”, it will not be at the cost of profitability. Nepal for instance, is one market where operations are profitable.
“We are going to be aggressive as far as international expansion is concerned. But we are not going to break the bank on it,” he said, adding that the investment in these geographies have to pay back in five years.
“We are not in the market to say that we are okay with being profitable after 20 years. It is going to be payback in five years,” Berry said.
Earlier this year, Britannia commissioned a dedicated exports unit in Mundra, Gujarat."
11,2018-08-13,Britannia,"All you wanted to know about...Bonus Debentures
Indian investors love bonus shares and have a marked aversion to companies that raise debt. So, what should they make of companies that mix and match the two and issue bonus debentures? Last week, Britannia Industries announced a bonus debenture issue to mark its centenary year.
What is it?
Similar to bonus shares and dividends, companies issue bonus debentures to reward their equity shareholders. The company allots these debentures, free of cost, to its shareholders at face value. Shareholders receive interest on them at a pre-determined rate at fixed intervals until maturity. When the debentures mature, they are redeemed and the principal amount (the face value of the debenture) is paid out to shareholders. Bonus debentures may also be listed on the stock exchange in which case holders can sell them at market prices. Britannia Industries for example, is issuing one debenture of ₹60 each for every equity share of face value ₹2 for a tenure of three years, at an interest rate not exceeding 8 per cent, to be paid annually.
Issuance of bonus debentures is not as common as bonus shares or dividends as they are not expressly provided for in the Companies Act. They are issued under a ‘scheme of arrangement’ which involves approval from shareholders, the Court and the RBI and in some cases, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.
Only a handful of companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Britannia Industries, Blue Dart Express, Dr Reddy’s Labs and NTPC have issued bonus debentures in the past.
Why is it important?
From the perspective of the company, issue of bonus debentures does not entail immediate cash outgo like dividends. Hence the money retained until the maturity of the instrument can be used to fund new projects or acquisitions. There is no question of equity dilution too unlike in the issue of bonus shares. Also, interest paid on the debentures can be claimed as an expense by the company for tax purposes, thereby helping reduce its tax incidence. Since the issue of bonus debentures involves transfer of money from the reserves of the company to debt, this move will boost its return on equity. At the same time, this will lead to an increase in the debt to equity ratio. While companies with low debt may benefit from leverage, for high-debt companies, this may not be an ideal route to reward shareholders.
Why should I care?
Bonus debentures aren’t exactly tax-payer friendly. The sums companies distribute by way of bonus debentures are treated as dividends under Sec 2(22) (b) of the Income Tax Act and hence are subject to dividend distribution tax in the hands of the company. Shareholders are taxed for dividends above ₹10 lakh and bonus debentures are taken into consideration for this calculation too. The interest you earn on the debentures attracts tax at your slab rate. If you choose to sell the debentures in the market, you will have to pay short-term capital gains tax on your gains if you sell within three years or else, long-term capital gains tax. When you sell bonus shares on the other hand, long-term capital gains up to ₹1 lakh is exempt from tax and gains above that are taxed at 10 per cent. This apart, liquidity may be a concern for bonus debentures as traded volumes may be thin and hence, you may not be able to sell the desired quantity at the desired price.
Once a company declares it, the wait for bonus debentures may be long, given the many regulatory approvals. For instance, from approval by its Board in March 2010 to actual allotment in March 2011, the bonus debenture issue of Dr Reddy’s Labs took a year to fructify.
The bottomline
Bonus debentures may appear to be win-win for both shareholders and the company, but there is more to it than what meets the eye."
12,2018-08-14,Britannia,"Big bonus for Britannia shareholders
Shareholders of Britannia Industries had reasons to smile last week. Apart from posting a double-digit growth in revenues and profits in the quarter-ended June 2018, the company announced ‘bonus debentures’ for its shareholders in a gesture to mark its centenary year in business. The company will issue one bonus debenture of ₹60 each for one equity share of ₹2 each, totalling ₹721 crore. The bonus debentures will carry a charge on certain immovable assets of the company, will have a maturity period of three years and will be traded both in the National as well as the Bombay Stock Exchanges. While the exact coupon rate on these instruments will be determined by the Board, it will not exceed 8 per cent. Interest will be paid annually. 
On a strong footing
After the dent due to demonetisation and GST, Britannia has been clocking double-digit top and bottom-line growth in the last few quarters. In the latest June quarter, its consolidated revenues grew by 13.6 per cent year-on-year to ₹2,527 crore, while net profits moved up by 19.4 per cent Y-o-Y to touch ₹258 crore. The company’s prospects appear bright. 
It is reinvigorating its dairy business by setting up a fully integrated dairy operation at Ranjangaon in Maharashtra. Focus on value-added products such as whey and skimmed milk powder in this facility will improve margins.
Britannia is also sprucing up its product portfolio and entering the croissants and snacks segments shortly. It has planned a host of premium biscuit launches this year as well. The company is working on improving its rural footprint and its presence in States such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan, in which it has traditionally been weak. 
The bonus debenture issue will push up its debt. But this is not a cause for concern. The company has been able to reduce debt in the last five years. Its debt-to-equity ratio has come down from 0.39 in the year ended March 31, 2014 to 0.05 in fiscal 2018. 
Considering that only about one-fifth of the total of ₹1,000 crore envisaged for the dairy facility has been spent in fiscal 2018, the development of this facility would require more capital spending in the next two to three years. Unlike dividends, bonus debentures do not entail immediate outflow of cash, as the principal amount will be paid to the shareholders only on maturity. 
Thus, along with internal accruals, this amount will come in handy to fund the expansion. Besides, it also allows room for acquisitions or further capital spends.
Britannia’s retained earnings (P&L account balance and general reserves) have moved up from ₹750.5 crore five years ago to ₹3,318.6 crore as on March 31, 2018. The company’s cash and cash equivalents (including current investments), as of March 31, 2018 stood at ₹1,044 crore, more than three times higher than the previous fiscal.
The bonus debenture issue entails transfer of funds from reserves to debt. So, the company’s return on equity, which stood at 32.9 per cent in fiscal 2018 (against 36.9 per cent in fiscal 2017), could rise this year.
Rich valuation
The Britannia Industries stock, however, did not react much to the bonus debentures announcement last Monday, and closed the day with a 1 per cent fall. However, the stock has been the darling of the market in the last few years. 
Since the market rally that began in mid-2013, it has moved up eight-fold to about ₹6,336 now. It now trades at a rich valuation of over 70 times its trailing 12-month consolidated earnings. Considering the huge rise in the stock price, the company is considering a stock-split in its board meeting on August 23."

Britannia Industries, the country’s second largest food company, is looking to strengthen its “adjacencies” portfolio. From cakes, rusk and breads, the adjacencies category has now been extended to include croissants, cream wafers and ‘salty’ snacks. More extensions will be looked at in the coming days.
The cream wafers were launched October 2018 onwards in South India markets and are now being launched nationally while the salty snacks portfolio is still restricted in the southern region. Plans are afoot to take it national soon.
On the other hand, croissant — one of the categories that the company has been focussing on — have had their national roll-out last month onwards. While they were extended to modern trade initially, offerings are now being taken to kirana shops and general trade.
Britannia’s core business continues to be its biscuits portfolio with approximately 70 per cent of its turnover coming from this vertical. This apart, it has a diary vertical that contributes around 5 per cent.
According to Jayant Kapre, Vice-President & Head Adjacency Businesses, Britannia Industries Ltd, the segment (adjacencies business) is expected to contribute 20 per cent of the company’s turnover in FY20.
Of these, new launches will see a revenue contribution of 3-5 per cent in the first full year of operations (April 2019 — March 2020).
“We are looking to expand the adjacencies portfolio and have added three new categories that include croissants, salty snacks and cream wafers. There are other products that are lined up and we can add another new category sometime soon,” he told BusinessLine.
For Britannia, increasing focus on the non-biscuit, non-diary business means an increase in R&D and additional capex.
The company’s Bengaluru R&D centre, Kapre says, is well geared to work on “accelerating into neighbouring categories”. Moreover, a new team of R&D personnel has been brought in to focus on development of the adjacencies segment.
Britannia has so far put in a ₹20-crore capex to set-up a plant for the salty snacks portfolio at Bengaluru. Capacities can be ramped-up “as required”, Kapre said.
The cream wafers are currently being made through contract manufacturing and the company “may look at expanding capacities” depending on the “response it gets”.
Incidentally, croissants will be Britannia’s big bet.
The company has entered into a 60:40 JV with Chipita of Greece. Around ₹100 crore has been invested to set up a new line at the Ranjangaon unit near Pune in Maharashtra.
Market sources say the business could be a ₹200-250 crore segment for Britannia in 2-3 years. But, a category market needs to be created first. Incidentally, there are no major national players in the segment.
“Croissant is a new market that we are building on, rather creating. However, we have, in the past, created markets for rusks and cakes,” he pointed out.
In fact, the company has opted for two flavours to flag-off the category while the greater focus will be to build the market."

Producers of household items have been India’s best stock market bets for years. But the consumption slowdown in the world's fastest-growing major economy is rubbing the sheen off these shares.
The 74-member S&P BSE Fast-Moving Consumer Goods Index, which has had only one down year since 2006, has bucked the gains in the nation's benchmark measure. Some of the biggest names in the gauge have accumulated double-digit losses five months into the year.
The consumption engine is sputtering as the cash crunch caused by the crisis in the shadow-banking sector has curbed spending even on staples after hurting demand for cars and homes. Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), whose soaps and detergents are used by nine out of 10 Indian households, in an analysts call on Friday pinned the deceleration on weak rural demand and said it is unable to say when the buoyancy of the past would return.
When a generally-measured management like HUL’s uses the term recession in its comments in the post-result presser, it generally is not a one-quarter blip, analysts led by Rohit Chordia at Kotak Institutional Equity Research wrote in a note on the weekend.
The company’s volume growth slowed to seven per cent in the March quarter after five straight quarters of double-digit expansion. Growth for Dabur India Limited during the period was 4.3 per cent compared with about eight per cent a year earlier. Britannia Industries Limited grew seven per cent, versus 11 per cent, and Godrej Consumer Products Limited posted a one per cent increase in its domestic branded-business volumes.
The market is repricing the growth outlook. HUL has declined 5.8 per cent in 2019, Godrej Consumer 21 per cent, Britannia 15 per cent and Dabur 11 per cent. The S&P BSE Fast-Moving Consumer Index trades at a 12-month blended forward price-to-earning of 32, higher than its five-year average, signaling potential for further contraction in values."

 FMCG major Britannia Industries on Wednesday dispelled speculations over the resignation of its Managing Director Varun Berry from the company.
 Terming the speculations as “false” as well as “incorrect and baseless”, Britannia Industries said, Berry was re-appointed as the Managing Director for five years effectively from April 1, 2019, following his six years stint in the company from 2013.
 “There have been false speculations over the last few days on Varun Berry’s resignation from the company. We would like to clarify that these rumours are incorrect and baseless,” Britannia Industries said in a statement. According to the company, Britannia Industries has seen strong results in Berry’s tenure and is trying to be a “global total foods company“.
 Berry had joined Britannia Industries, which owns popular brands as Good Day, Tiger, Milk Bikis and Marie Gold, from food and beverage firm PepsiCo in 2013. In FY2018-19, Britannia Industries, which operates in segments as biscuits, bread, cakes, rusk, and dairy products, had revenue of Rs 10,482.45 crore."

FMCG major Britannia Industries is looking at a 4-5 per cent price hike across categories to offset a similar rise in raw material costs.
According to Varun Berry, Managing Director, Britannia, price hikes will be across specific categories, or, in “select premium” range or across specific geographies.
The company initiated a 10 per cent price hike in the dairy categories, a month back. The hike came after “milk prices went through the roof”.
A seven per cent year-on-year rise in raw material costs to ₹1,368 crore for the April to June 2019 period (against ₹1271 crore), saw its bottomline take a hit.
During this period, Britannia witnessed a 4 per cent dip in profit after tax (consolidated) to ₹249 crore ( ₹258 crore).
Consolidated revenue from operations was ₹2,700 crore — up 6 per cent for the period under review.
“Price increase will become important for us in doing business in the dairy segment, especially where prices of milk have gone through the roof. In bakery, the inflation is reasonable,” Berry said here.
“This is a slowdown year and we do not want to affect consumer sentiments any further. So a 4-5 per cent price rise is what we are looking at across specific pack sizes. Hikes could be done selectively in regions too,” he added.
Demand, the company estimates, will pick up over the next 6-15 months. And so, “price hikes have to be taken where the impact isn’t large”.
According to Berry, despite the slowdown, there will be “no cuts” in advertisement and marketing spends. In fact, the company sees slowdown as an opportunity to push spends, build on new categories and penetrate further in markets where it has a lesser dominance over competition.
Nusli N Wadia, Chairman, in response to a shareholder query during the annual general meeting earlier in the day, said that Britannia “will continue to concentrate on brand building”.
“We have actually gained market share. We did not pull back and continue to aggressively spend on advertisements and sales promotion,” Berry said.
Slowdown also gives Britannia the opportunity to consolidate its market share from regional players who face liquidity, production and distribution issues. 
The Wadia Group company has a third market share in the ₹30,000-crore biscuit market in India, with regional players occupying 27 per cent of the market.
Britannia, in line with its plans, is looking at overseas manufacturing facilities. These facilities would primarily be company-owned.
While the Nepal facility began operations earlier this fiscal, it has zeroed-in on Bangladesh through a third-party (contract manufacturing) arrangement. 
The company is also looking at opportunities in Africa and South-East Asian nations. Britannia exports to 70-odd countries.
In India, it is looking to focus on the east and north-east markets through expansion in manufacturing and deeper distribution of offerings in places like Arunachal Pradesh.
While Britannia is setting up its second manufacturing facility in Bihar, it will look at another facility in Bengal or expand its existing facility in Assam. 
“The ballpark capex could be in the range of ₹150 crore. But it’s a decision we will look at one year down the line,” Berry said."

Britannia Industries eyes fresh capex of ₹200 crore over a three-year-period to expand its ‘adjacencies’ portfolio. The capex will go mostly towards manufacturing.
After biscuits, which account for a majority of the company’s turnover, adjacencies is its second largest revenue-generating segment. Adjacencies include offerings like cakes, rusks, salty snacks, crème wafers and other non-biscuit offerings. Diary is the third largest operating vertical for the company.
Adjacencies is a ₹2,000-crore business for Britannia and accounts for 20 per cent of its ₹10,500-crore turnover .
According to Jayant Kapre, Head – Bread, Cake, Rusk and Adjacency Business, Britannia Industries has already “committed” an investment of ₹300 crore, and a major part of this has already been invested.
“Another ₹200 crore is expected to be made over the next three years, mostly into manufacturing,” he told BusinessLine without specifying the details.
In the recently launched croissant category, where Britannia entered into a joint venture with Greek company Chipita, efforts are being made to “ramp up capacities” and get “to a national launch very quickly”.
Scale-up will happen in newer categories like salty snacks (mostly baked offerings) and cream wafers. Small value packs and regional flavours are also being looked at. The two categories put together have a run rate (annualised sales) of ₹100 crore.
“We believe there is headroom for growth. Snacking is a ₹25,000-crore market and even if we manage a one per cent market share there, it is ₹250-crore turnover,” Kapre said.
Britannia has launched its salty snacks primarily in South India. And as a conscious strategy has ensured that the product does not travel long distances. Thus, it is looking at small lines which will co-exist with the present lines of its other bakery products in various parts of the country. “This line (strategy) has given us great results in the South, and we are currently at about 75 per cent capacity utilisation. It will take us slightly over a year to make sure that we become a pan-India brand because the second line is going to come up in Ranjangaon (Maharashtra),” the company’s MD, Varun Berry, had said during an analyst concall."

The country’s largest biscuit-maker, Britannia Industries, is looking to beat slowdown blues through a mix of cost optimisation, “judicious” price hikes and low unit packs (LUPs).
This comes even as the company says “sales growth rate has halved” and there is a decline in consumption across urban and rural markets. According to market sources, rural sales, which earlier were one-and-a-half-times urban sales, have slowed down. They are now growing at a slower pace than urban sales. Sales in the value segment have also been hit.
Varun Berry, MD, Britannia, in a recent analyst call, had maintained that “…even a ₹5 product, if the consumer is thinking twice before buying, then obviously, there is some serious issue in the economy.”
The biscuit major, with a turnover of ₹10,000 crore in FY19, has a near 33 per cent market share.
According to Vinay Subramanyam, Head – Marketing, Britannia will look at region-specific ad campaigns (apart from national ones), across select power brands such as Good Day, Marie Gold, 50-50, Milk Bikis, Treat and NutriChoice.
For instance, the company recently launched a NutriChoice Sugarfree Cracker targeting the Eastern and North-Eastern markets. It has roped in a regional brand ambassador for West Bengal, and come up with smaller value ₹10 packs (in place of the previous ₹13 packs). Low unit packs priced below ₹15 account for the majority of sales in the FMCG sector.
“For us, it is about providing the right value to the customer. This can be done through lower unit priced offerings, among other ways,” he told BusinessLine.
Subramanyam ruled out options like grammage reduction (where the price remains the same, but there is a reduction in weight) and freebies to shore up demand or consumption.
There will, however, be no major ad spend cuts. A report by Edelweiss Securities says that in Q1 FY20, Britannia strengthened its brand equity through focussed campaigns. Ad spend stood at ₹130 crore in the quarter, a 21 per cent jump over the ₹107 crore spent in Q1 FY19.
“There will be judicious price hikes” to the extent that “it does not pinch the consumer”, said Subramanyam. A round of price hikes is expected in Q3 FY20 across select brands and categories. Price hikes were initiated in Q1 primarily across the dairy segment.
This apart, the company is looking at cost optimisation like reduction in freight and carrying cost. Some of the other initiatives here could include closing down unproductive plants, including third party manufacturing units.
“We have to become efficient and for that tough calls have to be taken,” Subramanyam said.
The Edelweiss Securities report says Britannia had “taken a long position in certain commodities such as flour, which has helped in managing inventory.” It is also looking at a cost efficiency of ₹265 crore.
“With a focus on tightening belt in this phase of low growths, the company has accelerated the cost efficiency initiatives to maintain the shape of business,” it further added."

 Britannia Industries is looking to double turnover of its dairy verticals over the next two to three years. 
While there will be a widening of its existing portfolio, plans are also afoot to increase milk procurement too.
The company, which is finalising the capex for the segment, could also explore the possibility of having a new brand apart from the existing eponymous one (Britannia) and ‘Winkin Cow’ (for milk shakes).
Dairy, where offerings are in the value-added segment, accounts for ₹500 crore of turnover annually, and remains a profitable vertical for the ₹10,000-crore Britannia Industries. Sources say the business had a margin of 20 per cent (profit before tax) in FY19.
In the first quarter of this fiscal (April to June), the dairy business was impacted adversely by an inordinate increase in milk prices. 
According to Gunjan Shah, Vice-President – Sales and Head of Diary Business, Britannia plans to stay into the value-added segment where margins are relatively higher when compared to the pouched milk category.
The company will look at “backward integration” with innovations (new products) coming in via extension of its existing offerings like ‘cup-curds’ into “long-shelf life shakes”. 
“The idea is to double the turnover in this category in 2-3 years. We are very sure we want to stay in the value-added space. That’s where it is margin accretive,” he told BusinessLine, during an interview.
While milkshakes in tetra packs were launched last fiscal, the other offerings it is exploring could be in the probiotics space. Moreover, it could also explore the health drink segments (low-sugar and low-fat offerings).
“Probiotics is definitely on the scanner. But not immediately,” Shah added.
According to him, the Winkin’ Cow brand of milk shakes has done “extremely well” for the company and within nine months of its launch, it is currently the No. 2 brand and competes with the likes of ‘Cavin’s’. Moreover, post launch of Winkin’ Cow, the company has been able to ramp up its distribution base by two-and-a-half times.
“We could look at having another brand for culinary experiences,” he said.
Britannia Industries MD, Varun Berry, in a recent analyst call pointed out that in the dairy business (for milk shakes), the company has “employed no capital at all” and it is all “third party manufacturing”.
Britannia is also planning to ramp up its procurement as its dairy line in the Ranjangaon facility (in Maharashtra) goes on-stream. The company has 25-30 milk collection centres in the State and collects up to 25,000 litres, a day. 
“As we set-up our processing plant, the procurement will go up,” Shah said, adding that “eventually the company estimates that it will ramp up procurement to 400,000-500,000 litres a day.”"
