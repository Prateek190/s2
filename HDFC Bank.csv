101,2018-07-23,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank falls 2.3% as profit misses estimates
 Shares of India's biggest lender by market-cap, HDFC Bank, fell as much as 2.3 per cent to Rs 2,138.1, as Q4 profit missed estimates on higher provsioning. 
HDFC Bank had on Saturday reported an 18.2 per cent increase in its net profit for the fist quarter of the fiscal along with stable asset quality. The lender's net profit increased to Rs 4,601.44 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, against Rs 3,893.84 crore in the same period last fiscal. 
Jefferies says that strong cost control offsets weaker topline trajectory, and it has retained buy with a target price of Rs 2,530.
Kotak Institutional Securities says that HDFC Bank has adequate levers to generate healthy operating profit, and earnings growth. However, quality has been disappointing as the bank had to slow down operating expenses to offset NIM pressure.
It has maintained 'reduce' rating, and raised the target price to Rs 2,000 from Rs 1,900. About 44 analysts have rated the stock either 'strong buy' or 'buy'.
HDFC Bank's smaller rival Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd missed June-quarter profit estimates as provisions surged. Up to last close, the stock had risen 16 per cent ytd vs Nifty Bank Index's gain of 5.22 per cent."

 The Rs 24,000-crore capital raising will increase HDFC Bank’s capital buffers by 3 percentage points and help support the lender’s over 20 per cent loan growth for the next few years, says a report.
The Rs 8,500-crore infusion last week through a preferential allotment to parent HDFC will increase the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio by about 1 percentage points to 13.3 per cent from 12.3 reported in March 2018, global rating agency Moody’s Investor Service said in a report today.
This is the first tranche of the Rs 24,000-crore capital raising plan announced last December.
“If the bank manages to raise the remaining planned capital, its CET1 ratio will increase by a total of 3 percentage points to 15.2 per cent,” it added.
The capital infusion is “credit positive” as it will strengthen its loss-absorbing buffers, while supporting balance-sheet expansion, the agency said.
 Moody’s vice-president for financial institutions group, Alka Anbarasu, further said even though HDFC Bank is more profitable than its peers, the internal capital generation “has lagged its risk-weighted assets growth” in the past five years.
 The preferential share sale to the parent is part of a Rs 24,000-crore capital raising plan announced earlier. The remaining money will be raised from overseas investors, for which the bank has got necessary government approvals.
 The bank has not yet revealed the exact timeline for raising the second tranche and the agency says it will not be difficult for the bank to raise the money from equity markets.
 “We expect that the capital raise will support HDFC Banks credit growth of 20-25 per cent over the next few years. HDFC Bank is growing at a faster pace than other banks: its average loan growth has been 22 per cent over the past three years, versus the average of 6.5 per cent for the system,” Anbarasu said."
99,2018-07-31,HDFC Bank,"How ICICI Bank, arms compare with peer HDFC group?
With most of the key subsidiaries listed now, comparison between ICICI Bank and HDFC group shares deserves attention or seems to be well-timed. HDFC and HDFC Bank have been definitely and consistently superior than ICICI Bank in terms of important financial metrics. Accordingly, their shares have significantly outperformed ICICI Bank with market capitalisation jumping more than five and 12 times, respectively, in the last one decade, compared to the latter’s three times, according to Capitaline data.
Even HDFC’s newly-listed subsidiary, HDFC Standard Life Insurance, has done better than ICICI Prudential Life Insurance though listing dates are different. The stock of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance has gained close to 42 per cent in almost two years of listing, while HDFC Standard Life is up 44 per cent in just eight months.
According to analysts, premium valuations of HDFC group’s shares are indeed justified but currently they are fairly valued and most offer limited upside.
On the other hand, ICICI Bank and its subsidiaries, which have underperformed HDFC group due to a variety of reasons, can be considered as value buy, they added.
“While the company (HDFC) is tracking steady core performance, its valuation at 3.1 times adjusted book value for core return on equity of 16.5 per cent appears to be fair,” said Kunal Shah, analyst at Edelweiss. He expects 9 per cent upside from current levels.
ICICI Bank may rise 18%
Prabhudas Lilladher has increased the target price on HDFC Bank by 9 per cent to ₹2,492 (to factor in fund-raising) and retained its ‘buy’ rating on the stock. ICICI Bank also offers similar upside of 18 per cent based on average target prices estimated by analysts on both stocks. If things go well at ICICI Bank financially and otherwise (read management and regulatory issues), then the upsides could be even more, given its rock bottom valuation of 1.2 times price-to-adjusted-book-value estimated for FY20.
“Core operating profit remains healthy (+13 per cent year on year); new NPA addition moderates (slippages at 3.1 per cent of loans) and loan growth (+11 per cent) gathers pace. We see provisions remain elevated in the near term (FY19E); however, we draw comfort in the pace of resolution and 69 per cent coverage ratio (combined) against list-1 and list-2 IBC accounts. Capital position remains healthy; subsidiaries remain profitable. Valuations continue to remain undemanding,” pointed out Centrum in its post-June quarter results.
HDFC Securities has a similar view and added: “Despite building in relatively lower recoveries and cutting earnings by 31 per cent and 5 per cent for FY19 and 20, respectively, ICICI Bank can yield return on average assets of 1.11 per cent in FY20. This, and inexpensive valuations, drive our positive view. Further dilution in subsidiaries and robust recoveries could push earnings upwards.”
Insurance segment
Between the life insurance subsidiaries, analysts are more bullish on ICICI Prudential Life insurance in the near term as they expect 21 per cent upside versus HDFC Standard Life’s 2 per cent. This is mainly due to time correction in the HDFC Standard Life stock thanks to its high valuation following robust listing and post-listing performance.
Also, though HDFC Standard Life is estimated to report higher growth in new business APE (annualised premium equivalent) and VNB (value of new business) over FY18-FY20, Motilal Oswal expects improvement in VNB margin for ICICI Prudential Life Insurance from the current 17.5 per cent, and the same to be sustained at 24 per cent in case of HDFC Standard Life.
HDFC Asset Management Company’s initial public offer got subscribed a whopping 83 times thanks to robust financial performance and superior brand image/market position. Even though the listing performance will be robust thanks to huge response from investors, it might again see a time correction later on as happened in HDFC Standard Life Insurance. At the upper end of the price band, it is already valued higher at 32 times FY18 earnings/7.8 per cent to FY18 AUM, compared to 26 times/5.6 per cent in case of Reliance Nippon Life AMC.
There are no fresh analyst views on ICICI Securities and ICICI Lombard General Insurance after their listings in April 2018 and September 2017, respectively."
98,2018-08-06,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank raises fixed deposit rates by up to 0.6% 
 Days after the Reserve Bank of India hiked the benchmark repo rate, HDFC Bank today increased fixed deposit rates on various maturities by up to 0.6 per cent. The revised rate of interest is effective today, according to information posted on HDFC Bank’s website.
The increase in fixed deposit rates is likely to put pressure on lending rates as well. The bank has raised the interest rate on term deposits with maturity ranging between 6 months and one day to 5 years. Deposits of a maturity of 6-9 months would earn 6.75 per cent, 40 basis points higher than the previous rate.
The interest rate on fixed deposits of a longer tenure of 9 months three days to less than 1 year has been raised by 60 basis points, while for one year it has been increased by 40 basis points to 7.25 per cent. However, fixed deposits beyond 2 years and 1 day to 5 years will earn 10 basis points more than the previous rate of interest.
RBI last week increased the benchmark short-term lending rate (repo rate) at which it lends to other banks by 0.25 per cent to 6.5 per cent on inflationary concerns. Retail inflation, which is factored in by the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, spiked to a five-month high of 5 per cent in June on costlier fuel.
The government has mandated RBI to keep inflation at 4 per cent (+/- 2 per cent)."
97,2018-08-08,HDFC Bank,"Why the run up in private banks may need watching


The fundamental performance of private sector banks does not mirror the market’s exuberance.




The fundamental performance of private sector banks does not mirror the market’s exuberance.


 It is not unknown that private sector banks—with better earnings visibility and a somewhat more resilient show—have been the darlings of the market in the recent past. In the last one year, while the stock prices of PSU banks have fallen sharply, a few private sector banks have continued their strong run. With too much money chasing too few stocks, valuations of some of the private bank stocks are at historical levels.
But interestingly, the fundamental performance of private sector banks does not mirror the market’s exuberance. For one, over the past four quarters, the core net interest income of private sector banks, has been moderating. Slowing loan growth in some of the larger banks, pressure on margins and sudden shocks on the asset quality front have impacted banks’ core income from lending. Two, bad loans have been creeping up too, leading to higher provisioning, impacting earnings. Three, the rise in government bond yields have led to treasury losses, eating into their core income. All of this has led to profit shrinking on a yearly basis for two consecutive quarters for the entire pack.
Core income moderates
While private banks have managed to grow their loan book through market share gains (as their PSU counterparts consolidate balance sheet), strong retail and SME focus and healthy capital base, the growth in core interest income has slipped. From 16 per cent levels in the June quarter last year, growth in net interest income slowed to 12 per cent in the March quarter. While growth has managed to inch up to 14 per cent in the June quarter, a low base and some one-off recoveries in few banks has helped. Sustainability of the trend needs to be seen.
For HDFC Bank, despite the healthy traction in loans, the growth in the bank’s net interest income has slowed in the last two quarters. From 24 per cent YoY growth in the December 2017 quarter, net interest income grew by a slower 17.7 per cent in the March 2018 quarter and by 15.4 per cent in the latest June quarter. For IndusInd, growth has slowed from 31 per cent levels in June quarter of last year to 20 per cent in the June 2018 quarter. From a robust 30-40 per cent growth last year, net interest income growth moderated to 23 per cent in the latest June quarter for YES Bank.
A consistent moderation in growth, not priced into valuations can weigh on stock prices, if markets turn volatile.
Big daddy banks under pressure
Axis Bank and ICICI Bank—two large private sector banks—have weighed heavily on the performance of the entire pack. Core income growth for these banks has in any case been tepid—at flat to low single-digits. Axis Bank’s net interest income growth that inched up to 12 per cent in the June quarter, has been aided by a one-time impact of interest realisation from recovery on an IBC account.
On the asset quality front, after the one-time hit in the March quarter, on account of the RBI’s diktat on stressed assets, slippages still remain elevated for both Axis and ICICI Bank. For Axis Bank, addition to its stressed assets pool remains a concern. For the rest of the private bank universe too, bad loans have been on the rise over the past four quarters.
YES Bank reported sharp divergences in the September 2017 quarter. There has also been a notable rise in gross slippages in the latest June quarter. IndusInd Bank, had reported bad loan divergences pertaining to 2016-17, in the March quarter.
HDFC Bank too has been reporting additions (though modest when compared to peers) to its bad loan book. While the GNPAs for the bank, in absolute terms, has gone up by 30-40 per cent YoY over the past few quarters, a healthy growth in loans has kept delinquency ratio at bay. 
Hence, the divergence report for FY18 will be a key factor to watch for, to assess the big picture on asset quality for private sector banks.
Overall the profit growth for private sector banks fell sharply from 23 per cent in March 2017 quarter to single digits in the December 2017 quarter. In the March and latest June 2018 quarter, profit has shrunk by 37 per cent and 16 per cent respectively for the entire private bank universe. Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, South Indian Bank, Karur Vysya Bank—all recorded a steep fall in profit in the latest June quarter."

BL Research Bureau
Strong loan growth, marginal improvement in net interest margin and a stable asset quality has kept private lender HDFC Bank’s earnings in good stead in the latest September quarter.
Aside from the good traction in both retail and corporate loans, the bank’s improving cost to income ratio and healthy growth in fee income are key positives. Notably, the pace of growth in the bank’s core net interest income that had moderated in the past two quarters, has witnessed a pick up in the latest September quarter. 
Overall, the bank’s net profit for the quarter has grown by 20.6 per cent year-on-year (YoY), a healthy performance given the ongoing challenges within the sector.
Despite the healthy traction in loans, the growth in the bank’s net interest income had somewhat slowed in the previous quarters. From 24 per cent YoY growth in the December 2017 quarter, net interest income grew by a slower 17.7 per cent in the March 2018 quarter and by 15.4 per cent in the June 2018 quarter. However, in the latest September quarter, HDFC Bank’s net interest income has grown by a higher 20.6 per cent. 
The bank’s net interest margin, after dipping to 4.2 per cent in the June quarter has also inched up to 4.3 per cent in the latest September quarter. 
It has been gaining market share, as PSU banks continue to consolidate their loan book. HDFC Bank has also retained its top slot within the private bank space over the past three years.
The bank’s steady growth in loans over the last several quarters has kept its earnings in good stead. The bank has been growing its loan book by about 20-25 per cent YoY on an average over the last 7-8 quarters. In the latest September quarter too, the bank has delivered 24 per cent YoY growth in domestic loans.
While the gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) for the bank, in absolute terms, has gone up by 30-40 per cent YoY over the past few quarters, a healthy growth in loans has kept delinquency ratio at bay.
HDFC Bank’s GNPAs that had been hovering around the 1 per cent mark in the past, has inched up slightly over the past one year. In the latest September quarter, the bank’s GNPA stood at 1.33 per cent of loans."

Innovation has been driving HDFC Bank’s day-to-day operations for over four years now. In an era where technology is fast changing, HDFC has been ahead of its competition in terms of acknowledging the changes and collaborating with new-age fintech players. Recently, the bank launched an accelerator programme to engage with fintechs at a global level. Talking to BusinessLine, Nitin Chugh, Country Head - Digital Banking, HDFC Bank, dwells on the bank’s recent digital initiatives, and how technology can help bring down NPAs and improve collections. Excerpts:
Collaboration has been the buzz word in the banking industry. How does it help fintechs and big banks like yours?
Banks, obviously, benefit since they get access to new innovations, new ideas and new technologies quickly. It’s not that you can’t think about it, but there is no harm if someone has already thought about it, and you have a way of partnering and implementing it from a bank’s point of view. 
From a fintech’s point of view, most of them are a few years old, and they are also looking at partnership. This will give them access to scale and the experience and knowledge that we have, and that will help them design and change their products accordingly.
How many fintechs have you already worked with?
We started collaborating in 2015 and, back then, everyone thought it wasn’t a good idea to work with fintechs. Now, we have some 30-odd engagements working in various parts of the bank, and we always have a pipeline of around 65-70 at various stages, where somebody is at the proof of concept or ideation stage, testing stage, or planning to go live with their products.
Recently, we partnered with the United Kingdom’s Department for International Trade (UK DIT) and start-up accelerators 91springboard and IvyCamp. We will have more such partnerships, where we will engage with the accelerators globally so that we get access to the start-ups and fintech communities. 
Which areas are heavily dependent on fintech?
A few years ago, you would have found that 40 per cent of fintechs were in payments, 30 per cent on the lending side, and the balance a combination of everything else. Now, if you look at fintechs, most of the interesting works are in areas such as AI, Machine Learning, BlockChain, IoT and VR. 
How has the banking process changed for HDFC since 2015?
Banking at the core doesn’t change; it is same business of borrowing and lending and other transactions. What has changed is the way people bank and what people expect from banks. So, now, no bank can say that they will offer convenience as that is default; you have to give something more than that.
How are you reaching out to customers who are not-so-privileged and do not have access to technology?
We help them understand technology. To give an example, we have something called ‘missed call banking’, for which you don’t need high-end phones. Many customers start with that. A lot of customers start with small-ticket transactions, such as recharge and bill payments. Gradually, once they become comfortable, they begin to use other digital offerings.
What is the base of these customers?
We have about 85 per cent of our transactions that are digital. Every month, about 40 lakh customers carry out transactions via feature phones; and this number continues to grow. In fact, we are building more services on feature phones by using the missed call facility as a backbone. 
Can the issue of NPAs be solved through technology?
I really don’t know how it can also solve the problem of NPAs because that is something very different from what we do in the bank. But, in general, lending can become more judicious (am talking about consumer lending). In general, lending can become more accurate, more predictable, and sharper by the use of technology, which is what we are trying to do.
Is there scope for digitising collections? 
Very much. I can’t tell you exactly what we are doing since that is proprietary. But the ability to forecast the default probability, for instance, becomes very accurate by using the new tech and can help improvise your collection efforts; new tech can help your programme collection efforts or repurpose your collection efforts in a manner that is a little more accurate, and the return on effort is higher."

 Private sector HDFC Bank on Monday said the RBI has approved re-appointment of Aditya Puri as managing director of the bank for another two years.
“Reserve Bank of India, vide its letter dated October 22, 2018, has accorded its approval to HDFC Bank Ltd. for re-appointment of Aditya Puri, as MD & CEO of the bank, from November 1, 2018 to October 26, 2020 (i.e. till the date of his attaining age of 70 years),” the bank said in a filing to stock exchanges. 
Shareholders had already approved his appointment in 2015 for a period of five years subject to RBI approval, it said.
Puri has been with the bank since 1994, making him the longest-serving head of any private bank in the country. During his tenure, Puri has led the bank through two major mergers in the Indian banking industry -- merger of Times Bank Limited and Centurion Bank of Punjab Limited with HDFC Bank."

India Bulls Ventures is the fastest and HDFC Bank is the top wealth creator, says Motilal Oswal study


Watch and jewellery maker Titan Company has ensured consistently good times for its investors, says Motilal Oswal’s 23rd Annual Wealth Creation Study. The stock has been the Most Consistent Wealth Creator, with the highest price CAGR of 33 per cent from 2008 to 2018, followed by Godrej Consumer, Shree Cement and Pidilite with CAGRs of 30 to 33 per cent.
The evergreen HDFC Bank has emerged the biggest wealth creator for the last five years, creating ₹3.2 lakh crore in wealth, followed by Reliance Industries, at ₹3 lakh crore, and TCS at ₹2.5 lakh crore.
But for sheer speed, it has been hard to beat Indiabulls Ventures, the fastest wealth creator over 2013-18 with a whopping 97 per cent CAGR, followed by Dalmia Bharat (81 per cent) and TVS Motors (80 per cent). Motilal Oswal’s annual wealth creation study draws lessons from the top wealth creating companies in the market, after adjusting for corporate events.
So, should investors look to buy the fastest wealth creators, the biggest ones or the most consistent? Raamdeo Agrawal, author of the study and co-founder, Motilal Oswal, told BusinessLine that his preference will be for stocks in the ‘most consistent’ list. “The only problem is that these stocks are usually never available at reasonable valuations. You need to put them on your shopping list and look out for sharp corrections to buy them.”
Agrawal believes that some of the good quality stocks in the financial sector offer good buying opportunities after the recent battering. Financials were the biggest wealth creating sector during 2013-18. The sector has the unusual distinction of featuring the biggest wealth creators (private banks and NBFCs) as well as the biggest wealth destroyers (State-owned banks).
The top 100 stocks have added ₹44.9 lakh crore wealth during 2013-18, the highest ever quantum of wealth created. “During 2013-18, Sensex CAGR was only 12 per cent, but the pace of wealth creation (by these stocks) was healthy at 23 per cent CAGR. This reinforces the point that wealth creation happens in any market conditions. So, investors are better off focussing on the stocks to invest in, rather than timing the markets,” the study adds.
The study this year also offers insights on what’s a good time to buy and sell high-growth stocks. It finds that stocks bought at a price earnings-to-growth ratio (trailing PE ratio divided by forward earnings) of less than 1 offer the best shot at wealth creation. It also finds that companies with scorching profit growth rates often find it hard to sustain this after five to six years. Therefore, investors should look to exit high-growth stocks trading at higher PEG (2 plus).
So, is the market attractive after the recent fall? Agrawal believes that the correction is not done yet. “The market PE is at long-term averages. But history tells us that it needs to go below it to throw up attractive opportunities.” He advises switching from high PE growth stocks to those with less demanding valuations, in the correction."
79,2018-11-06,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank hikes deposit rates; BoB raises lending rate 
Signalling tightening of rates, HDFC Bank on Tuesday raised interest rates on deposits by up to 0.5 per cent for various tenors, while Bank of Baroda hiked lending rates by 0.1 per cent.
In a statement, HDFC Bank said the new rate interest rate on deposits below Rs 1 crore for various tenors will come into effect from Tuesday.
The rate on deposits with tenor of 5-8 years and 8-10 years has been increased to 6.5 per cent from 6 per cent.
The rate has been hiked to 7.25 per cent for fixed deposits of 3-5 years from the earlier 7.1 per cent.
The fixed deposit rate for one-year tenor has been fixed at 7.3 per cent, up from 7.25 per cent.
BoB hikes lending rate by 10 bps
State-owned Bank of Baroda announced a hike in MCLR effective Wednesday.
The interest rate for different categories of borrowers are pegged at the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR).
“MCLR has been reviewed at 10 BPS above existing level w.e.f. November 7, 2018,” the bank said in a statement.
The bank’s one-year MCLR will be 8.65 per cent, which is competitive as per the current market scenario, it said.
For all other tenors -- overnight, one month, three months and six months -- rates are 8.15 per cent, 8.20 per cent, 8.30 per cent and 8.50 per cent, respectively.
The bank further said it does not add any mark-up on its MCLR for its best-rated home loan borrowers.
One-year MCLR, that is 8.65 per cent, is applicable irrespective of the total home loan amount and is available for a tenure of up to 30 years, it added.
The Reserve Bank of India will be announcing its next bi-monthly monetary policy in the first week of December."

After a period of continuous disruptions, with several senior management changes over the last three to four years, Infosys (₹662) is set for a reasonably smooth digital ride. With a new CEO, the focus on growth seems to have returned for Infosys.
A rapidly expanding digital services business, healthy large-sized deal wins and solid traction in key verticals are positives for the company.
At the current price, the stock trades at a reasonable 16 times its likely per share earnings for FY20. The company’s PE multiples have hovered around 18-19 times over the past three years. Despite rallying more than 40 per cent over the past one year, the shares of Infosys still appear to be attractive for investors with a two-to three-year horizon.
There is considerable valuation comfort, with underlying earnings growth likely to take an upward trajectory over the next few years, more so as the rupee remains weak against the dollar.
In the first half of FY19, Infosys’ revenues grew by 14.7 per cent to ₹39,737 crore, while net profits rose by 7.1 per cent to ₹7,721 crore. The company’s revenues have grown at a compounded annual rate of 9.8 per cent between FY15 and FY18.
As clients increasingly demand automation of normal application services and look at increasing spends on advanced technologies, Infosys upped the focus on its digital offerings significantly. The digital business accounted for 31 per cent of the company’s revenues in the September quarter, up from 25 per cent in the same period last year. In fact, revenues from digital services have been growing in double-digits even on a sequential basis for the past four to six quarters.
The financial services vertical has picked up pace in the last few quarters, while retail and manufacturing have steadily increased contribution to revenues over the past one year.
Thanks to elevated oil prices, and the resultant increase in capex spends of clients in the space, the energy and utilities vertical has rebounded well too. These segments together contribute more than 70 per cent of Infosys’ revenues, indicating broad-based growth for the company. Over the last one year, the company has added four new clients in the $100-million bucket; three in the $50-million category and as many as 19 customers in the $10-million bracket.
In fact, in the recent September quarter, the company signed $2-billion of large-deals.

Hindustan Unilever has lost 12 per cent so far from its one-year high of ₹1,808 touched in end-August 2018. While it may still look a bit pricey trading at 60 times its trailing 12-month earnings, a solid recovery in consumption, post-demonetisation and GST move, a stronghold in the rural market (40 per cent of sales) — which is growing faster than the urban segment — and a diversified product portfolio with market leadership in several categories make HUL (₹1,633) a good long-term bet. Investors can take exposure to the stock now and also accumulate on any further dips due to market volatility.
Consumption has posted a convincing comeback after derailing due to demonetisation and GST. After recording a flat (year-on-year) growth in domestic volumes in the June 2017 quarter due to the GST transition, HUL’s volumes have gained traction, growing 10-12 per cent in each of the quarters beginning October to December 2017.
Superior product mix, as well as price increases to pass on rise in input prices, have helped the company record a price/mix led growth of 4-6 per cent over the last few quarters. Profit growth in these periods has also been strong, at 14-27 per cent in each of the last four quarters. All segments of the company — be it home care, beauty and personal care or food and refreshments — have more or less been contributing equally to the strong show.
In the near to medium term, while rising interest rates and a tight liquidity situation among lenders may dampen discretionary consumption to an extent, consumer non-durables may continue to do well.
HUL, with its wide reach as well as differentiated products across price points will be a beneficiary. Going forward, increasing consumer preference for premium products as well as the company’s pricing power to pass on any cost increases will drive improvement in realisations and margins. For the next leg of growth, HUL is focusing on widening the reach of products in under-penetrated categories in hair/personal care.
Towards expanding the market for its ‘naturals’ portfolio, the company is following a three-pronged strategy of introducing natural variants in its existing brands, building a bouquet of natural products under the ‘Lever Ayush’ brand and also building specialist natural brands such as Indulekha.

The stock of Titan Company (₹871), is a good long-term buy for your portfolio. Continued growth in market share in the jewellery segment, launches across product segments and the success of its gold savings and gold exchange schemes that bring new customers, are reasons behind the stronger-than-industry-average growth.
While the last few years have been challenging for the gems and jewellery industry with new regulations and higher import duty on gold which hit consumer sentiments, Titan has managed a decent show. Between 2013-14 and 2017-18, the company recorded revenue growth of 9 per cent and net profit growth of 12 per cent (CAGR). Operating margins of the jewellery and watches segments have improved, thanks to better product mix and cost-cutting. In the jewellery segment, EBIT margins were 9-10 per cent in 2015-16; they now stand at 11-13 per cent.
Revenue growth is likely to be higher over the next five years, given the GST-led push to shift in consumer demand from the unorganised to branded jewellers,
Higher import duties, if any, may not significantly impact Titan, as its gold exchange scheme is working well. The company sources a chunk of its requirement from old gold that customers bring for exchange.
While the Q1 2018-19 performance was not good , stronger-than-expected revenue growth is expected in Q2. The company, in its Q2 preview, reported that growth in the jewellery segment was good, despite headwinds, including higher gold prices, weak consumer sentiment and fewer wedding dates. Higher sales of diamond jewellery and launch of new collections in studded gold jewellery and silver were reasons for the healthy growth. The watches segment continued to see good momentum in the quarter, led by new products across affordable, work and fashion categories.
The stock has corrected from ₹1,000 in April. At current levels, the stock discounts its estimated earnings for 2019-20 by 40 times. It was trading at 53 times, its one-year forward earnings, a year back.

The Reliance Industries (₹1,074) juggernaut seems set to roll on, with the company firing on multiple cylinders. Its financial performance has been consistently healthy with profit growth of 19 per cent in 2016-17, 20 per cent in 2017-18 and 18 per cent Y-o-Y in the half-year ended September 2018. This has been driven by the massive investments made by the company in its mainstay hydrocarbon businesses — refining and petrochemicals — and in its new-age consumer businesses – digital (RJio) and retail. Strong growth in these segments has more than offset the decline in fortunes in the oil and gas exploration business that has shrunk sharply due to declining volumes.
RIL should continue to do well in the years ahead, thanks to its deep coffers and execution capabilities that allow it to invest big, achieve massive scale, and dominate industries. A diversified presence across businesses hedges risk. The mega investment phase in its hydrocarbon segments seems to be plateauing, for now. But growth in these cyclical businesses should remain healthy with the commissioning of some new facilities in the quarters ahead and also due to regulatory benefits such as fuel specification changes by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).
Meanwhile, RIL continues to invest aggressively in the retail and digital businesses, which are likely to keep growing rapidly. This is in line with the company’s plan to grow the profits of the consumer businesses to the extent of the hydrocarbon businesses; currently, the consumer businesses contribute about a quarter of total operating profits. Addition of retail stores and telecom subscribers are likely to continue at a brisk pace. Organic growth is being supplemented through strategic acquisitions. Listing of the digital and retail businesses sometime in the future could mean significant value unlocking for RIL shareholders. Investors with a long-term perspective can buy the stock.
The RIL stock made a roaring comeback from February 2017, more than doubling until August this year. But since then, the stock has lost about 20 per cent, largely due to the ongoing market weakness. This provides an entry point for long-term investors. The stock now trades at about 16.5 times the trailing 12-month earnings, lower than the average 17 times over the past year.

Amid the persisting challenges in the banking sector, HDFC Bank (₹1,947) has managed to put up a good show over the past few years, even as its peers have been weighed down by asset quality issues.
Strong loan growth, steady net interest margin and a stable asset quality have kept the private lender’s earnings in good stead.
HDFC Bank, the largest private bank, has been steadily growing its loan book by about 20-25 per cent (year-on-year) on an average over the last seven to eight quarters. It has been gaining market share, as public sector banks continue to consolidate their loan books. HDFC Bank has also retained its top slot within the private bank space over the past three years.
At the current price, the stock trades at about 3.1 times its one-year forward book value, lower than its three-year average of 3.4 times.
This offers long-term investors a good opportunity to buy the stock at the current levels, given that the bank’s earnings are likely to grow by 18-20 per cent over the next two years. The bank’s recent September quarter performance has also been noteworthy.
It delivered 24 per cent Y-o-Y growth in domestic loans in the September quarter, led by good traction in both retail and corporate loans. Notably, the pace of growth in the bank’s core net interest income that had moderated in the past two quarters, has witnessed a pick up in the latest September quarter.
From 17.7 per cent Y-o-Y growth in the March quarter, net interest income grew by a slower 15.4 per cent in the June quarter.
However, in the latest September quarter, HDFC Bank’s net interest income grew by a higher 20.6 per cent. Overall, the bank’s net profit for the quarter has grown by 20.6 per cent Y-o-Y, a healthy performance, given the ongoing challenges within the sector.
HDFC Bank’s GNPAs that had been hovering around the 1 per cent mark in the past, has inched up slightly over the past one year. In the latest September quarter, the bank’s GNPA stood at 1.33 per cent of loans."
78,2018-11-20,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank plans to buy CCIL stake
HDFC Bank said on Tuesday that it has plans to acquire 4 per cent stake in Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL) from Bank of Baroda. The acquisition for about ₹124 crore is likely to be completed by end of December. “The bank currently holds 5 per cent of the total equity capital of CCIL. Hence, it is proposed to increase the stake in CCIL to 9 per cent from the current 5 per cent from an investment perspective,” the lender said in a regulatory filing. Prior approval of the RBI is required for the transaction, it said."
77,2018-11-27,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank rolls out next-gen banking app
HDFC Bank unveiled its next-gen mobile banking app that offers users effortless access to their bank accounts on the go. The next-gen app allows customers to bank the way that they live.
The launch of this new mobile banking app should be seen as a “first big step” in the bank’s omni-channel strategy and its journey towards transforming itself into a lifestyle bank from a life cycle-focussed bank, Nitin Chugh, Country Head- Digital Banking, HDFC Bank, told BusinessLine.
Chugh said the new platform has been developed in partnership with Dutch-based Backbase, a globally renowned fintech software provider that empowers financial institutions to accelerate their digital transformation.
This new app, which is available in both Android and iOS devices – has a simple, intuitive navigation, and incorporates features such as biometric log-in for enhanced security and access. It also eliminates all financial and technical jargon for users by grouping transactions into three easy-to-understand categories – pay, save and invest.
The new banking app was launched at the bank’s annual Digital Innovation Summit 2018 (DIS) in New Delhi. The Digital Innovation Summit is a marquee event for the bank to showcase and launch innovative products and services that ride on technology."
76,2018-11-29,HDFC Bank,"‘Challenges in the NBFC sector remain largely resolved’
Challenges in the NBFC sector seem to have been largely resolved and the entire system is showing maturity in dealing with it, believes Kaizad Bharucha, Executive Director, HDFC Bank. The bank’s wholesale loan book touched ₹3.5 lakh crore at the end of September 30, 2018, from ₹2.85 lakh crore in March this year.
In an interview with BusinessLine, Bharucha, who handles the wholesale banking division at HDFC Bank, also spoke about the private sector lender’s strategy on lending and keeping non-performing assets under control. Excerpts:
What is your view on the current crisis in the NBFC sector?
The current incident that we had realted to one NBFC did create ripples, but it would be incorrect to say that it is a sectoral or systemic issue. The challenges that arose in the sector in the last couple of months have largely been resolved. Some of the data points suggest a lot of NBFCs have been able to meet their payment obligations, and have been able to raise fresh liabilities once gain. The larger part of the issue is addressed. There may be some component, which will sort itself out in the next few weeks.
Has the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code been helpful to banks? Are there concerns about delays in resolution?
I believe it is an important legislation, which will go a long way in bringing comfort to the banking system. It puts a time frame around the resolution of the asset, and looks to resolve the asset rather than only liquidate it for recovery.
It also brings a lot of transparency for the stakeholders and the process involved. It also tells the borrowers that if they do not conduct themselves in the expected manner in a defined time frame, then they would risk losing the the ownership and control of the company. This is very important, as earlier it would take a very long time to achieve dispossessing a change in management. On the issue of delays, I think we need to allow the legislation and the process to settle down.
There have already been a fair amount of resolutions, though all of them don’t get the mileage or the visibility.
How did the bank grow its wholesale loan book, especially with many lendersbecoming cautious on lending?
It goes back to how we do our business in wholesale; there is a clear identified target market, we bring in a complete bouquet of products – not just working capital but term and project loans – as well as the entire supply chain and vendor financing.
The engagement that we have with the customer and a prudent approach have ensured that we try and avoid the pitfalls.
How has HDFC Bank  kept NPAs low?
We look at the standing of the company; we look at the quality of management as well as the cash flows and the entire diligence done both by business and credit, as we deliver credit to the customer in terms of credit lines.
We have always had a model since inception where business and credit form separate verticals. This acts as a very good architecture to manage the risk-reward relationship and maintain asset quality. It is coupled with good monitoring process.
What is your expectation when it comes  to interest rates?
We have seen an increase in interest rates over the last several months. Looking at various parameters, we are directionally in an interest rate scenario, which will rise.
However, the exact timing of the rise will be data and event-dependent. US dollar and rupee will continue to remain volatile. It will be in a range of ₹1.5-1.75 either way from where it is, though I am not a treasury person.
It won’t swing off in the short term, but will be range bound."
75,2018-12-03,HDFC Bank,"After glitch, HDFC Bank to restore older version of app 


With customers troubled by snags in its new mobile banking application (app), private sector lender HDFC Bank has decided to restore the old app by Tuesday-end.
“This is to prevent inconvenience to customers. It will be available for download and use by 5pm on December 4,” said HDFC Bank on Monday, adding that it will be available both on Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
“The new app, since it is taking us longer to fix than anticipated, is being pulled down from the App Store and Play Store till further notice,” it further said.
HDFC Bank had, on November 27, launched the next-gen mobile banking app, which had features such as biometric log-in with fingerprint and facial recognition for iPhone X users.
However, on November 29, the bank apologised for the inconvenience that many users faced in logging onto the new app.
Sources said the bank’s technical team is still trying to identify the problem, but it could have possibly been due to high traffic, leading to some kind of a snag."

73,2018-12-11,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank drops to over 2-week low
Private-sector lender HDFC Bank's shares fell as much as 2.7 per cent to Rs 2,032, lowest since November 26.
The stock has broken below a support at Rs 2,064.95, the 14.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the uptrend from November 25, 2016 low to July 18, 2018 high (wave(3)). The stock's wave pattern suggests it is in the final wave C of the correction that started from July 18.
In the near term, the stock has support at its 50-day exponential moving average and at 2,014.05 rupees, the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci projection level of wave A. However, the current wave has the potential of falling up to Rs 1,807.
MACD has cut below its signal line, a bearish sign. HDFC Bank stock had gone up 11.6 per cent this year as of last close, while the broader NSE Index was down 0.4 pct in the same period."
72,2019-01-08,HDFC Bank,"Gruh-Bandhan Bank merger will benefit both entities: HDFC chief


Keki Mistry, Vice-Chairman, HDFC




Keki Mistry, Vice-Chairman, HDFC




Upbeat about the merger of Gruh Finance with Bandhan Bank, Keki Mistry, Vice-Chairman, HDFC, said there is synergy between the two entities and the move will be beneficial to both companies. In an interview with BusinessLine, he said HDFC will continue to focus on its own set of priorities and that nothing will change after the merger. Excerpts:
How will the merger with Bandhan Bank help Gruh Finance? 
We saw that there is a fair amount of synergy between the merger of Bandhan Bank and Gruh, as it creates a platform for rural and semi-urban lending. Also, we will benefit from the fact that Gruh now has access to lower cost funding from the bank, and access to a much larger lending platform compared to what it had by itself. Bandhan Bank will have access to Gruh’s operating systems, which have been time-tested over the years, as well as its expertise in housing loans. It will also benefit through the large presence in Western India, which Bandhan, by itself, did not have.
Will HDFC now focus on affordable housing and compete with Gruh?
 We do affordable housing even now, and nothing will change after the merger. We will continue to do what we are doing, and that will be HDFC’s focus. During the half-year ended September 30, 2018, 37 per cent of the home loans approved by HDFC in number and 18 per cent of the loans in value terms were to the economically weaker section, or lower income group. 
What is your view on the economy and growth prospects? 
I am very optimistic about India’s growth for a variety of reasons. The reforms that have been taking place over the years, particularly in the last couple of years, are now beginning to take shape. In the real estate sector various reforms have been initiated, such as the RERA Act, a host of benefits of the credit-linked subsidy scheme, and fiscal incentives provided for housing loans.
Do you think there has been a revival of private investment and corporate credit demand?
Private investment started seeing a pick-up a few months ago. I haven’t seen the data for the last one or two months, but to my mind, there has been pick-up in private investments. When it comes to credit demand, I think there is a lot of demand for housing. 
I don’t want to comment on numbers as we have results coming up, but the demand is definitely there.
Have the liquidity issues in the NBFC sector been addressed?
It has been significantly resolved, in my view. At HDFC, we never faced liquidity issue at all because we have very diversified sources of funding – we raise money through deposits, term loans, bonds, international funding, ECBs, and masala bonds. We just went to the Japanese market and raised $470 million. I think the liquidity issue in the system has broadly been addressed."

70,2019-01-19,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank Q3 net profit up 20% at Rs 5,586 cr 


Led by a steady increase in income, private sector lender HDFC Bank on Saturday reported a 20.31 per cent rise in its net profit at Rs 5,585.9 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.
The bank, which is the largest private sector lender, had a net profit of Rs 4,642.60 crore in the third quarter in the last fiscal.
The bank’s total income for the October to December 2018 quarter grew by 26 per cent to Rs 30,811.3 crore from Rs 24,450.4 crore in the same period a year ago.
Net interest income (interest earned less interest expended) for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 grew by 21.9 per cent to Rs 12,576.8 crore as compared to Rs 10,314.3 crore in the same period a year ago. “This was driven by asset growth of 23.7 per cent and a core net interest margin for the quarter of 4.3 per cent,” HDFC Bank said in a release.
Other income or non-interest revenue also grew by a robust 27.2 per cent to Rs 4,921.0 crore in the third quarter of the fiscal, compared to Rs 3,869.2 crore in the corresponding quarter ended December 31, 2017.
Asset quality remained stable and gross NPAs were marginally higher at 1.38 per cent of gross assets as on December 31, 2018, as against 1.29 per cent a year ago. Net NPAs amounted to 0.42 per cent of net advances as on December 31, 2018, compared to 0.44 per cent a year ago.
The bank’s provisions for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 were Rs 2,211.5 crore (consisting of specific loan loss provision of Rs 1,734.6 crore and general and other provisions of Rs 476.9 crore) as against Rs 1,351.4 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
Provisions for the third quarter this fiscal included a charge of Rs 322.4 crore towards contingent provisions.
“There was no divergence observed by RBI for the financial year ended March 31, 2018 in respect of the bank's asset classification and provisioning under the extant prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning pertaining to advances,” HDFC Bank said in a regulatory filing.
Total advances as of December 31, 2018 were Rs 780,951 crore. Domestic advances grew by 24.1 per cent over December 31, 2017. Total deposits as of December 31, 2018 were Rs 852,502 crore, registering an increase of 22 per cent over December 31, 2017."
69,2019-01-21,HDFC Bank,"Shares of HDFC Bank jump nearly 2% post Q3 results
 Shares of HDFC Bank jumped nearly 2 per cent after the private sector lender reported 20 per cent rise in net profit in December 2018 quarter.
 The private sector lender on Saturday reported 20.3 per cent growth in net profit to Rs 5,585.9 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, mainly on account of higher net interest income.
 The bank had posted a net profit of Rs 4,642.6 crore in the October-December quarter of 2017-18.
 Shares of HDFC Bank opened at Rs 2,149, then surged further to Rs 2,165, registering a jump of 1.58 per cent over its last close.
 Similar movement was seen on NSE, where the stock opened at Rs 2,139.95, then touched an intra-day high of Rs 2,166.50, up 1.70 per cent over its previous closing price.
 During the reported quarter, total income of the lender rose to Rs 30,811.27 crore from Rs 24,450.44 crore in the year-ago period.
“In December quarter 2018-19, HDFC Bank’s operating profit was in line with our expectations, while bottom line was below our expectations by 5 per cent on account of higher provisions,” Elara Capital said in a research note adding that the company’s asset quality continues to remain robust except for some concerns in agri portfolio.
 Net interest income (interest earned less interest expended) for the reported quarter grew 21.9 per cent to Rs 12,576.8 crore from Rs 10,314.3 crore in the year-ago period, driven by asset growth of 23.7 per cent and a core net interest margin of 4.3 per cent for the quarter, it said.
 During the quarter, the bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose to 1.38 per cent of the total advances, compared with 1.29 per cent at the end of the third quarter of 2017-18.
 Net NPAs of the bank declined to 0.42 per cent of the assets in October-December 2018, against 0.44 per cent a year ago."

 Realty firm Rustomjee will invest about ₹3,000 crore over the next four years on construction of its new luxury housing project in South Mumbai.
Rustomjee is expecting a sales revenue of ₹5,800 crore from this 5.75 acre project, which is being developed in a join venture with the land owner, its Chief Managing Director (CMD) Boman R Irani said.
The company has tied up with HDFC for funding of this project and construction work will be done by L&T.
“We have launched a luxurious project ‘Rustomjee Crown’ located in Prabhadevi, Mumbai. We will develop about 700 units in this project,” he said.
Irani said the majority of the units would be sold in a price range of ₹8-14 crore, while some units would cost about ₹18-20 crore.
The project has been conceptualized by renowned architect Hafeez Contractor and designed by Bangkok’s leading interior design firm PIA Interiors.
Irani said apartments in this project are ranging from 1,335—2,528 sq ft (carpet area) overlooking the Arabian Sea.
Asked about the investment, he said the construction and licensing cost is estimated at around ₹3,000 crore.
Irani said the project’s USP is 2.52 acre open to sky lush tropical podium landscape.
Commenting on the association, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh, “HDFC Ltd is the strategic finance partner for Rustomjee Crown and we are confident this project will redefine the way homes and living spaces are imagined in this part of the city“.
Rustomjee has 12.5 million square feet of completed projects; 15 million square feet of ongoing development and another 30 million square feet of planned development in the pipeline, spanning across the best locations of Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR)."
67,2019-01-31,HDFC Bank,"Banking sector to adopt AI solutions to improve operational efficiency 
 The banking and financial services sector will see the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in the days ahead, to make internal operations efficient and the customer experience more effective. 
India's largest private sector bank, HDFC Bank, is looking at disruptive technologies from start-ups in the FinTech space. Launching the fourth edition of the Digital Innovation Summit in Ahmedabad on Thursday, Nitin Chug, country head - digital banking, HDFC Bank, said Artificial Intelligence (AI) would be the most prominent technology driver for the banking sector in the coming days. 
""Banks have increasingly started engaging with the start-up community to bring about effective fintech solutions. These are not merely aimed at customer experience, but are also aimed at the banks' own internal operations. AI is the most prominent technology available at present. Once embedded (into the systems) they could alter a lot of processes in all organisations, not just banks,"" Chug said during the launch. 
From the technology intervention point of view, HDFC Bank has emphasised on experience, which, according to Chug, can be delivered on five things.
""Technology that gives a personalised experience, real-time services, relates with customers, and which is contextual and responsive so as to be quickly adopted. We are moving in this direction, to align ourselves with it,"" he added. 
The bank is already witnessing a rapid transition from offline to digital transactions. About 85 per cent of the transactions that take place for HDFC Bank are currently done through the digital mode. This represents a quantum jump from 45 per cent about five years ago. 
""Mobile transactions have seen rapid growth since we launched a mobile app campaign in 2014. The share of mobile transactions is greater than net banking. We have seen this shift mostly in the past two years,"" said Chug.
The summit provides a platform for start-ups to showcase their innovations, aimed at powering the bank’s next phase of growth. Started in 2016, the earlier three editions were held in Mumbai and Delhi. 
At the day-long summit held at the Centre for Innovation Incubation & Entrepreneurship (CIIE), IIM-Ahmedabad, 24 start-ups shortlisted from 151 applications presented their ideas to a jury comprising HDFC Bank’s top management, representatives of CIIE, and 91springboard - a community resource agency. A total of three winners will be given a chance to deploy their solutions in HDFC Bank.
The innovations have been in the areas of AI, machine learning (ML), analytics, and robotic process automation, among others. 
The bank aims to help these start-ups bring out a consumer-ready product. It will use its domain expertise to mentor start-ups on customer experience, reduce time-to-market and costs, among other domains. In turn, entrepreneurs will be able to use the bank’s platform to test their ideas in the real world and expert insights.
“The objective of the Digital Innovation Summit in Gujarat is to have at its disposal a pool of cutting-edge world technology solutions,"" Chug said. 
The innovative ideas will be introduced in areas such as Mobile Banking, Customer Experience, Cyber Security, Social Banking, Payments, Branch Automation, and Operational Efficiency."

65,2019-02-18,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank has no plans to cut down on branch expansion: MD
The country’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank does not plan to cut down on its branch expansion plan, said its Managing Director Aditya Puri.
“Absolutely not,” said Puri, when asked if the lender would cut branches in future. He added that the bank will give a choice to customers, who can transact either through mobile phone or laptop or visit a branch.
His comments come at a time when a number of global banks are adopting a digital-centric approach. Significantly, HDFC Bank also opened its 5,000th branch in Andheri, which was inaugurated by Puri.
“This branch was launched on the same day that it commenced operations in 1995, marking the start of its 25th year,” HDFC Bank said in a statement. The first branch was launched in Mumbai at Sandoz House, Worli.
“Going forward, we will continue our effort to not just take banking to every part of the country but also to make a difference to the society,” said Puri.
HDFC Bank had secured its banking licence in January 1995, and had opened its first corporate office and branch the following month.
Puri also added that HDFC Bank is targeting to take its services to one lakh villages."
64,2019-02-18,HDFC Bank,"No plans to cut down branch expansion: HDFC Bank chief
 Largest domestic lender from the private sector space, HDFC Bank, does not intend to cut down on branch expansion, a top official said on Monday.
It can be noted many banks globally are focusing on technology more than the physical presence in recent times.
“Absolutely not,” HDFC Bank’s managing director and chief executive Aditya Puri replied, when asked if the lender will be cutting branches in the future.
He said the bank will give a choice to the customers, who can transact either through mobile phone or a laptop or visit a branch.
India is the fastest growing major economy in the world and banking services are yet to reach all the people, Puri added.
The bank is targeting to take its services to 1 lakh villages, Puri said without specifying a timeline or the number of places it reaches as of now.
Global lenders’ call on cutting down on physical presence has also had an impact in India, with decisions like HSBC’s call to halve its branch presence in the country or Standard Chartered cutting down on at least 500 jobs.
Opens 5,000th branch 
Puri was speaking on the sidelines of the bank’s 5,000th branch opening in suburban Andheri. The bank has also entered the 25th year of its operations in the country.
Puri, who has been heading the bank since its formation, said it is a nostalgic and emotional moment and added that it has seen India change in the last quarter century.
He said the bank has benefited from India’s growth and also contributes for social change with over half its network in rural and semi-urban areas.
When asked about the future, Puri said the best is yet to come for the bank."

Private sector lender HDFC Bank has relaunched the upgraded version of its mobile banking application (app), which was pulled down weeks after its launch in November.
“Customers can install the new version of the app, which is available on both Google Play Store and Apple App Store,” said a person familiar with the development.
HDFC Bank did not respond to an e-mail query sent by BusinessLine. The private sector lender had launched the next-gen mobile banking app with over 120 transactions and features such as biometric login on November 27 last year, but withdrew it after many users complained of malfunction while logging in.
It had restored the older version of the app and had said that customers who had deleted the older version in order to install the new version would not be able to use the app till further notice.
This time around, the relaunch of the upgraded app has been on a quieter and cautious note. In November, the app was launched at the bank’s annual Digital Innovation Summit 2018 in New Delhi.
However, sources said that during the review, no bugs or security problems were found.
“It seems to have been more of a pipeline problem as no one anticipated the number of people who would download the app,” said the person.
The private sector lender is understood to be keeping a close watch on the app, although there has been no large-scale problem till now.
As on September 30, 2018, HDFC bank had 4.3 crore customers. Its mobile and internet banking reach had expanded from just 3 per cent of its customer base in 2008 to 85 per cent in 2018.
The HDFC Bank scrip gained 0.44 per cent and closed at ₹2,261.45 apiece on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)."

BL Research Bureau
After delivering sub-20 per cent loan growth in the previous two fiscals, HDFC Bank managed a higher 24 per cent loan growth in the FY19 fiscal. But the bank’s retail loan portfolio that had been driving growth over the past two years, has seen a considerable slowdown in growth, owing to the underlying weakness in the four/two wheeler segments. Nonetheless, backed by strong uptick in corporate loan growth, a stable net interest margin, improving cost to income ratio, and healthy growth in fee income, earnings for the bank has grown at a steady 20.5 per cent year-on-year (YoY) in FY19.
Corporate loans drive growth
For HDFC Bank, retail loans have been a key driver of growth in the previous two fiscal years. But significant slowdown in growth across most segments---in particular auto, two wheeler, business banking and Kisan Gold Cards—has impacted retail loan growth in FY19.
After reporting a robust 27 per cent growth in FY16, overall loan growth moderated to 18-19 per cent levels in FY17 and FY18. Lower traction in corporate loans in FY17, had impacted loan growth--- in particular, in the December 2016 quarter HDFC Bank’s corporate loan growth was impacted by the unwinding of the leveraged product the bank offered under the FCNR deposit scheme as well as repayment of some of the working capital loans by SMEs, post demonetisation. While normalisation of some of these events, helped corporate loan pick up in the March 2017 quarter, loan growth for the full fiscal (FY17) had moderated to 19 per cent.
Read: HDFC Bank Q4 net profit up 23 per cent at Rs 5,885 crore
In FY18, corporate loans grew by a more modest 9 per cent. That said, growth in retail loans in FY17 and FY18 continued on a strong wicket, driving the overall growth for the bank.
In FY19, while retail loan growth has moderated, notable pick up in corporate loan growth has helped deliver a strong overall loan growth of 24 per cent. As a result retail loans now constitute 54 per cent of the overall loan portfolio (from 57 per cent in FY18).
While net interest margins have remained stable at 4.2-4.3 per cent, a drop in cost to income ratio and strong fee income growth have boosted the core performance of the bank in FY19.
Bad loans marginally up
Since FY17, gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) for the bank, in absolute terms, has been growing 30-40 per cent YoY. However a healthy growth in loans has kept delinquency ratio (GNPA as a per cent of loans) at bay. But the bank has been facing stress in its Agri portfolio, which may need a watch. That said, a higher provision coverage ratio of 71 per cent (floating provisions of Rs 1451 crore) mitigate risk. HDFC Bank’s GNPAs that had been hovering around the 1 per cent mark, in the past, has inched up slightly over the past one year. In the latest March quarter, the bank’s GNPA stood at 1.36 per cent of loans."

CMP: ₹1,955.05

In Q4FY19, HDFC Bank posted in-line core lending operational performance (NII), but core fee income was below our expectations, leading to lower PPoP and net profit. Lower credit cost aids net profit q-o-q. Equation among LCR (liquidity coverage ratio), LDR (loan-to-deposit ratio) and NIM show required reduction in cost. Credit and investments (as a percentage of deposit and borrowings) were at 80 per cent and 28 per cent respectively; drop in these ratios by about 100 bps each q-o-q, a rise in cash ratio (as a per cent of deposit & borrowings) by 200 bps and a slight fall in LCR to 118 per cent (from 120 per cent) show limited scope for LDR expansion.

HDFC Bank board nod for share-split 


The board of directors of HDFC Bank, on Wednesday, approved a proposal to split the lender’s share from one equity share of face value of ₹2 each to two shares of face value ₹1 each.
“Owing to the bank’s strong financial performance and sound asset quality, the market price of the bank’s equity shares has grown steadily over the past several years,” HDFC Bank said in a regulatory filing, adding that the stock split will augment the affordability of the bank’s equity shares and participation of retail and individual investors.
“This will thereby facilitate more liquidity in the bank’s equity shares, sub-division of the equity shares is proposed,” it said. 
 The proposal will now be approved by the bank’s shareholders in the annual general meeting (AGM) on June 12, and the stock split will be completed three to four months after that. After the sub-division, the lender’s authorised share capital will be ₹650 crore divided into 650 crore fully paid-up equity shares of ₹1 each from the current 325 crore equity shares of ₹2 each.
HDFC Bank, the country’s largest private sector lender, had last split its shares in 2011 in a ratio of 1:5, or one share of ₹10 split into five shares of ₹2 each.
The AGM will also decide on the proposed dividend ₹15 per equity share recommended by the board at its earlier meeting on April 20.

 The ball is clearly in the RBI’s court. The regulator needs to decide soon on whether it will allow the re-appointment of the chiefs of private sector lenders IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank.
IndusInd Bank MD and CEO Romesh Sobti and HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri will both turn 70 next year, and retire in March and October 2020, respectively. They will not be eligible for re-appointment based on current RBI norms.
“The benchmark will be what happens in IndusInd Bank’s case. If the RBI agrees to Sobti’s re-appointment, then HDFC Bank could also send a similar proposal,” said a person familiar with the development.
Sources said initial feelers have been sent to the RBI for a possible exception to the rule though a formal proposal is yet to be sent. The banks may also engage in formal discussions in the course of this year.
In response to an email query by BusinessLine, IndusInd Bank said: “We do not wish to comment as the matter is speculative.” HDFC Bank, in its response, said: “Our stand on succession is in the public domain, and we wouldn’t like to add to it. Suffice to say that we have an appropriate succession plan in place.” 
With the RBI cracking the whip on private sector lenders such as Axis Bank and YES Bank, which have seen top-level changes, it is unclear whether it will relax its norms for IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank. 
Bankers have pointed out that private companies, unlike banks, can continue to have directors over the age of 70. Experts also believe that exceptions should be made for good performers. 
“Age is just a number. If a person is performing well then he/she should be allowed to continue in the role,” observed JN Gupta, MD, Stakeholder Empowerment Services. “However, succession planning is crucial for an organisation and it should be prepared for the exit of the CEO at any time.” 
Ashvin Parekh, Managing Partner at Ashvin Parekh Advisory, agreed. “Capability and age are not bound to each other. If a person has the ability to lead, he should be allowed to continue post the age of 70.”
Significantly, the RBI, in October 2018, had approved the re-appointment of Puri as MD and CEO for two years though the shareholders had approved it for five years.
Both Sobti and Puri are veteran bankers. Sobti recently expressed his keenness to continue if the RBI allows it. HDFC Bank has remained silent on the issue although Puri, in an analyst call last year, had said the process of appointing a successor would begin 18-24 months before his retirement."

 Mortgage lender HDFC has put up crisis-hit Jet Airways’ office space for sale with a reserve price of Rs 245 crore, as part of efforts to recover outstanding dues. Jet Airways, which temporarily shut operations on April 17, owes around Rs 414 crore to HDFC. “The borrower (Jet Airways) has failed to repay the amount (Rs 414.80 crore) due to HDFC Ltd. Accordingly, HDFC Ltd has become entitled to enforce its mortgage over the immovable property,” it said in a public notice.
The office, spread over 52,775 square feet carpet area, in Mumbai’s suburban financial centre Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), is on the fourth floor of the building ‘Jet Airways Godrej BKC’. The e-auction of the office, with a reserve price of Rs 245 crore, is scheduled for May 15, according to the public notice.
The distressed airline, which had more than 120 planes in its fleet, has been grappling with financial woes. The full service carrier has defaulted on various payments, including salaries to employees. As part of a resolution plan, State Bank of India-led consortium of domestic lenders have sought bids for stake sale in the airline.
Four entities - Etihad Airways, TPG Capital, Indigo Partners and National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) - are learnt to have shown interest in picking up stake in Jet Airways. The details of the bidders are expected to be known on Friday.
Earlier this week, a grouping of Jet Airways’ pilots moved the Supreme Court seeking direction to the SBI to provide the assured interim finance for restarting operations. The petition filed by the National Aviators’ Guild has also sought a direction to the Centre and the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to disallow slots of Jet Airways to other airlines on the permanent basis.

Private sector lender HDFC Bank has said that the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the board will soon set up a search committee to scout for potential successors to its current Managing Director and CEO, Aditya Puri.
“The bank’s Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) also oversees matters of succession planning of its directors, senior management, and key executives...With respect to the tenure of the current Managing Director ending in October 2020, the board will identify a successor and work to ensure that this is done in a manner that will allow appropriate time for an effective transition of responsibilities,” it said in its annual report 2018-19.
The NRC will constitute a search committee to undertake a global search of both internal and external candidates, it further said.
The annual report will be presented to shareholders at the private sector lender’s 25th annual general meeting on July 12. Puri, who has been associated with HDFC Bank since 1994, will retire in October 2020 on attaining the age of 70 years.
The annual report said the performance bonus of top management for 2017-18 is yet to be cleared by the RBI.
Meanwhile, the AGM will also take up for approval board-level appointments. These include the appointment of Sanjiv Sachar, Sandeep Parekh, and MD Ranganath as additional independent directors on the board.

41,2019-06-12,HDFC Bank,"RBI unlikely to revisit retirement age for MDs and CEOs of private lenders


Private sector banks that have been hoping to get an extension for their chiefs after the age of 70 may be in for disappointment as the Reserve Bank of India is understood to be not amenable to the idea.
“There is a view that the current norms were formulated after much thought and discussion and have served the sector well. 
“The RBI may not accept a proposal to extend the age limit beyond the current 70 years, especially as it could be seen to be a one-off exception,” said a person familiar with the development, noting that the retirement age for public sector banks remains 60 years.
The issue assumes significance given that the MDs and CEOs of two private sector lenders – IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank – are due to retire next year.
IndusInd Bank MD and CEO Romesh Sobti will retire in March 2020, while Aditya Puri, who heads HDFC Bank, will retire in October next year when they turn 70. 
Following this, they will not be eligible for re-appointment based on current RBI guidelines.
Market experts believe that the test case may be IndusInd Bank, and if the RBI agrees to the re-appointment of Sobti, then HDFC Bank could also send a similar proposal. 
Sources said if at all the issue has to be revisited, it will be done with due process and as a policy decision, adding that as of now no concrete proposal has been submitted to the RBI on this issue. During the fourth quarter results conference of IndusInd Bank, Sobti had indicated that he would be willing to continue at the bank, but said it was up to the RBI to review the age norms. 
He had also said the bank was working on a succession plan roadmap for the last four years and has been grooming candidates.
Meanwhile, HDFC Bank, in its annual report 2018-19, has said the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the board would soon set up a search committee to scout for potential successors to Puri.
“With respect to the tenure of the current Managing Director ending in October 2020, the board will identify a successor and work to ensure that this is done in a manner that will allow appropriate time for an effective transition of responsibilities,” the annual report said."

39,2019-06-16,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank - Notable earnings: Buy 
The ongoing turmoil in the non-banking finance space and no significant recovery in the earnings of public sector banks have turned investors’ focus back to select private sector banks that have managed to grow earnings steadily over the past year, despite headwinds in the sector.
HDFC Bank’s strong loan growth, steady margins, improving cost-to-income ratio and stable asset quality, led to earnings growth of 20.5 per cent Y-o-Y in FY19.
At the current price, the stock trades at about 3.8 times its one-year forward book value. This is within its long-term (five-year) range of 3.4-4 times, despite the 20 per cent rally in the stock over the past year.
Steady earnings growth of 18-20 per cent over the past four quarters has kept the stock’s valuation at a reasonable level.
Long-term investors can buy the stock at current levels.








 
Over the past few years, even as its peers have been dogged by asset quality issues, HDFC Bank has managed to keep its earnings in good stead. Between FY16 and FY19, the bank’s loans have grown by about 21 per cent CAGR (compounded annual growth rate). Net interest margins have been steady at 4.3 per cent levels, while the bank’s cost-to-income ratio has fallen substantially to 39.9 per cent in FY19 (from 44.3 per cent in FY16).
With asset quality more or less stable (rise in bad loans in absolute terms offset by strong growth in loans), net profit has grown by a healthy 20 per cent CAGR between FY16 and FY19.
After delivering sub-20 per cent loan growth in the previous two fiscals, HDFC Bank managed a higher 24 per cent loan growth in the FY19 fiscal. The growth was backed by strong uptick in corporate loan growth, even as there was a considerable slowdown in retail loan growth, owing to the underlying weakness in the four-/two-wheeler segments.
After reporting a robust 27 per cent growth in FY16, overall loan growth moderated to 18-19 per cent levels in FY17 and FY18. Slowdown in corporate loans had affected growth in FY17. In particular, in the December 2016 quarter, corporate loan growth was impacted by the unwinding of the leveraged product the bank offered under the FCNR deposit scheme and repayment of some of the working capital loans by SMEs, post-demonetisation. In FY18, corporate loans grew by a more modest 9 per cent. In FY19, there has been a significant pick up in corporate loan growth (at 31 per cent).
On the other hand, retail loans — that have been a key driver of growth for HDFC Bank in the past few fiscals — grew by a lower 19 per cent in FY19 (from 26-27 per cent growth levels in FY17 and FY18). Significant slowdown in growth across most segments — in particular, auto, two-wheeler, business banking and Kisan Gold Cards — impacted retail loan growth in FY19. As a result, retail loans constituted 54 per cent of the overall loan portfolio as of March 2019 (from 57 per cent in FY18).
While the spurt in corporate loans may moderate, and the underlying weak trends in the retail space may persist in the near term, a diversified loan book should keep growth in good stead over the long run. Good traction in lending to high-rated corporates and BS-VI pre-buying driving CV financing in the later part of the fiscal, should also augur well for growth.








 
As of March 2019, the bank’s deposits stood at ₹923,141 crore, a healthy growth of 17 per cent Y-o-Y. While the savings deposits grew by a lower 11 per cent, the bank indicated that this was due to migration of customers to fixed deposits, where the rates are higher. Overall, the bank had a healthy low-cost CASA (current account savings account) deposit ratio of 42.4 per cent, which should continue to aid margins.
Since FY17, gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) for the bank, in absolute terms, have been growing 30-40 per cent Y-o-Y. However, strong growth in loans has kept delinquency ratio (GNPA as a per cent of loans) under check. But the bank has been facing stress in its agri portfolio, which may need a watch. That said, a higher provision coverage ratio of 71 per cent (floating provisions of ₹1,451 crore) mitigates risk. HDFC Bank’s GNPAs, that was hovering around the 1 per cent mark in the past, inched up slightly over the past one year — in the latest March quarter, the bank’s GNPA stood at 1.36 per cent of loans.
The bank is well-capitalised to fund growth over the medium term. Its total capital adequacy ratio stood at 17.1 per cent as of March 2019, against a regulatory requirement of 11.025 per cent (including capital conservation buffer and an additional requirement of 0.15 per cent on account of it being identified as a Domestic Systemically Important Bank). Tier 1 capital adequacy was 15.8 per cent."
38,2019-06-17,HDFC Bank,"Private banks cut interest rates on deposits by up to 25 bps
 Top private sector lenders have cut their interest rates on deposits by up to 0.25 per cent over the last week, officials said Monday.
Generally, an interest rate cut in deposits is seen as a precursor to a lending rate cut. The moves by lenders including ICICI Bank and Axis Bank come amid easing liquidity conditions and also within days of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank earlier this month.
The RBI is betting on rate cuts, and a subsequent pass-on of the same by the banks to borrowers, as one of the ways to prop-up the sagging economic growth.
ICICI Bank is understood to have cut its fixed deposit rates by 0.10-0.25 per cent starting from Monday, officials said.
Under the revised rates for domestic deposits under Rs 2 crore, ICICI Bank will be paying 6.75 per cent for a deposit of 290 days to under a year, and 7.30 per cent for a deposit of over two years to under three years, according to the rates on the bank’s website.
Its smaller rival Axis Bank has cut its deposit rates by up to 0.15 per cent in select buckets, a bank spokesperson said.
All the downward reviews have been for deposits of over one year, the spokesperson said.
On the quantum of the cuts, a majority of them have been 0.15 per cent, while in the case of deposits of over Rs 2 crore for a period between 3-5 years, the cut is 0.10 per cent.
Largest private sector lender HDFC Bank also seems to have done a review of its deposit rates and the revised rates are applicable from last Wednesday.
The extent of the review and the maturities in which any review has been done was not immediately available.
The bank will be paying an interest of 7.30 per cent for deposits of under Rs 2 crore for a year, according to its website."

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed a ₹1-crore penalty on private sector lender HDFC Bank for non-compliance with directions on ‘Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering norms and on reporting of frauds.
“The penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers vested in RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Section 46(4)(i) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, taking into account failure of the bank to adhere to the aforesaid directions issued by RBI,” the central bank said on Tuesday, adding that the action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance. The issue pertains to a reference to the RBI from customs authorities regarding submission of forged bill of entries (BoEs) by certain importers for remittance of foreign currency.
Further examination revealed violations of directions on ‘KYC/AML norms’ and on reporting of frauds, after which a notice was issued to HDFC Bank advising it to show cause as to why monetary penalty should not be imposed for non-compliance with RBI norms.
“After considering the bank’s reply, oral submissions made during the personal hearing and additional submissions, the RBI came to the conclusion that the charges of non-compliance with RBI directions were substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty,” it said.
“The bank has taken necessary measures to strengthen its internal control mechanisms so as to ensure that such incidents do not recur,” HDFC Bank said in a regulatory filing. HDFC Bank shares remained largely stable and closed at ₹2,416.80 apiece on the BSE."

HDFC Bank , India’s biggest lender by market value, has picked Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley to manage an initial public offering of its non-bank finance unit, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The bank plans to sell the shares in HDB Financial Services before March 31 in a deal that may raise about ₹10,000 crore ($1.4 billion), the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is not public. HDFC Bank may hire more firms for the sale later, the people said.
Selling shares in the unit will help the bank led by Managing Director Aditya Puri raise funds to expand lending as many non-bank financiers grapple with a liquidity crunch. The credit profile of HDB Financial has remained unscathed even as many other shadow lenders in the country were hit by rising borrowing costs after the nations credit market largely shunned them post a crisis at Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services last year.
HDB financial will get high valuation at listing and investors will lap it up on account of its strong capitalisation, growing retail loan book and the parentage of HDFC Bank, said Siddharth Purohit, a banking analyst at SMC Global Securities. The listing will give a valuation boost to HDFC bank too.
Spokesmen for HDFC Bank and Bank of America didn’t immediately comment while a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. HDFC Banks shares ended up 1.49 per cent to ₹2,465.

Noting that financial markets work on trust and confidence, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh has expressed confidence that the new government and the regulators will work towards re-instilling the culture of trust in the Indian banking and financial sector.
His comments are a part of his letter to shareholders in the Annual Report 2018-19 of the mortgage lender.
“Financial markets work on trust and confidence. If lending institutions do not get the support or find the courage to lend, then who will fund India’s growth aspirations and who will build India,” Parekh said, adding that the Indian financial system is moving to a new landscape with stronger regulatory and supervisory framework.
While this could entail recalibration among all players, it will lead to stronger safeguards at a systemic level, he said. He also expressed the hope that the economy will tide over the short-term challenges.
Parekh also said that retail home loans continue to be a bright spot as housing has become more affordable.
“Among retail finance in India, home loans continue to stand out — both, in terms of growth and asset quality,” he said, noting that for HDFC, the growth has come from increased volume rather than large-ticket loans.
Parekh further said that while till now the housing market in India has been looked at from the lens of young population, another demographic aspect that should be focussed on is that of senior citizens.
“By 2050, India is estimated to have 24 crore senior citizens. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has demonstrated foresight by issuing model guidelines for development and regulation of retirement homes for senior citizens,” he said."

Despite some moderation in loan growth-- owing to the underlying weakness in the four/two wheeler segments—and significant rise in provisions, HDFC Bank managed to report a healthy 21 per cent YoY growth in net profit in the latest June quarter. A lower cost to income ratio and boost from other income has aided earnings. While bad loans in absolute terms have increased 23 per cent YoY, a steady growth in loans has kept delinquency ratio (GNPA as a per cent of loans) under check at 1.4 per cent. The bank’s healthy provision cover also continues to lend comfort.
After delivering sub-20 per cent loan growth in the previous two fiscals, HDFC Bank had managed a higher 24 per cent loan growth in the FY19 fiscal. The growth was backed by strong uptick in corporate loan growth (31 per cent), even as there was a considerable slowdown in retail loan growth (19 per cent).
The spurt in corporate loans in the March quarter was expected to moderate. In the latest June quarter, corporate loans have grown by 19.6 per cent while retail loans have grown by a slower 16.5 per cent. Hence the overall loan growth has slipped to 17 per cent YoY. Slowdown in retail loans has been led by segments such as auto, two wheeler, and Kisan Gold Cards.
Nonetheless, the credit growth is healthy, given the persisting challenges in the sector.
Net interest margins have more or less remained stable at 4.3 per cent levels. The steady fall in the bank’s cost to income ratio is a positive—from 44.3 per cent levels in FY16, cost to income fell to 39.9 per cent in FY19; it has trended lower to 39.4 per cent in the latest June quarter.
While the bank’s gross non-performing assets (GNPAs), in absolute terms, has been growing at 30-40 per cent annually over the past two years, strong growth in loans has kept delinquency ratio at bay. But the bank has been facing stress in its Agri portfolio. That said, a higher provision cover (floating provisions of Rs 1451 crore) mitigate risk.

Four of the 10 most valued domestic companies together witnessed an erosion of Rs 84,432.8 crore in market capitalisation (m-cap) last week, with HDFC twins taking the biggest hit.
Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and State Bank of India (SBI) were the other frontline companies that suffered a drop in their market capitalisation (m-cap) for the week ended Friday, while Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Infosys, ITC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank finished with gains. However, the cumulative gain of these firms at Rs 22,058.3 crore was less than the total loss suffered by the four companies.

With this, the one-year MCLR for the bank is now at 8.6 per cent. The move comes just a day before the third bi-monthly monetary policy review by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)."
25,2019-08-11,HDFC Bank,"After a turbulent year, is the worst over for banks? 
At first glance, aggregate earnings of banks in the latest June quarter that ended in the black — from a loss posted in the same quarter last year, a double-digit loan growth, a fall in provisions and bad loans — usher in a sense of optimism that the worst may be over for the beaten-down sector.
But it is only when you dig deeper into individual bank results that a worrying trend of rise in slippages and stressed book, weak core performance, and low NPA recoveries emerges.
In the March 2018 quarter, after the RBI’s earlier circular on resolution of stressed accounts, banks had reported steep rise in slippages (over ₹1-lakh crore in that quarter alone) and provisioning.
The large pile up of bad loans continued to weigh on banks’ earnings in the following quarters through FY19.
Hence, against a sombre performance last year, the numbers reported by banks in the latest June quarter look optically good. For instance, PSBs had reported a loss of over ₹12,000 crore last June quarter, as against a profit of over ₹4,000 crore in the June quarter this year.
In the private bank space too, a low-profit base has made this year’s June quarter earnings appear healthy.
ICICI Bank had reported a loss of ₹120 crore in the June quarter last year; it delivered a profit of ₹1,908 crore in the June quarter this year.
But asset quality and core performance of some leading PSBs and private sector banks suggest that earnings could be under pressure in the upcoming quarters.
While the headline bad loan numbers have declined by about 5 per cent Y-o-Y, they have inched up sequentially, compared with the March quarter.










Banks’ exposure to certain stressed companies in the NBFC space and Reliance ADAG Group has resulted in slippages and increase in stressed book. For YES Bank, a significant rise in slippages and a rise in stressed accounts remain a concern. The slippages went up to ₹6,232 crore in the June quarter from ₹3,481 crore in the March quarter. YES Bank had identified ₹10,000 crore of stressed accounts in real estate, media and entertainment and infrastructure sectors in the March quarter; this went up to ₹29,470 crore in the June quarter.
For ICICI Bank, while overall slippages fell notably in the June quarter to ₹2,779 crore from ₹3,547 crore in the March quarter, there were additions to retail bad loans (₹1,511 crore of slippages), which included ₹452-crore slippages from the Kisan Credit Card portfolio. Also, the stressed book — BB and below-rated — remains significant at ₹15,355 crore. For Axis Bank, gross slippages went up to ₹4,798 crore; it was the substantial write-offs of ₹3,005 crore (rather than recovery) that led to the marginal decline in bad loans.
HDFC Bank has continued to keep asset-quality pressure at bay. While the bank’s GNPAs, in absolute terms, has been growing at 30-40 per cent annually over the past two years, strong growth in loans has kept the delinquency ratio (1.4 per cent of loans) under check. But the bank has been facing stress in its agri portfolio.
The trend in PSBs has not been comforting. The first quarterly results of Bank of Baroda, after its merger with Vijaya and Dena Bank, had signs of stress on profitability and asset quality. While bad loans came down marginally in absolute terms, slippages and write-offs remained elevated.
As of June, the watchlist of the merged entity is a huge ₹16,500 crore — slippages from this can lead to higher provisioning in the coming quarters. For PNB, a still large loan book and deferment of provisions with respect to certain frauds can add pressure on earnings. SBI, the country’s largest bank, saw slippages of ₹16,212 crore (from ₹7,505 crore in the March quarter). This is hardly comforting for a bank already sitting on a bad loan book of over ₹1.6-lakh crore.
A substantial pool of stressed assets remains a concern, and quick resolution of large accounts under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) will be critical.
On the core performance front, private banks grew their loan book at a faster clip compared to PSBs. ICICI Bank reported a growth of 18 per cent in domestic loans, led by 22 per cent in retail. Its net interest income grew by a strong 27 per cent Y-o-Y in the June quarter. HDFC Bank delivered growth of 17 per cent in loans and 23 per cent in NII. Axis Bank’s domestic loan growth was a healthy 19 per cent.
For State-owned bank PNB, a notable 12 per cent fall in NII and a weak capital ratio are a concern. SBI’s domestic loan growth stood at 12 per cent in the June quarter, lagging behind leading private sector banks."

HDFC Bank on Wednesday said its expenditure on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in FY2019 was at ₹443. 8 crore, 20 per cent more than the previous year.
In its first Integrated Report, the private sector bank claimed that it has impacted over 5 crore lives through its social initiative ""Parivartan"" as on March 31, 2019.
With over 96 lakh beneficiaries - all women - Sustainable Livelihood Initiative (SLI) has been the single biggest contributor to impacting over 5 crore Indians, the Bank said in a statement. “This is equivalent to 3.84 crore individuals (96 *4 per family). Under SLI, women are given occupational skills training, financial literacy, and credit counselling in addition to credit through Self-Help Groups or Joint Liability Groups,” it added.
With 15 lakh teachers and a potential 1.6 crore students, ‘Teaching–the–Teacher’ programme has been the second-biggest contributor. The rest came from the Holistic Rural Development Programme, Healthcare & Hygiene, and Skills Training & Livelihood Enhancement Initiative (excluding SLI beneficiaries)."

Parag Rao, Country Head - Payments Business, Marketing, HDFC Bank


The country’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank remains bullish on its cards business and said it has not witnessed a slowdown in consumption.
“In consumer finance, we are seeing robust growth in all sectors. We expect to grow further with the festival season,” said Parag Rao, Country Head - Payments Business, Marketing, HDFC Bank, pointing out that some segments have shown a slowdown but it is cyclical and not systemic.
The lender is not seeing any stress in its credit card business and non-performing assets remain well within control.
“There is no stress in our credit card business because we have not diluted our credit norms. It is important to choose the right credit and know what not to do,” Rao said.
About 60-65 per cent of the bank’s credit card customers are salaried and the remaining are self-employed.
His comments come at a time when there are concerns about a slowdown in the economy and stress in non-banking finance companies and its impact on unsecured loans. HDFC Bank also continues to see a big opportunity in the payments sector and expects its credit and debit cards business to double this fiscal. “The opportunity in the digital market is significant. We are barely at 10-12 per cent of penetration,” Rao told BusinessLine.
The bank is investing in customer acquisition and merchant acquisition. “We will be a large merchant acquirer and will enable the merchant to accept any form the customer wants to pay by,” Rao said.
The lender currently has 1.3 crore credit cards and 2.7 crore debit cards and expects “2x growth in the segment on a monthly basis”.
HDFC Bank is targeting the millennials in the age group of 20 to 35 years and has launched a new range of cards — debit, credit, EMI and prepaid — for the segment.
Rao said he is hopeful of achieving at least 20 lakh cards from the millennials segment in the next two years. HDFC Bank is also hoping to triple its merchant acquiring business this fiscal. The bank has about 17 lakh acceptance points and eight lakh merchants across all categories."

20,2019-09-26,HDFC Bank,"Flipkart tops Forrester's Customer Experience Index India rankings
Walmart's acquisition of Flipkart seems to be working for the e-commerce company as it has emerged as the top brand in the digital retailer's category in Forrester's Customer Experience Index (CX Index) India rankings for 2019.
Shoppers Stop, Toyota Kirloskar and HDFC Bank are among the top four brands that have scored high on the overall index.
Based on a survey of more than 10,000 customers in India in 2019, Forrester’s CX Index methodology was used to benchmark the CX quality of 39 brands in six industries. This year’s findings show that Indian brands improved their CX quality tremendously with 33 of 39 brands delivered good CX, up from 19 last year.
In the digital retailers’ category, Flipkart improved their score by almost 10 points to go from fourth in 2018 to the top spot this year, beating out other digital retailers like Snapdeal, Koovs.com, Shopclues, Myntra, Amazon and Jabong. This is the first time in the last few years, Flipkart has overtaken Amazon in terms of their customer experience. Amazon was first in 2016, and Koovs.com topped in 2017 and 2018 (Amazon was second both years).
HDFC Bank was the only brand in India that improved its CX more than the competition. The industry average for banks went up over 5 points to retain pole position, while the multichannel retail industry rose more than 7 points to go from last to second.
Despite increase in their average scores, auto and home insurers fell from third to fifth, and credit card issuers — last year's second — was at the bottom of the rankings. The digital retailer and automotive manufacturer industries were third and fourth respectively.
""We see an improvement in CX quality as firms are transforming their culture to be more customer-centric. Another trend that we see if that brands are investing in emerging technology and improving understanding of customer needs to improve their innovation ability. This is especially evident in the banking industry where many banks not just refresh their apps frequently but also redesign them from scratch,"" Forrester said in a statement.
“We see that Indian firms are transforming their culture to become customer-centric and adopting design practices to improve customer experiences,” said Amit Bhatia, Forrester senior analyst. “However, only brands that can differentiate themselves will reap the benefits of better CX. Brands that want to break away from the pack should focus on emotion: How an experience makes customers feel has a bigger influence on their loyalty to a brand than effectiveness or ease in nearly every industry.”"

 Largest private sector lender HDFC Bank has emerged as the most valued Indian brand at USD 22.70 billion.
The list of top ten brands, prepared by the world’s largest media buyer WPP, includes companies from banking, financial services and insurance, telecom and auto segments. A brand’s overall fortunes had a direct bearing on the brand valuations, as seen in the telecom space, where Airtel’s value fell by 10 per cent to USD 10 billion, while Reliance Jio’s value went up by 34 per cent to USD 5.47 billion.
The Mukesh Ambani-run largest telco was placed ninth in the list of brands, while the second largest telcom firm was still holding to the fourth place. Among the state-run companies, insurance behemoth LIC was placed second, valued at USD 20 billion with a 2 per cent growth, while banking giant SBI was fifth at USD 8.40 billion with a surge of 7 per cent.
Slowdown in the auto sector seemed to be playing on the valuations of largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki, which had its brand value come down by 14 per cent to USD 5.93 billion."
17,2019-09-27,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank retains ranking as India’s valuable brand
 
HDFC Bank retained the numero uno spot for the sixth consecutive year in the sixth edition of BrandZ Top 75 Most Valuable Indian Brands ranking, released by WPP and Kantar. The bank managed to do this by “maintaining a forward-thinking and innovative outlook, with its consistent focus on exceeding the changing needs of its customers.”
With a 2019 brand value pegged at $22.70 billion, HDFC’s brand value has only changed 5 per cent, with Vishikh Talwar, Chief Client Officer, Kantar Insights Division saying if the brand “continues to do what it has been doing, staying ahead of competition, answering all queries, connecting with consumers and delivering, it will manage to stay ahead.”
This, he noted, is a positive contrast to the 8 per cent decline in value of the top 20 global banks.
LIC took the second spot in the BrandZ listing with 2019 brand value pegged at $20.13 billion, while Tata Consultancy Services took the third spot with 2019 brand value at $18.16 billion, registering 21 percent change in brand value as compared to last year.
Airtel in the fourth spot at $10.28 billion had a downward value change of 10 percent, while State Bank of India with a brand value of $8.4 billion was in the fifth position.
The fastest riser in the 2019 ranking was Jio, which climbed one place to No 9 with a 34 percent increase in brand value to $5.47 billion. Vodafone at $2.5 billion, was the top-ranked newcomer at No 24 in the list.
India’s most valuable brands, many of which have built their businesses through disruption, are looking to capitalise on their achievements. Speakers at the seminar ennumerated the many decisions that companies are taking to achieve their growth target.
The BrandZ study, which is the only brand valuation ranking to combine companies’ financial data with consumer insight and opinion, shows that trust is key and that highly trusted brands in the Top 75 are worth 129 percent more than less trusted ones.
Speaking about consumer trust, a common thread among successful brands, Preeti Reddy, CEO South Asia, Insights Division, Kantar said only a few have succeeded in growing trust over the last five years. “Those who done so, have done it through open and honest conversations with their customers. Trust is the shield that gives a brand the resilience to face headwinds in uncertain times,” she added."

Private sector lender HDFC Bank, on Monday, took the battle on consumption straight to e-commerce majors with a three-month long campaign offering best deals on transactions through its platform.
The bank also listed out targets for merchant acquisitions, and said that it is aiming for a 5 percentage points reduction in its cost-to-income ratio as a result of the digital push.
The aggressive posturing comes at a time when the massive slump in consumption is being blamed for the overall economic gloom which pulled down the GDP to a six-year low in the June quarter at a 5 per cent.
The bank has tied up with more than 1,000 major brands such as Reliance Digital, Samsung, Apple etc. “The discounts will be available on both its debit and credit cards,” the bank said. “You get mega offers on Flipkart and Amazon for three-four days alone. We are launching this campaign for three months,” Managing Director and Chief Executive Aditya Puri said.
Puri said the bank is going through a major transformation to re-define it altogether and will compete to garner as wide a share of a customer’s wallet as possible. He said that the bank will aggregate offers from across merchants and present its users with the best offers on its website.
“It is targeting to have a complete omnichannel presence which will help a user do banking transactions, loans and shopping across channels like net banking and mobile app by March,” he said.
The bank is also adding 1 million merchant touch-points this fiscal, and is aiming for a similar number next fiscal to have up to 5 million merchant touch points by 2021.
“This is possible largely through digital solutions like QR codes and smartphone-based apps,” he said, adding that using this also helps drive down the costs compared to the expensive card swipe machines.
Through a variety of initiatives pivoted around digitisation, the bank is targeting to decrease its cost to income ratio by 5 percentage points to the 35 per cent in the next five years, Puri said, adding that the bank will continue to hire people and also open branches, which will be smaller in size and will act primarily like a sales and service outlet for customers."

Customers will be able to get special offers on all banking products – from loans to bank accounts – and also discounts on retail and consumer goods via retail branches and digital platforms, including the website, PayZapp, and SmartBuy. “This is an all encompassing one-stop campaign where every financial solution for a retail customer or a business customer will be available – the entire spectrum from festival shopping to unsecured loans, business loans and loan against property as well as special partnerships,” Arvind Vohra, Country Head, branch banking, HDFC Bank, told BusinessLine, adding that it will be available at more than 10,000 stores.
“You get mega offers on Flipkart and Amazon for three to four days alone. We are launching this campaign for three months,” said Aditya Puri, Managing Director and CEO, HDFC Bank. Vohra said the bank is also looking at merchant acquisition and has a target of 10 lakh for this fiscal through a “dukaandar dhamaka” programme. The bank is also hopeful of more customer acquisition through engagements, including this campaign, the planned 1,000 grameen loan melas, and planned over 4,000 corporate employee shopper activations.
According to industry estimates, the bank registered a 12 per cent growth in its retail customer base in June 2019 against a year ago.

 Private sector lender HDFC Bank remains upbeat about consumption demand despite concerns over a slowdown and has defended its decision to revoke security in order to safeguard its exposure to Altico Capital.
“In my view, specific security is specific to the bank. That is the basis of the loan, that is commercial practice and that is the global practice,” Aditya Puri, Managing Director and CEO, HDFC Bank, told reporters on Monday.
State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar had on September 14 slammed a private sector lender for acting in a “selfish” manner and triggering the crisis at Altico Capital, which could also have wider implications for the financial system.
Puri, however, did not comment on the SBI chief’s statement. “Rajnish Kumar is a seasoned banker, a good friend and we are a democracy,” he said.
Real estate-focussed NBFC Altico Capital had last month said it had defaulted on interest payment of ₹19.97 crore on the external commercial borrowing (ECB) it had raised from Mashreqbank.
According to reports, HDFC Bank had encashed the fixed deposit quickly after the crisis broke out.
Meanwhile, Puri also said that a search panel of the board announced earlier will be formed by January 2020 to appoint a new Managing Director and CEO. This will ensure that Puri’s successor gets to work with him for one to two months.
Puri, who has been associated with HDFC Bank since 1994, will retire in October 2020 on attaining the age of 70.
The private sector lender has also launched a three-month long financial services campaign called Festive Treats to offer discounts on over 1,000 brands and special banking facilities.
Puri emphasised that there has been no stress in the bank’s credit portfolio."

How HDFC Bank Q2 profit jumped 27% despite lower growth in core net interest income

Amid a challenging environment and persisting stress reported by peers, HDFC Bank managed to put up a steady performance in the September quarter. In fact, after delivering a net profit growth of 20-22 per cent in the previous four quarters, the leading private sector bank reported a strong 27 per cent growth in net profit in the September quarter. While this, and the fact that the bank has maintained a stable asset quality, is sure to cheer investors, there may be some less obvious trends that need a watch.
Read more: HDFC Bank Q2 net profit up 26.8 per cent
For one, the boost in net profit can be credited to the robust growth in the other income component. Besides the healthy growth in fee income, other income was also aided by a gain on sale/revaluation of investments in the September quarter, as against a loss in the same quarter last year. But for the boost from the other income component, the significant moderation in growth in the bank’s core net interest income could have impacted earnings. What also drove net profit was the substantial reduction in the effective tax rate in the latest September quarter (29.5 per cent), vis-à-vis last year (34.6 per cent). A sharp slowdown in retail loan growth, fall in net interest margin and a notable shift in the retail : wholesale loan mix - are other key trends that may need to be monitored in the coming quarters.

Nonetheless, given the happenings in the banking sector, HDFC Bank’s steady asset quality performance and better earnings visibility, is likely to drive the stock’s premium valuations in the medium term.
After delivering sub-20 per cent loan growth in FY17 and FY18, HDFC Bank had managed a 24 per cent loan growth in the FY19 fiscal. The growth was backed by strong uptick in corporate loan growth, even as retail loan growth slowed considerably.
In the June quarter of the current fiscal (FY20), the bank’s loan growth moderated significantly to 18 per cent, with sharp slowdown in retail credit off-take. In the latest September quarter, the bank managed to report a higher overall loan growth of 20.7 per cent (domestic). But this was led by robust growth of 28 per cent in corporate loans, while the growth in retail loans continued to moderate significantly.
In FY19, the bank had delivered 19 per cent growth in retail loans (down from 27 per cent in FY18). Over the past two quarters, the retail loan growth has slowed down further - 16.5 per cent in the June quarter to 14.7 per cent in the latest September quarter.
The slowdown in retail loans has been led by segments such as auto (flat), two wheeler (1.7 per cent YoY growth), CV/construction equipment (11.7 per cent) and Kisan Gold Cards (8 per cent).
The slowdown in high-yielding retail loans and fall in lending rates could likely have led to HDFC Bank’s net interest margin falling to 4.2 per cent in the September quarter, from 4.3 per cent in the previous June quarter. The bank’s retail:wholesale mix stands at 52:48, a significant deviation from the past few quarters’ trend of 54:46.
However, the steady fall in the bank’s cost to income ratio is a positive - from 44.3 per cent levels in FY16, cost to income has been steadily falling for the bank. In the September quarter it stood at 38.8 per cent, aiding margins.
For HDFC Bank, a healthy growth in loans, has kept the delinquency ratio low, despite rise in bad loans in absolute terms. While the bank’s gross non-performing assets (GNPAs), has been growing at 20-30 per cent (YoY) in the past few quarters, good growth in loans has kept GNPA ratio low. As of September quarter, the bank’s GNPA ratio was a low 1.38 per cent. But the bank has been facing stress in its Agri portfolio."

Economic growth has probably reached a trough and the pace of GDP expansion will start rising by January next year, HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri has said.
While the crisis with the shadow banks is over, there may be a few companies, especially with exposure to the realty space, that may face problems in the future, Puri told PTI in an interview. The comments were made at an interaction before the RBI sharply revised down its GDP growth target to 6.1 per cent on Friday. The GDP growth has slipped to a six-year low of 5 per cent in the June quarter.
“I am not saying boisterous or we are going to have a runaway boom. I am saying that as we are moving ahead, growth will move higher from where it is. We are probably at the trough, Puri said. He said higher government spending, investment in infrastructure, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s move to get more money into the economy and a good monsoon will support the growth.
However, given the very large size of India, the measures will take time to yield results, Puri said, adding that by January, he expects a pick-up in the economic growth. Banks are witnessing demand for working capital loans at present, he said, adding that the capacity utilisation needs to move up to 80 per cent from the present 77 per cent for investments to happen and it may take some time for the same.
Replying to a query on the fiscal side worries, Puri said while it is reasonable to expect a widening of the fiscal gap, he is confident that the same can be bridged through higher disinvestments, better collections of both GST and the income tax, and not worry too much about a marginal slippage. On the issues surrounding the NBFCs (non-banking finance companies), he said the crisis is gone, but there is no easy solution and things will take time to settle down.
There may be a few more entities especially having exposure to the realty segment, which will face difficulties, he said, answering a question on recent developments at Altico Capital. The crisis is over, the problem is not over. There will be a few like these. The ALM issue will have to be rectified. I don’t think there are any unrecognised large NBFCs which will move into a problem, he said.
Stressing that an NBFC going down does not create systemic risks because such entities are not a part of the clearing system, he welcomed efforts like portfolio sell-offs, bringing equity and improvements in cashflows. The RBI has also taken measures to help the sector and the state-run banks have also started lending, he said, adding that we need to keep monitoring the sector in the future. On HDFC Bank’s plans, he said it will very well capitalised and will not be needing capital for at least three more years.
Marketing efforts
We are seeing growth in demand, he said, adding that the bank has started lending to newer segments like the small businesses, and even shopkeepers because of technology tools. It has started to go beyond the top 4 million consumers in the country and is now addressing the top 6.5 million consumers courtesy the data it has and also through targeted marketing efforts, he said.
He said the quality of its unsecured book is also quite safe and the bank expects this stream to continue growing. On the term loans side, Puri said the bank has participated in road and renewable energy projects, and stressed the need to have good projects for this to grow.
He defined a good project as one where appropriate risks are covered, the construction risk is covered, the owner who was supposed to make payment has been covered and the structuring is such that debt to equity is correct and assured that such will continue getting money."

Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects profit before tax to grow 20.5 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 9,230 crore vs Rs 8,530 crore and PAT to grow 19.5 per cent to Rs 5,981 crore. Asset quality is expected to remain stable, with GNPA at about 1.4 per cent added.

Elara Securities expect HDFC Bank to report 16.1 per cent growth y-o-y on topline at Rs 1,832.41 crore and 21 per cent growth in net profit of Rs 6,054.6 crore.
HDFC Bank disclosed (y-o-y) credit and deposit expansion at 19 per cent and 22 per cent respectively. ""We believe this was largely attributed to its efforts toward credit penetration in rural areas through digitisation and market share gains from public sector banks, which are undergoing consolidation, Elara added.
Reliance Securities says, Moderation in loan book growth likely and margins expected to remain stable sequentially. It also said operating efficiencies and tax cuts to boost earnings.
The broking firm expects NII growth of 15.3 per cent at Rs 13,565 crore (Rs 11,763.40 crore); PAT to grow 22. 8 per cent at Rs 6,146 crore (Rs 5,005.70 crore).
However, Kotak Institutional Equities expects loan growth to slow down to nearly 16% y-o-y resulting in slower NII growth at nearly 19 per cent y-o-y. The retail loan growth slowdown is on account of weak volume growth in auto and a more cautious approach towards unsecured loans. Fee income growth from MFs will be slower y-o-y due to changes in regulations even as asset and payment fees will grow at a slower rate"".
The broking house expects HDFC Bank to report an adjusted profit of Rs 6,373.90 crore (Rs 5,005.70 crore) and NII of Rs 14,0388 crore (Rs 11,763.40 crore)"

Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC
   -  BusinessLine


HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh, on Wednesday, called for a one-time restructuring of certain real estate loans as a means to overcome the “current crisis of confidence” that has beset the housing finance and NBFC sector. “Personally, I do believe that we can overcome this crisis of confidence if lenders are allowed a one-time restructuring of certain real estate loans – particularly for stuck projects – where building approvals have been delayed,” he said, adding that if these restructured accounts are considered as standard assets for a period of 12 months or so, lenders will stop being so diffident.
Noting that critics may argue that this is just kicking NPAs down the road, Parekh said he has a different opinion. “But my stance is that real estate loans are different. The value of the land is always there,” he said.
Parekh also noted that there are pressing issues facing the Indian real estate market, and stressed that timelines of action will prevent further haemorrhage. “One cannot sugar coat the fact that there is pain and the trust deficit is clogging the flow of liquidity to where it is needed the most. There are developers who genuinely need last-mile funding,” he stressed, adding that we can’t afford a situation where “we cut off oxygen for even the stronger developers”, and this could happen if the risk averseness prolongs."

6,2019-11-28,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank sets up committee to identify successor to Aditya Puri 


Private sector lender HDFC Bank on Thursday set up a search committee to identify possible candidates to take over from its current Managing Director and CEO Aditya Puri.
“The Board of Directors of the Bank, at its meeting held today, has constituted a Search Committee to identify a successor to Aditya Puri, the current Managing Director of the Bank, whose tenure ends on October 26, 2020,”it said in a regulatory filing.
The six member committee would include the bank’s Part Time Non- Executive Chairperson Shyamala Gopinath, independent directors Sanjiv Sachar, MD Ranganath, Sandeep Parekh and non-executive directors Srikanth Nadhamuni and Keki Mistry (representative of Housing Development Finance Corporation).
Puri will act as an advisor to the Search Committee.
“The Search Committee, over the next few months, shall evaluate internal and external candidates to ensure smooth transition,” HDFC Bank further said.
Puri, who has been associated with HDFC Bank since 1994, will retire in October 2020 on attaining the age of 70 years.
Earlier, the bank in its Annual Report 2018-19 had said that the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board will constitute a Search Committee to undertake a global search of both internal and external candidates.
“...the Board will identify a successor and work to ensure that this is done in a manner that will allow appropriate time for an effective transition of responsibilities,” the report had said.
The Bank’s board will have to then have to recommend the names of short-listed candidates and seek approval from the Reserve Bank of India for the appointment."
5,2019-12-02,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank, Walmart India to launch co-branded credit card 


 In a first for both—HDFC Bank and Walmart India have joined hands to launch a co-branded credit card to over a million members (mostly Kiranas) of the latter’s, Best Price Modern Wholesale format in the country.
Atthe national launch at Walmart’s store in Hyderabad, Krish Iyer, it’s India President & CEO, Parag Rao, Country Head, Payments Business of HDFC and Annie Zhang, Regional Managing Director, APAC of Discover Financials and Diners Club International participated.
Not just the ease of payment in the digital mode, but the co-branded card will provide incentives like 18-50 day credit, rewards and cash backs to the members. The card was launched simultaneously at all the 26 other best price stores in the country.
Krish Iyer said, with 27 stores in nine States opened in a decade in India, Walmart is on road to its expansion plans. The next store will be opened in Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh in a week, he announced.
To questions, he clarified that the initiative of Flipkart-Axis Bank card was different as Walmart is an investor in Flipkart and it was a separate entity. He also did not field questions on its losses of late.
 The co-branded card will enable registered members of Walmart India to pay for their purchases, in addition to other payment solutions available to them. The effort is also a push to adoption of digital payments in the country, he added.
The Card is being supported by Diners Card International which has acceptance of its own membership card in 185 countries and is among the first to offer Cards, way back in the 1950’s said Annie Zhang.
 Parag Rao of HDFC said the offering to the large number of retailers through the card is in line with the company’s strength and growth in the small & medium enterprises sector, which is a backbone for the economy. He did not feel the slowdown in the economy will impact much on their portfolio in the sector."
4,2019-12-03,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank sees signs of rural revival
HDFC Bank sees tentative signs of revival in rural areas at a time when the wider economy is sputtering. “The recent loan outreach programmes under way in rural areas have given us the sense that consumption in rural and semi-urban areas is turning more positive,” said HDFC Bank Executive Director Kaizad Bharucha. As of September-end, 52 per cent of the bank’s outlets were in rural and semi-urban India, a part of the economy that accounts for at least half of the national output.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has unveiled several steps to boost the economy, which is growing at its weakest pace in more than six years, including a corporate tax cut. The Reserve Bank of India is expected to cut interest rates again this week after reports showed that gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed to 4.5 per cent in the September quarter.
For HDFC Bank, the weaker economy had led to a slowdown in loan growth, which eased to 15 per cent in the September quarter from 23 per cent a year earlier. But it remained healthy compared to the overall banking system, which saw credit growth slowing to a two-year low just above 8 per cent.
“As a bank we are well positioned to offset a slowdown in either the consumption or investment side as we are present across the spectrum,” said Bharucha. The demand for credit is not going away. It may just be subdued for a period of time, he added.
He is also cautiously optimistic about the outlook for corporate investment, based on the bank’s soundings with Indian executives. Muted loan growth has hardly dented the upward march in HDFC Bank’s shares, which are about 20 per cent higher so far this year. Now valued at about $96 billion, the company trades around 26 times projected 12-month earnings. That is almost three times more expensive than the Bloomberg World Bank’s Index, and is the biggest valuation premium on record.
Meanwhile, non-bank lenders from Dewan Housing Finance Corp to Reliance Capital have been reeling under a 17-month credit crisis after Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services defaulted on its debt last year. In a further blow to confidence, the Securities and Exchange Board of India placed curbs on operations of Karvy Stock Broking after finding evidence it misused client funds.
But Bharucha does not see a wider industry problem. “There is enough control over stockbrokers and depositories and a default in the segment will not have a systemic impact,” he said. The central bank has ensured that there is adequate liquidity in the system and availability of credit is not a problem."

Private sector lender HDFC Bank’s Internet and Mobile banking services continued to be down for the third consecutive day on Wednesday.
Users who try to log into the facility get a message from the bank:  “We apologize, but this facility is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.”
Responding to complaints on Twitter, the Bank tweeted on Tuesday, “We apologise that the resolution of the technical glitch is taking more time than anticipated. Our experts are working round the clock. While customers are able to transact using the netbanking and mobile banking app, a few may still be facing intermittent issues.”
It further said, “Needless to say this is not the experience we would like our customers to have and we sincerely regret the inconvenience.”"
2,2019-12-04,HDFC Bank,"After three days of snag, HDFC Bank’s digital services back to normal


Private sector lender HDFC Bank’s net and mobile banking services, which were facing an outage for nearly three days, began to normalise by Wednesday evening.
“The bank has been working hard to normalise operations,” said industry sources, adding that the reasons behind the snag will be looked into and addressed once the services are completely up and running.
Earlier, users who tried to log into the facility, received a message from the bank that said: “We apologise, but this facility is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.”
Responding to complaints on Twitter, the bank tweeted on Tuesday: “We apologise that the resolution of the technical glitch is taking more time than anticipated.

While customers are able to transact using netbanking and mobile banking app, a few may still be facing intermittent issues.” It further said: “Needless to say, this is not the experience we would like our customers to have, and we sincerely regret the inconvenience.”
HDFC Bank is the largest private sector lender in the country and the outage comes at the beginning of the month when customers have to carry out a slew of transactions, including bill payments and EMIs. HDFC Bank is understood to have one the largest salary account customer base in the country.
For credit-card payments, the bank has suggested using alternatives such as ATM or NEFT transfer, cheque or over-the-counter cash payment, and the option of autopay."

Rahul Shukla, Group Head (Corporate and Business Banking), HDFC Bank




Rahul Shukla, Group Head (Corporate and Business Banking), HDFC Bank


 
 
HDFC Bank remains upbeat about its wholesale business at a time when most lenders are looking to growth their retail business. “As one of the largest banks, we cannot say that we will focus on particular sectors,” Rahul Shukla Group Head (Corporate and Business Banking), HDFC Bank, told BusinessLine. The bank’s corporate and SME book have grown to ₹3-lakh crore by September 30. Excerpts:
How is the corporate and business banking book doing, given there is little demand?
Our second quarter numbers were very good, and the proportion of wholesale versus retail was 48 per cent versus 52 per cent. In corporate and business banking together in terms of customer assets, we have crossed ₹3-lakh crore.
Many banks are focussing only on the retail sector. What is your strategy?
We are a universal bank with a wholesale and retail book. We have an established risk parameter, and within that we go out and seek growth. In corporate banking, we continue to seek growth. We are not seeing any elevated stress in the MSME or corporate portfolio, compared to the last one year.
Are there any sectors that you will concentrate on?
Exports are subdued and private sector capex is muted, but is expected to pick up. Public sector capex is quite strong and consumption has been tepid. The public sector will remain an area of growth.
There is also a lot of push on consumption. As one of the largest banks, we cannot say that we will focus on particular sectors. In any sector, there is always a credit structure that makes the sector bankable. We have also been working with companies such as a two-wheeler player and a global smartphone player that recorded significant sales.
You have to realise that if you only push corporate banking, then maybe you will get stuck. There is an ecosystem. Every corporate needs a certain amount of topline growth, and if we are able to assist together with the full bank, as a one-bank solution, then we get growth in both the consumer and corporate side.
Is there enough credit demand?
We showed advances growth rate of 19.5 per cent. The semi-urban and rural (SURU) areas have held us in very good stead. Our disbursements in the first half of the fiscal were in the SURU location; this indicates there is potential and we just need to go deeper.
One of our goals in the SME business is to expand the number of districts where we are present. We have retail presence,which is overarching, but we will dramatically increase credit extension in the districts where we are present.
What about demand in other sectors?
At the beginning of the year, we saw greater capacity utilisation in steel, cement, textile, capital goods and paper and, then, there was a slowdown. But today, the mood is better as there has been direct stimulus through reduction in tax rates, and the chances of capex revival have improved. The second quarter results are not something that point to an apocalypse.
Is the bank still financing NBFCs?
The bank has been supporting NBFCs that are backed by corporates, multinational corporates, public sector, banks, and financial institutions. You will always find pockets within a sector where you will put out very high quality bankable credit in the marketplace. We have continued to support. That is a need.
We operate in the economy and NBFCs extend credit to people where the formal banking system may not reach, and we have to play our part and be supportive.
After issues like IL&FS where the ratings suddenly collapsed, to what extent does HDFC Bank look at rating?
Our approach is not to just lend if the external rating is great. Ratings can drop sharply. The bank’s philosophy is to do cash flow-based lending. We take a look at the cash generation potential of that entity, and if that is fine and then we decide on lending. That has held us in good stead, rather than relying on external rating or corporate structure.
Is the bank still doing project financing?
We have a very strong investment banking team that the corporate bank works with whenever there is a proposal above a certain size, whatever the sector be. That has been built by the bank in the last six years or so, and continues to gain in strength. One has to have a strategy between term and overnight, and we have to balance. We have to have a balanced book. That is the approach of the bank."
